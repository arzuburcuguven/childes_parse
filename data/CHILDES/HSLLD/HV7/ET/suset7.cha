@Comment:	The mood is comfortable for this activity. Mot and Chi play together and EXP remains in the background. Mot does most of the talking while Chi seems to control the direction of the activity with only a little input from Mot. A cat , referred to as Crybaby , often becomes the center of attention and disrupts the activity frequently. Mot and Chi play with the black base and yellow wand , making structures and picking up various objects. Although Mot and Chi take notice that a plastic bear doesn't stick to the magnets , there is no discussion of the scientific properties of magnets. Mot comments that she thought magnets were <boys' toys> when she was a child; Chi did not think that they were. Video tape does not start here; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
