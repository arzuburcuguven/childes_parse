@Comment:	MOT suggests reading the book aloud so they can remember what it's about. Mot stays silent during Chi's reading , which includes comments of a nonimmediate nature. As soon as Chi finishes reading , MOT jumps in to say <now you have to write a letter>. Chi wants to write a draft on different paper , but EXP discourages it. Mot discourages Chi from erasing each mistake , because it takes a lot of time , and context notes say Mot is very tired. Chi needs a fair amount of support in punctuation and spelling , considering how old she is. Mot provides support , but most of the ideas are Chi's. EXP pipes in too , but not a lot. Mot misspells fantastic and written. Chi asks how Eric Carle can answer her questions. EXP says they'll put a return address on the letter.
