@Comment:	MOT wants to read the book again to refresh her memory. Chi remembers many details about the story and relays them to her. Mot bends over backwards to give Chi ideas for his letter. They discuss Eric Carle's illustrations , what he might have been like as a child , where he got the idea for his book , etc. Mot keeps suggesting that Chi put some of these ideas down on paper , but Chi seems to have trouble doing that. When he does write sentences down Mot helps him with spelling and punctuation , although sometimes her punctuation is incorrect. Mot is very patient and very involved in the task. She is also very caught up in small details. She reads some of the sentences in Chi's letter out loud so he can see if they sound right. There is often much discussion over a single phrase. That is probably why the task took 45 minutes to complete.

*MOT:	or something like that .
*MOT:	what ideas ?

*MOT:	okay (.) now he wasn't hungry anymore (.) <he was> [/] he was xxx &=mumbles a big fat caterpillar .
*MOT:	he built a small house called a cocoon around himself and stayed inside for <more than two weeks> [!] .
*MOT:	(.)ahhah !
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	there's a clue .
*CHI:	this <caterpillar stayed the cocoon> [>] .
*MOT:	<for more than two weeks> [<] .
*CHI:	for (.) a month .
*MOT:	then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out .
*MOT:	but before (.) see what happened (.) on Monday [!] he ate through one apple but he was still hungry .
*MOT:	+^ on Tuesday [!] he ate two pairs .
*MOT:	on Wednesday [!] +//.
*MOT:	that's everyday isn't it ?
*CHI:	yeah (.) he slept inside these .
%sit:	Chi points to the fruit
*MOT:	well (.) <on each> [>] day he did that so he was eating every single day (.) right ?
*CHI:	<the fruit> [<] .
*MOT:	and then on Saturday he ate all [!] this .
%com:	referring to the junk food page
*MOT:	right ?
*MOT:	and then what happened ?
*MOT:	<what did he> [//] okay then Sunday .
*MOT:	so he was eating every <single day of the week> [>] +/.

*CHI:	he +...
*MOT:	he suddenly +/.
*CHI:	he didn't eat for two weeks .
*MOT:	that's right .
*MOT:	so maybe that's why he hadta get fat .
*MOT:	(.) so he could store up all the energy because now <he was using that> [//] his body was using that for two weeks (.) to feed itself .
*MOT:	(.) you know ?
*MOT:	as storage food (.) so that's <probably why> [>] +/.
*CHI:	<I thought caterpillars> [<] were like (.) humans .
*CHI:	that they could eat one like breakfast and then nothing and then they wouldn't be hungry for the rest of the day .
*MOT:	well we [/] we don't hibernate so +...
*MOT:	just once a day .
*MOT:	see they do it for two weeks so that's why he needed all that storage .
*MOT:	so_that when he came out <he was gonna be &~s> [//] he didn't eat for two weeks you'd be skinny wouldn't you ?
*MOT:	so at least he's still alive !
*CHI:	you thought I [!] didn't eat enough .
%sit:	EXP giggles .

*MOT:	<but no you're> [//] this is actually the beginning of a sentence .
*MOT:	(.) okay (be)cause this is &~u like addressing the whole thing and at the end you say (.) you know sincerely comma (.) Chi .
*MOT:	&-um (.) just like that's not a complete sentence (.) the same with this .
*MOT:	it's the opening and closing of the letter .

*CHI:	<xxx I'm gonna write my name down> [<] here at the last [!] part .
