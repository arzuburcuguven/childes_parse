*PAR0:	absolutely he likes the hard toys . 3680_13520
*PAR0:	he likes to chew on them . 13520_15460
*PAR0:	he's teething right now . 15460_17260
*PAR0:	so he &-um he went for pretty much anything that was hard that he could put in his mouth . 17260_24880
*PAR0:	he did pick up one of these toys . 24880_27900
*PAR0:	and I put it in front of him for like a second . 27900_30360
*PAR0:	but again he just wanted to eat it . 30360_32860
*PAR0:	so we tried feeding the baby the bottle . 32860_35660
*PAR0:	but he just wanted to eat the bottle himself . 35660_39580
*PAR0:	yeah pretty much he just kind of played with all this . 39580_43600
*PAR0:	and kind of went between he liked the key . 43600_45520
*PAR0:	he likes the spoons . 45520_46680
*PAR0:	he just likes to pick them up and meld them and try to eat them . 46680_50500
*PAR0:	so and I think that's what he did last time too . 50500_52860
*PAR0:	he went he always goes for the hard stuff . 52860_54480
*PAR0:	because at home we have we don't have a whole lot of stuffed animals out for him . 54480_58620
*PAR0:	and tried reading him a couple books . 58620_60260
*PAR0:	and wasn't interested . 60260_61640
*PAR0:	you're gonna go for that cord . 62220_64440
*PAR0:	aren't you [/] you cannot touch that . 64440_66420
*PAR0:	no sir no touch . 66600_68600
*PAR0:	so yeah that's pretty much went for the hard stuff . 69420_74780
*PAR0:	and he could chew on &-um what were some of the things . 74780_78620
*PAR0:	&-uh so I guess let's talk about the books . 78620_80800
*PAR0:	does he d does he &-uh like to be read to at home . 81080_83560
*PAR0:	&-um we read to him at bedtime when he's really sleepy . 83700_86440
*PAR0:	&-um me or my husband will typically read him a bedtime story at least a couple of times a week . 87060_91080
*PAR0:	&-um and yeah he enjoys it . 91360_93580
*PAR0:	and he'll even sit and just kinda listen most of time because he's winding down . 93620_97460
*PAR0:	&-um but in playtime in the middle of the day . 97980_99780
*PAR0:	we typically don't have books out there in his bedroom . 99780_102220
*PAR0:	so and we're not in his bedroom a lot during the day . 102220_104500
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah so mostly at bedtime is when we do books when he's more quiet and ready to f calm down . 105080_113540
*PAR0:	are there &-um any specific books that he likes . 113900_120480
*PAR0:	he likes Goodnight Moon that's why I thought he might like this one with the counting . 120480_123680
*PAR0:	but &-um but no he likes Goodnight Moon and we have what other ones do you like . 123680_130220
*PAR0:	we have a lot of the Dr Seuss books . 130220_131620
*PAR0:	like a lot of these like in this size . 131620_133860
*PAR0:	&-um I know if there's any one particular he really likes though . 133860_139140
*PAR0:	oh we like he likes &-um up to the moon . 139140_144320
*PAR0:	and yeah I was like it'll come to me . 144320_165140
*PAR0:	he likes guess how much I love you . 165140_166920
*PAR0:	&-um and those are probably the two that we read to him the most Goodnight Moon and guess how much I love you . 166920_170420
*PAR0:	he likes those a lot . 170500_171260
*PAR0:	and then we have these &-um Winnie the pooh . 171280_172800
*PAR0:	&-uh make sound like you slide them in and out . 172800_176840
*PAR0:	and like they've got like five different buttons . 176840_178720
*PAR0:	and you read along . 178720_179480
*PAR0:	and you hit the button . 179480_180280
*PAR0:	and it makes a sound or whatever . 180280_181800
*PAR0:	he likes those the sound effect ones . 181800_183560
*PAR0:	what'd you find are those some measuring spoons . 184200_188320
*PAR0:	so yeah those are probably the ones we read to him the most . 189720_192000
*PAR0:	the ones he reacts to because he doesn't really react a whole lot when we read you know he'll like try to eat the book like he'll try to grab it and chew on it . 192100_201220
*PAR0:	or he'll just sit and really quietly listen . 201220_203300
*PAR0:	but we don't get a whole . 203300_203960
*PAR0:	lot of reactions of you know different inflections in our voice when we read to him or like when very occasionally I'll put like a baby Einstein video on . 203960_213580
*PAR0:	and he typically doesn't even react to that . 213580_215300
*PAR0:	he'll sit and watch it . 215300_216360
*PAR0:	and you can tell he's like intrigued like . 216360_218380
*PAR0:	huh what is all this . 218380_219480
*PAR0:	you know . 219480_219700
*PAR0:	but he doesn't really like laugh at the screen or doesn't really smile . 219700_225220
*PAR0:	he just kind of sits there . 225220_226220
*PAR0:	so I don't put him in front of it a whole lot because I don't really want to put him in front of the tv a whole bunch . 226220_230480
*PAR0:	but &-um sometimes I have to just &-uh just &-uh calm him down when he gets a little too worked up . 230480_235600
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah so we typically don't get a whole lot of reaction out of him just yet as to what the story is about or . 236000_242260
*PAR0:	oh look there's a bunny or anything . 242260_243760
*PAR0:	he doesn't really get that yet . 243780_245600
*PAR0:	I don't think . 245600_246260
*PAR0:	okay . 247360_247820
*PAR0:	&-uh what about the foods today is [/] is there anything that &-um what you think is familiar . 248380_253660
*PAR0:	just based on what &-um he sees at home . 253660_256300
*PAR0:	what you have at home or &-um no probably more just the texture . 256300_261860
*PAR0:	he's [/] he's really a texture baby . 262400_264500
*PAR0:	he likes to feel things . 264600_266740
*PAR0:	and he likes to explore with his hands and his mouth . 266740_269500
*PAR0:	&-um which I think is pretty normal . 269500_270960
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah I mean we have these things at home . 271620_274580
*PAR0:	but we don't eat it at the same time . 274920_276740
*PAR0:	he does because he's not in f doing finger foods really well yet . 276740_279780
*PAR0:	so we typically feed him first . 279940_281480
*PAR0:	and then we eat . 281480_282260
*PAR0:	and he plays while we eat . 282260_283480
*PAR0:	&-um so he . 283960_285440
*PAR0:	wouldn't really have that much exposure per say to what we're eating because he's not really paying attention to what we're having . 285440_291280
*PAR0:	but like there are foods that he eats that I was talking about like peas and the pears . 291280_296740
*PAR0:	&-um he's not ha well I guess he's kind of had spaghetti I guess in a jar . 296740_301680
*PAR0:	&-um when I talked about you know like the utensils like the spoon and the plates . 301680_307020
*PAR0:	and you know things like that . 307040_308260
*PAR0:	when I'm feeding him that I talked to him about like you know let's you know this is a spoon you know you feed yourself with a spoon and things like that . 308260_315020
*PAR0:	&-um so I think in that regard it might be familiar of just kind of words and terms that I've used with him but probably not recognition from looking at it . 315020_323840
*PAR0:	you know what I'm saying . 323840_324500
*PAR0:	I think . 326820_327140
*PAR0:	yeah that'd probably be . 327140_328020
*PAR0:	yeah . 328020_330340
*PAR0:	so how did you play with him with &-uh food . 331280_334780
*PAR0:	&-um I typically when I play with him at home he's very curious . 335240_339460
*PAR0:	he's like his father . 339940_340680
*PAR0:	he's very analytical . 340800_341360
*PAR0:	my [/] my husband's an engineer . 341700_343140
*PAR0:	so he's very analytical . 343140_344660
*PAR0:	and he's very quiet . 344660_345580
*PAR0:	so when he plays he's typically plays pretty quietly . 345580_348200
*PAR0:	&-um so I like to point things out to him and tell him what things are . 348200_352420
*PAR0:	&-um so like when he would pick up the spoon I'd say . 352420_355120
*PAR0:	oh it's a purple spoon . 355120_356200
*PAR0:	you know we eat with a spoon or he'd pick up the key and be like . 356200_359000
*PAR0:	oh that's a blue key we unlock doors and start cars . 359000_361620
*PAR0:	and I kind of tell him what they are . 361620_363060
*PAR0:	and I &-uh point out like colors or shapes like as he's playing like you know what I'm saying . 363060_369140
*PAR0:	like &-uh yeah . 369140_370460
*PAR0:	so as opposed to like and I you know like I tried like . 370460_373740
*PAR0:	okay . 373740_373920
*PAR0:	we take the bottle . 373920_374480
*PAR0:	and we feed the baby . 374480_375280
*PAR0:	he's breastfed . 375280_375860
*PAR0:	so he's like . 375860_376460
*PAR0:	what's a bottle you know . 376460_377840
*PAR0:	so I'm like this is what we do with the bottle . 377840_379420
*PAR0:	and he's like . 379420_380040
*PAR0:	yeah whatever . 380040_380400
*PAR0:	let me have the bottle . 380400_382180
*PAR0:	&-um yeah so I kind of more like describe what he's playing with as he's playing and at home a lot of times you know he like bangs them together . 382180_389900
*PAR0:	or &-um we have more like interactive toys at home . 389900_393860
*PAR0:	like &-um his favorite toy lately is &-um this giraffe thing that like stands like this . 393860_400080
*PAR0:	and there's balls that you put . 400080_401620
*PAR0:	there's like three holes giraffe . 401900_402860
*PAR0:	and you put the ball in the hole . 402860_404060
*PAR0:	so he's finally figured out how to put the ball in the hole . 404060_406860
*PAR0:	and then it comes out the other end . 406860_408160
*PAR0:	makes a sound . 408160_408980
*PAR0:	and he loves that . 408980_409960
*PAR0:	so he's like . 409960_410320
*PAR0:	oh like so he's finally caught on to . 410320_412740
*PAR0:	oh when I put the ball in the hole this is a reaction that happens . 412740_415320
*PAR0:	and it comes out this way or this way . 415320_417280
*PAR0:	and where's it gonna go . 417280_418440
*PAR0:	and so he really likes that one right now . 418440_420660
*PAR0:	&-um he's got a bunch of new toys for Christmas so we're slowly introducing them . 420660_425060
*PAR0:	so as not to . 425060_426220
*PAR0:	so he actually learns how to play with them . 426220_428320
*PAR0:	and not just like . 428320_428880
*PAR0:	oh my god there's toys everywhere . 428880_429800
*PAR0:	so [/] so yeah so at home he really just kind of he's I I'm a very lucky mom because he's really a very easy baby and entertains himself very easily . 430180_440420
*PAR0:	so I play with him at home . 440560_441840
*PAR0:	it's really just kind of more of watching him play . 441840_444160
*PAR0:	and . 444160_445100
*PAR0:	like I said like describing what he's playing with . 445100_447800
*PAR0:	and . 447800_448020
*PAR0:	oh can you pick up the yellow ball and that kind of thing . 448020_450580
*PAR0:	so trying to get him to he obviously doesn't yet understand colors or anything just yet . 450580_455660
*PAR0:	but I'm hoping by doing that [/] that he'll pick up on them sooner rather than you know later down the line . 455660_461420
*PAR0:	so don't answer your question . 461420_464840
*PAR0:	yeah . 466020_466260
*PAR0:	&-um did &-um you guys play with that or how did he . 471540_479040
*PAR0:	I ch I tried to play with him like with a puppet . 479700_482180
*PAR0:	&-um like trying to like because sometimes I'll take his stuffed animals at home . 482560_486320
*PAR0:	and like give him kisses or tickle him on the belly . 486320_488220
*PAR0:	but he was so preoccupied with [/] with this stuff that he like wasn't even paying attention like I'd try to tickle him . 488560_493840
*PAR0:	he's like . 493920_494300
*PAR0:	yeah whatever like not paying attention because he was like . 494300_496660
*PAR0:	oh this spoon [/] spoon tastes [/] tastes really good . 496660_497800
*PAR0:	so I'm sure Teething has something to do with that right now . 498020_501440
*PAR0:	that he's definitely more focused on n [/] n things in his mouth because there's a tooth trying to pop through . 501520_506500
*PAR0:	&-um but &-um but like I said we don't have a whole lot of stuffed animals out for him . 507040_511580
*PAR0:	&-um we have a dog at home . 512280_513620
*PAR0:	so the dog tries to eat them . 513760_515080
*PAR0:	so I have toto keep them . 515200_516580
*PAR0:	so [/] so she is out none of the stuffed animals can be out because she'll try to steal them and try to eat them . 516580_521160
*PAR0:	&-um so we only have a couple . 521880_523840
*PAR0:	and they're like little finger puppets that I'll play with them sometimes or &-um here's . 523840_530060
*PAR0:	a couple of teddy bears in his room . 530060_531140
*PAR0:	but we don't play with those yet . 531140_532220
*PAR0:	he's still a little too little for those . 532300_533520
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah so with these I like just tried to like put a couple of them in front of him and tell him what they were . 533820_538700
*PAR0:	and he'd pick it up and put it in his mouth . 538700_540920
*PAR0:	and put it down and move back to something hard . 540920_542440
*PAR0:	so that's kind of how he was with those today . 542860_545300
*PAR0:	I think he just wanted the hard texture for his gums today . 545460_548120
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah [/] yeah he's not really too into the stuffed animal thing . 548760_553540
*PAR0:	even at home there . 554340_556420
*PAR0:	&-um animal names that you think are familiar . 556420_561260
*PAR0:	let's say &-um dog definitely like when we were I can't remember if I said it out loud . 561260_565780
*PAR0:	but when I had the pink poodle I was I had the pink poodle out . 565780_568440
*PAR0:	I pulled that one out because it was a dog . 568760_570400
*PAR0:	I didn't see this one until just now . 570440_571440
*PAR0:	&-um because we have a big dog at home . 571900_573620
*PAR0:	I think he recognizes the word dog and puppy . 573740_576780
*PAR0:	&-um because we use those at home quite a bit . 576780_579120
*PAR0:	and &-um so I think he recognizes those . 579360_582140
*PAR0:	but as far as other animals I don't think he recognizes any other because it's not repetitive like we don't . 582240_588300
*PAR0:	we aren't around a whole lot of other animals other than our dog . 588300_590940
*PAR0:	yeah ones that are &-uh really unfamiliar that you maybe haven't gone over or &-um just now kind of you know some more extended animals . 591320_601140
*PAR0:	yeah we probably haven't ever mentioned the word deer . 601140_603940
*PAR0:	I'm trying to think of things we wouldn't talk about . 604400_606420
*PAR0:	at home or rooster . 606420_607520
*PAR0:	hmm zebra . 609100_611020
*PAR0:	we've talked about some of the things like're in his books or like on his toys I've mentioned . 611020_614260
*PAR0:	but like roosters definitely not one is this a beaver . 614260_617760
*PAR0:	yeah we haven't talked about beavers . 617760_619000
*PAR0:	&-um yeah because like I said like when I'm when we're reading books or playing with toys I'm [/] I'm always like descriptive of . 619000_628640
*PAR0:	oh look it's a orange lion or it's a look it's a black and white zebra things like that . 628640_634680
*PAR0:	but I don't think any of those types of animals like the rooster the deer or the beaver are like in any of the books or toys that we play with at home . 634680_642280
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 642280_645380
*PAR0:	no . 645380_645580
*PAR0:	do you [/] you find [/] find when [/] when you're [/] you're going [/] going over [/] over because [/] because you [/] you said [/] said that [/] that you [/] you always [/] always go [/] go through [/] through like [/] like color [/] color states shape even [/] even counting [/] counting . 645580_651440
*PAR0:	do [/] do you find that you tend to &-um with the counting stay like at a lower number or have you been counting up . 651440_657560
*PAR0:	&-uh no typically I stay at a lower number just because of what what's in front of him typically or what's in the book . 657560_662740
*PAR0:	yeah I'd say five and under right now just from what because what he what his options are . 662740_668060
*PAR0:	I'll say . 668060_668740
*PAR0:	oh look there's one two three balls or you know look the these blocks that we have four blocks . 668740_673780
*PAR0:	&-um I may have gone up to ten . 673780_676360
*PAR0:	we just got him a set of &-um blocks . 676360_678300
*PAR0:	and there are ten of them in the set . 678300_680200
*PAR0:	so I may at one point or another have counted the blocks up to ten . 680200_683760
*PAR0:	but probably not probably . 683760_685400
*PAR0:	Alec Fiefenbender is probably all . 685400_687980
*PAR0:	we've all I've consciously that I can think of off the top of my head done at home . 688420_692000
*PAR0:	mm . 692120_692320
*PAR0:	so smaller numbers . 692480_693280
*PAR0:	yeah probably . 693280_693780
*PAR0:	and how do you &-um how do you usually get his attention . 694900_697860
*PAR0:	like if he's [/] he's playing with one thing . 698020_700140
*PAR0:	for example today he's playing with [/] with one thing . 700140_703040
*PAR0:	and then you kinda wanna bring his attention to something else . 703040_705540
*PAR0:	how do [/] do you . 705560_705820
*PAR0:	generally &-um I would put it in front of him . 705820_707800
*PAR0:	and &-um say . 707800_709100
*PAR0:	look Aiden it's a I try to say his name . 709100_710960
*PAR0:	look Aiden it's a you know this it's a pink poodle or &-um like <I'd try> [/] I'd try to put it in front of his face like this . 711040_718280
*PAR0:	but I tried to put this book . 718380_719280
*PAR0:	he was playing with one of the one of these . 719280_721120
*PAR0:	and I tried to put it in front of his face and started reading it to him . 721280_723760
*PAR0:	and then would you know'd say Peekaboo and he'd look up and then I'd okay . 724140_727720
*PAR0:	and then you know turn the page or whatever . 727720_729300
*PAR0:	&-um is that a game that you play at home Peekaboo yeah that's one of his favorites . 729300_735180
*PAR0:	we play Peekaboo a lot . 735260_736280
*PAR0:	so the inflection usually gets him to what like gets him to perk up . 736440_740320
*PAR0:	&-um but normally even at home he &-um he just re &-um replies to his name like if I say Aiden you know and he'll [/] he'll typically look at me like . 740860_748980
*PAR0:	where'd she go . 748980_749580
*PAR0:	you know where is she . 749580_750620
*PAR0:	&-um sometimes I'll have to repeat it . 750620_752740
*PAR0:	if he's really paying attention to something I'll have to say it once or twice &-um just to get his attention . 752740_757680
*PAR0:	but yeah typically just . 757680_758300
*PAR0:	saying his name gets his attention . 758300_760440
*PAR0:	if [/] if I if I'm not really close to him to be able just to put it in front of him and say . 760440_764060
*PAR0:	look you know look Aiden it's this &-um . 764060_766880
*PAR0:	oh what did you find . 766880_768920
*PAR0:	what did you find in the clock . 768920_771260
*PAR0:	see . 771260_774420
*PAR0:	chewing really want the butts not chew on them . 774420_778280
*PAR0:	that's full . 778280_779080
*PAR0:	you leave teeth marks on it . 779080_780680
*PAR0:	think it already has &-um quite a few . 781660_784080
*PAR0:	I'll have to clean it but can't get it out . 784240_787220
*PAR0:	is it ice cream . 787820_788840
*PAR0:	it's one of mommy's favorites . 789680_791140
*PAR0:	has he had that yet ice cream . 792280_794620
*PAR0:	mm . 795040_795220
*PAR0:	mm no . 795220_796160
*PAR0:	he has not &-um can't have dairy until after a year . 796160_798400
*PAR0:	oh &-um no [/] no ice cream . 798680_801240
*PAR0:	but we have ice cream in the house a lot but not typically in coats . 801280_804180
*PAR0:	see . 804940_805720
*PAR0:	yeah . 805720_805860
*PAR0:	mommy and daddy eat a lot of ice cream . 805860_807000
*PAR0:	don't we maybe not so much this year because we need to lose some weight but trying to lose twenty pounds . 807000_813020
*PAR0:	the both of us are so . 813020_813960
*PAR0:	oh good luck . 814200_815200
*PAR0:	yeah thank you . 815280_815840
*PAR0:	yeah . 815920_816000
*PAR0:	we're gonna need it . 816000_816560
*PAR0:	so no willpower when it comes to food I don't maybe once you start walking yeah chasing after it a little bit more . 816640_823540
*PAR0:	yeah . 823540_824680
*PAR0:	keep me on my toes huh . 824680_826920
*PAR0:	okay . 826920_827980
*PAR0:	is there anything else about the session that you wanted to share . 827980_830720
*PAR0:	&-um that might be different or the same from home or different from last time . 830720_838280
*PAR0:	the I think just the big difference is that these I think the ones he went for the most are like [/] like the play pretend toys you know like where it's . 838280_849360
*PAR0:	okay . 849360_849540
*PAR0:	we build a sandwich with this or . 849540_851220
*PAR0:	&-um you know oh we pretend to eat this . 851220_853580
*PAR0:	and we he doesn't do that at home . 853580_854900
*PAR0:	obviously <I don't> [/] I don't think he's really to that point yet . 854900_856780
*PAR0:	&-um because he's more like I said into the more of the interactive I do something with this . 856780_861420
*PAR0:	I take the hammer . 861480_862140
*PAR0:	and I pound on this . 862140_863220
*PAR0:	or I put the ball in the hole . 863420_865200
*PAR0:	or you know like those kind of things where it's more and more sound . 865200_869520
*PAR0:	he's lots of his toys make a lot of sound and music . 869800_872460
*PAR0:	and he hits a button . 872460_874440
*PAR0:	and you know something happens . 874440_875760
*PAR0:	some sound or song [/] song plays . 875800_877540
*PAR0:	&-um so it's very different in that regard that it's this was very quiet play where at home he is quiet while he plays with noisy toys . 877540_883840
*PAR0:	does that make sense . 884240_885280
*PAR0:	yeah . 885340_885520
*PAR0:	so yeah that would probably that's probably the biggest difference between these [/] these toys . 885860_889800
*PAR0:	like how he played here how he plays at home . 889800_891620
*PAR0:	so I think here he was really just exploring &-um &-um the different textures of the toys as he was putting them in his mouth . 892100_900040
*PAR0:	he like he I he played with the spaghetti for quite a bit I think because it had a different kind of texture on the top &-um than the spoons or the plates or the bottle . 900220_909660
*PAR0:	&-um he played with this for quite a while . 910080_911340
*PAR0:	I think he was just kind of exploring like he had it in his hands . 911400_913960
*PAR0:	and then he had it in his [/] his mouth . 914040_915140
*PAR0:	mouth like . 915140_915480
*PAR0:	oh this feels different . 915480_916460
*PAR0:	it's not smooth because this is all bumpy . 916460_918620
*PAR0:	and things see is that the spaghetti . 918620_920540
*PAR0:	so that's probably the only other thing . 920540_923280
*PAR0:	I could think of because just that's the big difference between home . 923280_926460
*PAR0:	and here last time he did the exact same thing . 926460_929160
*PAR0:	I what he went for the exact same toys . 929160_931720
*PAR0:	&-um I don't remember specifically if he went for the spaghetti . 931720_934700
*PAR0:	but he went for all the hard toys . 934700_936080
*PAR0:	the spoons and the plates and the pizza . 936180_937720
*PAR0:	those kind of things where he wanted to put it in his mouth . 938020_941280
*PAR0:	it's great . 942920_943680
*PAR0:	great . 944160_945100
*PAR0:	thank you so much . 945520_946380
*PAR0:	hey no problem . 946440_946740
*PAR0:	you answered everything really perfectly . 946760_948340
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh not that there's a right or wrong answer . 949540_951800
*PAR0:	you know . 952080_953100
*PAR0:	so I guess from here we want to do the third session . 953100_958680
*PAR0:	right . 958680_959140
*PAR0:	and he's just let's see . 959140_961880
*PAR0:	I'm gonna stop the recording . 961880_963200
