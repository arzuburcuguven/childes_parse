@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	28-AUG-1995
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	it's all set .
@Comment:	Time is 16:49. Magnets are set up on a table; Mot and Chi are seated across from one another at the table; black base is full of objects; at the outset of the activity Mot has the horseshoe magnet and Chi has the yellow wand
@Comment:	MOT and Chi work well together; Chi primarily plays with the objects; Mot joins in occasionally and gives suggestions which Chi follows; science talk is limited to a few isolated exchanges about whether or not particular items stick
*CHI:	goody .
*INV:	and you can play for about ten minutes .
*MOT:	(..) that's [= referent unclear] pretty cool huh Chi ?
*MOT:	(.) &=laughs [>] .
*CHI:	&=laughs [<] .
*CHI:	look .
%act:	points to black base
*CHI:	+^ that guy's [= silver man on base] doin(g) a +...
*MOT:	yeah .
*MOT:	wanna try this one [= horseshoe magnet] ?
%act:	offers horseshoe magnet to Chi
*MOT:	this one [= horseshoe magnet] doesn't move (th)em .
*MOT:	yours [= yellow wand] is stronger .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	holds yellow wand over a silver man on the black base; it causes the silver man to stand up on the base
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	there you go .
*CHI:	keep doing like that .
*CHI:	hm: .
*CHI:	oh .
*MOT:	that guy disconnected to you .
*MOT:	(..) pretty neat .
*MOT:	xxx &=mumbles .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	holds yellow wand over black base again; yellow wand sticks to base
*CHI:	oh no .
*CHI:	strong .
