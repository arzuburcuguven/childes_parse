*MOT:	magnetized stuff !
@Comment:	Time is 18:32. MOT and Chi are difficult to hear most of the time; they whisper to one another and there is a tv set playing in the background , which makes it difficult to hear their voices. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio. MOT and Chi work well together; although there is not always much talk , they seem to communicate silently. On several occasions Mot silently models the way in which magnets work and Chi imitates. There is a fair amount of talk about the magnets and how they work. Mot directs most of the play.
