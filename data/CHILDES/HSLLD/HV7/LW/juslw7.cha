*INV:	Chi .
@Comment:	Chi is very reluctant to write and writes very little. Mot makes dinner in another room while Chi writes his letter. Chi asks EXP a few times about what he's supposed to write about. Chi remarks that he is being sloppy , but his (cursive) writing is quite legible. After Chi completes the letter , MOT re-enters and criticizes Chi for the shortness of the letter. Chi ignores her , saying that he wrote to Eric Carle at HV5. (he didn't) Signing name and giving address were EXP's idea.
