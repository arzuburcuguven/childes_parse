<p>In accordance with TalkBank rules, any use of data from this corpus
must be accompanied by at least one of the above references.

<h3>Corpus Description</h3>
This corpus consists of transcripts and audio-recordings of naturalistic interactions involving 47 full-term infants (24 girls and 23 boys) in Edinburgh, UK. Participating families were asked to record 90 minutes' worth of daily interactions with the target infant when they were 9, 15 and 21 months old. The number and length of individual
sessions varied. The data currently available cover the 9- and 15-month sessions (60 minutes' worth for each per child). Of the 47 families, 24 consented to releasing the audio-recordings, which are linked to the corresponding transcripts.

<h3>Associated Data</h3>
As part of the project, CDI data were also collected for all 47 children
at 9, 15 and 21 months of age. These are available at <a
href="https://osf.io/scfxn/?view_only=1e924f79c6734a30bb84cc108a969f08">
the project's OSF site</a>.

<h3>File Naming Conventions</h3>
Each file name consists of the child's pseudonym + month of recording +
session number (e.g., adam0901.cha is the first recording session for
Adam when he was 9 months old).

<h3>Warnings</h3>
Phonological transcription of unidentifiable materials using '&~' was
done impressionistically and has not been systematically checked for accuracy or
consistency. Where there is some overlap between two or more utterances,
the sound bullets start at the onset of the first utterance and end at
the offset of the last overlapping utterance (marked by '+<'). To
facilitate MOR parsing and cross-dialectal comparison, American, instead of British, spelling has been used throughout, except for the word <i>Mummy</i>. The %more and %gra tiers were generated by MOR, POST and MEGRASP, and have not been hand-corrected.

<h3>Codes</h3>
The following unique codes are used:
<ul>
  <li>[+ NAC]: Utterance not addressed at the target child.</li>
  <li>[+ RDG]: Book reading.</li>
  <li>[+ RHY]: (Unsung) rhyme (e.g., "This little piggy").</li>
  <li>[+ SNG]: Song. Note that this is used in addition to [=! singing],
  which can be any form of singing (cf. "Let's have breakfast [=!
  singing]." vs. "Baa baa black sheep have you any wool [=! singing]? [+
  SNG]")</li>
</ul>
Researchers interested in looking only at infant/child-directed speech, for example, can exclude utterances with [+ NAC] in their analysis.
