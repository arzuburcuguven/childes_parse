*PAR0:	I noticed huh . 48020_49340
*PAR0:	&-uh why would you say she wasn't interested in it . 50260_54580
*PAR0:	I was thinking about it . 54960_56500
*PAR0:	she doesn't really have baby dolls at home . 56560_58280
*PAR0:	she has stuffed animals but not baby dolls . 58340_61740
*PAR0:	and obviously she's the baby in our family . 61740_64420
*PAR0:	so &-um do you think there were any changes since the last visit . 64420_71060
*PAR0:	or do you remember back . 71060_72740
*PAR0:	then . 72740_72940
*PAR0:	I don't remember . 73280_74380
*PAR0:	I mean she's [/] she's definitely grown since then and is [/] is more developmentally mature I guess . 74520_87620
*PAR0:	but I don't remember exactly what difference is . 87620_89900
*PAR0:	okay . 90060_90140
*PAR0:	&-um do you &-uh do you have any of the books we have at home &-uh here at home . 90360_101500
*PAR0:	no [/] no we have books by the same authors . 101500_104020
*PAR0:	you know similar books . 104020_105100
*PAR0:	but we don't have these exact books . 105100_106600
*PAR0:	oh okay . 106660_107000
*PAR0:	so you say she's more into books &-uh toys . 107600_110580
*PAR0:	she loves books . 110940_112720
*PAR0:	she loves toys too . 112880_114140
*PAR0:	&-uh huh &-um I think she's [/] she's probably accustomed to different toys . 114660_120040
*PAR0:	yeah . 120520_120600
*PAR0:	from what's here . 120700_121380
*PAR0:	so the books might be more . 121480_122540
*PAR0:	familiar . 122540_123120
*PAR0:	&-uh yeah if that makes sense . 123620_125120
*PAR0:	yeah . 125140_125240
*PAR0:	like &-um do you think she'd recognize any of the foods we have . 125300_131880
*PAR0:	mm no [/] no [/] no not yet . 132960_137700
*PAR0:	yeah maybe the peas but she might not recognize them like that . 137700_142800
*PAR0:	but if they were like individual peas I'm sure she would try to eat at our house . 142800_165560
*PAR0:	and she gets very excited about dogs . 165560_169040
*PAR0:	so I but again they're they don't look like in any of the stuffed animals here . 169040_177400
*PAR0:	you know what I mean . 177400_178120
*PAR0:	like she definitely knows dog . 178120_179620
*PAR0:	she says dog when she sees them . 179620_181580
*PAR0:	and [/] and &-um she feeds them from her high chair very happily . 181580_185620
*PAR0:	and she calls them . 185620_186580
*PAR0:	and then they come . 186580_187680
*PAR0:	and she feeds them . 187680_188500
*PAR0:	but [/] but I think her conception of what a dog is [/] is so different from the stuffed chihuahua . 188500_196660
*PAR0:	I don't know if she makes the connection . 196660_198640
*PAR0:	okay . 198640_199520
*PAR0:	&-um what about do you have any pretend food at home . 199520_204100
*PAR0:	we do <we have> [/] we have a picnic basket . 204100_207880
*PAR0:	it's plush . 207880_208840
*PAR0:	it's not plastic like this . 208840_210240
*PAR0:	but [/] but she plays with that a lot . 210240_212700
*PAR0:	okay . 212720_213040
*PAR0:	&-um I think you were reading one of our Peekaboo books or yes . 214020_217200
*PAR0:	do you play Peekaboo at home . 217380_218720
*PAR0:	we play Peekaboo at home . 218760_220560
*PAR0:	okay . 221640_221680
*PAR0:	okay . 222680_223500
*PAR0:	&-um think that's it . 223960_225840
*PAR0:	unless is there anything else you wanna tell us about how she plays at home or her toys or anything . 225900_230420
*PAR0:	she you know she's a very good little player . 230580_233560
*PAR0:	if she wakes up early in the morning I can get up and feed her . 233560_237940
*PAR0:	and then just put her right back in her crib . 237940_239580
*PAR0:	and she'll just play with a few toys happily for like an hour . 239580_242820
*PAR0:	it's [/] it's amazing . 242820_244760
*PAR0:	so she's [/] she's very accustomed to just playing with a few toys and being happy by yourself . 244760_250140
*PAR0:	okay . 250380_250680
*PAR0:	I don't know if that's yeah it's fine . 251220_253420
*PAR0:	interesting to you . 253560_254540
*PAR0:	but . 254540_254800
*PAR0:	okay . 255500_255900
*PAR0:	I think we're all done . 256300_257600
*PAR0:	&-um this is interesting that she likes the keys because she's obsessed with my keys . 257800_262100
*PAR0:	oh really . 262340_262620
*PAR0:	so I wonder if she thinks that they're similar . 262640_265040
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 265440_266000
*PAR0:	okay . 266980_267320
