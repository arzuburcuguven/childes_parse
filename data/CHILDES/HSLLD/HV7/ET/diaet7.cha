*INV:	what we would like you guys to do is try to just (.) play with this stuff for a while .
@Comment:	Time is 13:58
@Comment:	The mood here is friendly , but not very interactive. Chi works almost entirely on her own , with comments and support from Mot. Mot does not play with the magnets much. EXP remains in the background , mostly answering questions directed to her. For the most part , Chi spends the time stacking things on the black base. She is intrigued , however , by the plastic objects which do not stick and wonders repeatedly what their purpose is here. Mot initiates brief scientific talk , asking Chi if she knows what the base is. Both appear to be satisfied by the answer , given by Mot , that it's a magnet. Video does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
