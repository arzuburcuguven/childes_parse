*PAR0:	mhm . 0_460
*PAR0:	mhm . 1280_1840
*PAR0:	is it . 2140_2800
*PAR0:	okay . 2800_2980
*PAR0:	if I ask you some questions . 2980_4000
*PAR0:	sure . 4040_4200
*PAR0:	okay . 4940_5100
*PAR0:	can't you just keep playing . 5460_6320
*PAR0:	is that . 6320_6560
*PAR0:	no . 6980_7180
*PAR0:	yeah absolutely . 7180_7640
*PAR0:	okay . 7640_7780
*PAR0:	mhm . 8520_8600
*PAR0:	yeah . 8600_9060
*PAR0:	&-um I didn't wonder if you had any other good stories like . 9720_12640
*PAR0:	yeah . 12800_13120
*PAR0:	mhm . 13560_13900
*PAR0:	&-um so did you notice &-um any differences like . 14080_18520
*PAR0:	what do you remember what you liked a lot <last time> [/] last time I'm pretty sure that both she and her sister didn't really show a strong preference for one category or another . 18520_28480
*PAR0:	they both gravitated kind of equally to the plastic food stuff and the plush toys and the books . 28480_36520
*PAR0:	&-um last time they showed no interest in the doll . 36520_38700
*PAR0:	and so it's a new thing for her to have shown interest in the doll . 38700_41420
*PAR0:	right . 41780_42000
*PAR0:	&-um and last time she went over to the stuffed animals . 42080_45600
*PAR0:	and this time she didn't go over at all to the stuffed animals . 45840_48340
*PAR0:	so &-um so it doesn't surprise me that the plastic food things were the first things she went to though because she's teething . 48760_56060
*PAR0:	and so it for her to grab something plastic and put it in her mouth . 56400_59820
*PAR0:	she's doing that all the time right now . 59820_61080
*PAR0:	so that doesn't surprise me at all . 61080_64000
*PAR0:	&-um do you think <so what> [/] so what would you say was her favorite things today . 64000_68420
*PAR0:	pizza [/] pizza . 68420_70140
*PAR0:	do you think it was &-um does she do you think she knows the name for that . 70140_75020
*PAR0:	no I don't yet . 75080_76240
*PAR0:	mm . 76340_76520
*PAR0:	mm . 76520_76660
*PAR0:	okay . 77000_77260
*PAR0:	&-um do you think there's a reason why she picked some of the plastic things and not others . 78740_85840
*PAR0:	I don't know I mean some of it maybe proximity she . 86480_91160
*PAR0:	went for the bread . 91160_91740
*PAR0:	first I just cause it was closest . 91740_93140
*PAR0:	and I think the pizza is has bright colors on it . 93280_96260
*PAR0:	and it was also close by . 96340_97380
*PAR0:	she didn't have toto work very hard for it . 97460_98800
*PAR0:	&-um but why the pizza and not the plate that was equally close . 98800_102160
*PAR0:	I don't know . 102160_102900
*PAR0:	okay . 103780_104100
*PAR0:	and she likes this ice cream cone too . 104400_106100
*PAR0:	we have a toy at home . 106700_109480
*PAR0:	that's the same shape as that ice cream cone that she puts in her mouth all the time . 109480_112400
*PAR0:	so that may be a familiar shape to her . 112680_115160
*PAR0:	okay . 115680_116040
*PAR0:	and then &-um do you think [/] think she knows the names of any of the foods there . 116800_123440
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 123740_124800
*PAR0:	no we're just starting solid foods . 125520_129780
*PAR0:	&-um so I don't even know that she would associate bread with the bread that I give her . 130320_135420
*PAR0:	that's all cut up into little pieces . 135420_136800
*PAR0:	it doesn't look the same . 136920_137620
*PAR0:	so I don't even know she would associate it . 137620_140700
*PAR0:	do you play with play food at home . 140700_143880
*PAR0:	we don't play with play food . 143880_145080
*PAR0:	no we don't have any play food . 145080_147840
*PAR0:	okay . 147840_148340
*PAR0:	how about the books . 148340_150200
*PAR0:	did she enjoy the books . 150200_152420
*PAR0:	&-um she spent a little bit of time with the books but not [/] not as much as last time . 152420_157240
*PAR0:	I don't think &-um we [/] we read every day at home have lots of books . 157240_162640
*PAR0:	so she's familiar with books . 162640_164100
*PAR0:	&-um but &-uh we [/] we try not to let them chew on the books . 164360_169460
*PAR0:	and I think when she wants to chew on something like she does all the time . 169580_172720
*PAR0:	now then the plastic stuff is kinda what [/] what she goes for . 172720_175420
*PAR0:	okay . 175420_176300
*PAR0:	do you have any of these books or . 176300_178100
*PAR0:	similar . 178100_178440
*PAR0:	we do we have the regular good night moon . 178440_180640
*PAR0:	this is a different version of good night moon . 180640_182480
*PAR0:	but we have a regular one . 182480_183540
*PAR0:	&-um and then we have this Peekababy book the Karen Katz ones with the things that lift up . 183540_188540
*PAR0:	we've got several of those books . 188540_189780
*PAR0:	okay . 189920_189980
*PAR0:	and do you play Peekaboo with at home . 190520_193860
*PAR0:	we do a little bit . 193860_194900
*PAR0:	yeah . 194900_195800
*PAR0:	does she have stuffed animals at home . 195800_201080
*PAR0:	yes . 201080_202080
*PAR0:	and she is playing with . 202080_203180
*PAR0:	mhm . 203180_203400
*PAR0:	yep . 203400_204920
*PAR0:	do you think she's familiar with any of like the names from the names of the animals . 204920_211480
*PAR0:	yeah we have we stuffed animals of a lot of different animals at home . 211480_215680
*PAR0:	and I do call <the duck> [/] the duck and call <the bird> [/] the bird and <the cow> [/] the cow and all of that . 215680_220840
*PAR0:	but I don't think she really is distinguishing between them yet . 220840_226080
*PAR0:	okay . 226080_227600
*PAR0:	and with the what kinds of things do you have a baby doll at home we don't have a baby doll at home . 227600_233720
*PAR0:	no her we don't have dolls . 233720_236560
*PAR0:	we've got mostly stuffed animals . 236560_237800
*PAR0:	okay . 238300_238340
*PAR0:	so what kinds of things was she doing today . 238980_240880
*PAR0:	you mentioned she played with the doll . 240980_242660
*PAR0:	yeah well at first she started climbing on it . 242740_244760
*PAR0:	&-um which since she's a twin she climbs on her sister like that all the time . 245540_250480
*PAR0:	and &-uh and so when she started showing interest in it that's when I picked the doll up so [/] so that she could kind of see look you know this is shaped like you shaped like your sister . 250480_259500
*PAR0:	&-um and she kinda lost [/] lost interest in it a little bit . 260520_263100
*PAR0:	but &-um she stayed close to it . 263240_266120
*PAR0:	so I [/] I don't know that was different than last time . 266200_268640
*PAR0:	it's interesting . 268640_269380
*PAR0:	and with the &-um . 270260_272640
*PAR0:	how did you play with . 272640_274200
*PAR0:	did you try to get her to like play with you or play with you and a particular toy or other . 274200_279680
*PAR0:	I mean was it in the same way that you kinda tried to attract her to the doll . 279680_283920
*PAR0:	yeah I don't think so . 283960_285080
*PAR0:	&-um I know last time she was when she was sh doing like this and holding the book up . 285400_290740
*PAR0:	I picked her up and read [/] read part of the story with her . 290740_293300
*PAR0:	&-um and this time she wasn't showing as much in as much sh sustained interest in one particular book . 293300_299700
*PAR0:	so I didn't do that . 299700_300560
*PAR0:	&-um I was curious to s myself to see what she would choose on her own . 300880_307460
*PAR0:	so I was trying <not to> [/] not to guide her too much . 307460_310840
*PAR0:	is there a difference . 310840_313900
*PAR0:	and I know there's going be one main difference . 313900_316300
*PAR0:	but is there a difference between &-um how you play here today and at home . 316300_322320
*PAR0:	the main difference being there's only one child here . 322320_327140
*PAR0:	and at home we've got two at home . 327140_332280
*PAR0:	there are things with this child that I'm working on . 332280_336060
*PAR0:	she's not sitting well on her own yet . 336060_338060
*PAR0:	she never gets into a seated position on her own . 338060_340360
*PAR0:	and at home I'm I think more physical with her than I was here and try and putting her in that seated position and giving her a toy to play with or reading a book together or doing something to work on those developmental things that I think she may be a little bit behind on . 340360_351880
*PAR0:	and I didn't do that as much here . 351880_353800
*PAR0:	how do you . 353800_356980
*PAR0:	and then at home . 356980_357840
*PAR0:	so you're playing with the two of them . 357840_359740
*PAR0:	how do you usually play . 359740_360660
*PAR0:	do you play with them or kind of do or you're interested to see what they're like kind of discovering on their own some of each . 360660_368740
*PAR0:	yeah . 368740_369120
*PAR0:	and you know a lot of times if [/] if we're in the same room but one baby is on the other side of the room . 369120_373360
*PAR0:	it gives me an opportunity to kind of watch her and play with &-um the other child at the same time . 373360_378480
*PAR0:	and [/] and see so it's [/] it's a little of both . 378480_380620
*PAR0:	how do you what are your favorite [/] favorite things to do . 380840_383040
*PAR0:	like play <when you> [/] when you can do . 383040_385380
*PAR0:	&-um <I like> [/] I like reading a lot . 385380_389000
*PAR0:	we do that every day . 389000_389960
*PAR0:	&-um I get up and dance a lot . 389960_391760
*PAR0:	we [/] we have a lot of music going in the house . 391760_393860
*PAR0:	and so <we do> [/] we do a lot of physical movement . 393860_397380
*PAR0:	&-um little toddler songs row [/] row [/] row your boat . 397380_399880
*PAR0:	you know stuff [/] stuff like that . 399880_401720
*PAR0:	&-um we do that at least as much as we play with &-um with plastic toys and stuffed animals and things like that . 401720_409280
*PAR0:	&-um but they have toys . 409800_411020
*PAR0:	and we set them up and play with them and make animal noises with the animals and things like that . 411020_416020
*PAR0:	okay . 416800_420360
*PAR0:	well I think that's it [/] it . 420680_422120
*PAR0:	okay . 422120_423340
*PAR0:	okay .
*PAR0:	think I's not in particular . 422480_427080
*PAR0:	okay . 427080_427920
*PAR0:	alright . 427920_428520
