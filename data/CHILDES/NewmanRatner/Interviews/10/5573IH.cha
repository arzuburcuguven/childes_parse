*PAR0:	do you think she would recognize the names of any of those items . 42540_45100
*PAR0:	&-um I think she probably you know we talk about peas . 45480_49320
*PAR0:	but &-um we ha it's m [/] m the majority of the pea sheets are mashed up . 49320_54380
*PAR0:	so she probably didn't recognize the shape . 54380_56160
