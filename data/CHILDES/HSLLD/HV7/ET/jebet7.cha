@Comment:	Time is 23:55
@Comment:	Chi and Mot work well together in this activity , with Chi starting and leading most of what they do. The mood is very playful , with a lot of joking around. Often Mot and Chi play independently , and often they play together. They discuss briefly and experiment with why coins don't stick to other magnets , why some pieces stick and others don't , repulsion , and attraction , but do not go into depth. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
*MOT:	okay .
*CHI:	oh &-um .
*CHI:	&-uh remember how I used a computer at this place ?
