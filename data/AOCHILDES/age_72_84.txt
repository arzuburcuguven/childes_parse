that night he had a stomachache
because why
its too much
the next day was sunday again
and he ate through a nice green leaf and after that he felt much better
now he wasnt hungry anymore and he wasnt little anymore
he was a big fat caterpillar
he built a small house called it a cocoon around himself
he stayed inside for more than two weeks
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and he pushed his way out
and guess what he turned into
a beautiful butterfly
were we talking about caterpillars
show inv your caterpillar
oh thats right that fuzzy one
we dont know if its a caterpillar or a gypsy moth
so if you pick it up and it bites its a gypsy moth
but we dont wanna
you woke him up
you wanna look at this book now
do you wanna read it to me
not real fast now
a little louder
what happened
i think i like that story better than the the words that
cute book
thats great
the pictures are nice
can you look at this one
you wanna read it
dont you wanna read it
or do you want me to read it
dont read so fast though
why dont you read it
a little louder
you want me to read it
start at the beginning
elephants are the largest animals
this baby looks little besides its mother
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds and it was three feet tall
were almost done
sit up and listen to the story
it was three feet tall
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside his mother
a baby elephant is called a calf
a mother elephant gives birth to one calf at a time
she will not give birth again until her calf is three years old
a baby elephant may drink mothers milk until it is four or five years old
it curls back its trunk when its feeding
theres two kinds of elephants asian and african
this is a female asian elephant
they are not as tall as african cousins
they have smaller ears and smaller tusks
the female called a cow has no tusks at all
this is an african elephant
male elephants are called bulls
did you know that
african elephants have a dip in their backs
they have ridges on their trunks which end in two points
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point
the elephants nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax
they live in holes in africa
they dont look much like elephants but their feet are like elephants feet only much smaller
are you listening
momma hasta
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow
this sea cow is called a manatee
sea cows are shy they never leave the water
their skin and teeth are like elephants
some sea cows have small tusks
its too long
youre not interested in the story
wanna read a little bit
can i finish this one
and then i can do this study
asian elephants live in forests and swamps
this cow lives in nepal a small country north of indian india
you can see her small ears and her small tusks
african elephants live in the plains as well as the forests
this african elephant lives in the open grassland
he flaps his big ears to help keep cool in the hot weather
elephants do not eat meat
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day
they use their trunks to reach high branches tear up plants and strip the bark off the trees
she read this book
is this the same book
bet you dont know what hes doing
you know what hes digging for
they use their tusks to dig for salt
and they dig holes in their dry rivers to find water
theres water over there
and if they dig deep down they can get a drink
come on
almost done
elephants drink a large amount of water
can you guess how many gallons a day he would drink
fifty gallons
they drink up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then they squirt the water down their throats
they bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies
look at them taking a bath
they love to take baths
theyre good swimmers they like to splash around in the water
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming elephants needta live water
a lot of water huh
theyre bothered by flies and bugs
they get rid of them by taking mud baths
this group of elephants looks red they look red because they have been rolling around in red mud
they live and travel in big groups called herds
the herd may be a few animals or a few hundred
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals
and they only charge when they are threatened
but elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months once a year
this is called being in musth
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth
i know
oh look
elephants are very smart animals
there are schools for asian elephants
they go to school
theyre taught to drag piles of logs and load them into the trucks
elephants carry people like the men with their bundles of grass
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work
i didnt know that
african elephants are not as easy to train
often they are killed for their ivory tusks even though this is against the law
elephants deserve better treatment than this
thats kind of sad huh
that they would kill them to take their tusks
that has a lot of words doesnt it
yeah i think
a leaf

there are a lot of people out there who dont like what youre doing and you have to tame it down
you gotta
you gotta do what we tell you
were trying to represent the people and were trying to tell you what the people out there want
now reagan wont listen if he wins too
too easily

run for it

its pretty slim
if he won

you bet he does
hes got some
we have to what mark

would you like to come and have some -uh snacks with us
were going to sit at the ta dinner table
come on you can come with us
would you like to have a seat here with us
what is back mean
i dont understand what that means
i see
is that from he man
or what whats that
oh i see
i dont know that
oh the empire strikes back
ill bet thats it
is that it
spidey spikes back
its the empire strikes back
it must have been
yeah well
you sawed saw an apple
mark would you like some beer
yeah some people eat fish
mark would you like a
would you like a cup of tea
how long
is mark always so talkative or is it just because hes for a guest -eh
-um we can give him a graham cracker and itll fill his mouth
would you like a graham cracker

like the empire strikes back
and thatll be eight after seven thats right
acceptable to me
that what
four more
thats right hell be nine
and then thatd be ten thats right you got it exactly
okay now
i got an idea mark
lets tell us about something else okay you can tell us stories about
tell kurt about what kind of music you like what kind of music you dance to
i dont believe that
what do you see on mtv
how high
is that cable
cable in denver they almost have it now
tell him

maybe you can tell him
he doesnt
eat it
whats the difference between

eat it
no video
or seen eat it
i heard it but then again havent see it
oh of them would have been better never heard on the radio
yes i agree
it on on video
no oh yes i did see thriller
thats the only one of them ive seen
i saw it in a hotel
did you like it
because hes because hes a monster
you know what i think that was mark
green slime mom

i dont know
he is flaky youre right
marky youre flaky
do you want some too
this way if you encourage him itll never stop
rein him in
yes thats right
you know thats not right
i think mark catches up on his verbal because ross talks all the time
and gets parents attention
and mark gets to catch up when -uh well when ross is not around
when ross passes out
his hair is so blonde
yeah mhm
huh more like moms than mine
heres a knife
it burns your mouth a lot

actually a little earlier mark we were down in the -uh garage we had just gotten home and mark said dia
i bird dia
he said “i ” and what he meant is “im im i i got frozen cold” dia
ross was talking about the bears up in carolot
who elses work is never done
who else
no do you know the saying is
a man he works from day to day
no ah from sun to sun isnt it
from sun to sun right
man he works from sun to sun
no that means when you wake up in the morning i go to work when im finished okay
but a womans work is never done
is that true
do women work harder than men
im stealing some of your mark
who works harder mommy or daddy
daddy works hard
how come
what makes you say that
what makes you say that i work hard
what is it that i do
all that stuff conferences what else
what else
you believe that is because daddy complains a lot
marky loves mommy best
you know we cant choose which one of you boys we love the best either
i cant choose which boy i love the best
i cant choose
sometimes i think i love marky the best
then sometimes i think i love rossy the best
its true ross theres times when i think i love marky the best
and thats just because youre not thinking about ross
thats because im not thinking about ross
then as soon as i think about ross then i think i love rossy the best
then i think about marky and i think i love marky the best
and go back and forth
its like you had two lovely little chocolates here and couldnt decide which one to eat
you ate them both
yeah go ahead
let marky talk
youre recording

i just do something smart

what kind of mask did she have on
mommy had a mask on
the bad lady had a mask like mommys face
she wasnt your real mommy
the one who looked like your mommy wasnt your real mommy
your real mommy couldnt do such horrible things „ right
-uh yeah
yeah ‡ i see
oh ‡ really
oh ‡ really
youre tough or stuffed
eat the little pieces there
yeah ‡ eat up those little grungy little pieces
ross ‡ youve gotta
no no t v until youve eaten those little bites
no mercy
we dont give any mercy around this place
marks gotta finish that last one
youve gotta finish that last one
finish that last
i want the whole pl
no ‡ ross
ross ‡ bring us that big piece
you eat the rest
and ill eat this one
you eat the rest of the little pieces
you want one
ill eat one of the little pieces he doesnt eat
yes ‡ you may be excused „ yes
just live with it
she did
had she done something really wrong
what was she gonna do
hurt the children
make you die
the bad lady went to jail so that came out okay „ right
oh ‡ good
what were you saying
well ‡ if i hadnt done that smart stuff my neck would have come off
but it wouldnt have come off in real life if it had happened in real life
hey mark ‡ thats
thats very dangerous
mark ‡ you could really slip and fall on your noggin
what your noggin is your head
whats that „ mark
yes ‡ thats true
oh ‡ thats true
your pretty teeth
im guessing youre
you know when your tooth is starting to come out it gets wiggly
does it
how do you know
her teeth falling out
one of her teeth
each one of you
how many kids
thats a lot of wiggles
okay ‡ mark
yes ‡ you may please be excused
thats good „ dear
thats because this is your real mamma and not that nasty woman with a mask
your real mamma does not have a mask
and she loves you
she doesnt break your neck either
your real mommy is a lovely woman
you gotta watch out for those
im not sure whether i recorded this or not from yesterday
but i think i should
-um it i was telling ross yesterday that -um
wait a second
im having a little trouble with this recording level
-uh i think ill turn it down
hold on
-uh okay ‡ im gonna record down at a lower level
record at a lower
oh ‡ there we go
yesterday i was -uh telling ross that i -uh caught him lying
now ‡ im trying to remember what the lie was that i caught him doing
-uh oh ‡ yes
he said
i asked him how many cookies he had
and he said he had -uh two
and he was on his third
and i said
you mean three
youre on your third now „ right
and he said
yeah ‡ i was just checking to see if you knew
or something he said
and i said
ross ‡ dont lie to me
you know parents know an awful lot
and they can catch their little children when they lie
and i really dont like it when you lie
and he said
yeah ‡ i i k i ch i sh
s s s so ‡ before this i said
you mean three youve had
yes ‡ yes ‡ ive had three
he said
i he corrected himself to say
yes ‡ ive had three
so that he cleaned up his lie a little bit
and then then i went through the spin of parents -uh can tell if children have lies
and he said
yeah ‡ thats w i p i know parents can find lies
thats why i -uh i changed and told the truth
and -uh and i said
you know ross its not worth it to lie because parents know a lot of things so they can find out when they make lies
and -uh you know and so ross interpreted this not as -uh a thing that he should watch out for or worry about because parents are always going to find out his lies but as a statement about parental skills being more than childrens skills
and he said
yeah ‡ well ‡ you cant learn how to break dance
of course because its true
it is parental skills
right ‡ it is parental skills
and he wanted to point out that
okay ‡ so ‡ youre so great
you can tell about lies
but i can breakdance
well ‡ what would be the other way of him proving it
oh ‡ well ‡ ill watch
youre you have a good point
ill try not to
i the other was point would
ill try not to lie because it is
youre right
it is a good idea in life not to get caught
and its -uh you know it was to take it as an admonition rather than as a challenge
he took it as a challenge to -uh to his ability
i he may have taken it as an admonition too
but then he he had a real gleam in his eye
well ‡ i can brea
and he thought he was so cute showing that something that he could do
but -uh anyway
you hadnt gotten on top of him
he certainly
he i hadnt gotten on top of him
that was the thing
and hes certainly working to to to maintain a full conversational presence
i think would be a full persona
he did pretty well
i mean he didnt quite make it through because he missed the point
tell them about his little conversation with mark and rosss interaction with us
oh ‡ ross
on the side of well this conversation about mark telling us about his dream witch
talking about a witch or
ross said -uh
he didnt say anything „ did he
he didnt say anything
he had a gleam in his eye
but his
and laughing along with the two of us
he said
no ‡ he did say one thing
he said something about
she wasnt your real mom „ was she
real mom wouldnt act like that „ would she
mom in other words mommy
he unders he sort of understood that dreams do reflect a little bit of reality
and -uh that -uh isnt it cute that mark isnt in on that yet
yeah ‡ well ‡ you and i were kind of smiling at each other
and he picked up on that
right ‡ right ‡ we were smiling
and he picked up on that
and in the same tenor he actually sort of verbalized a little bit about it with
he was in the know
yeah ‡ he was
with his parents
with his parents m l le about little baby brother
isnt it cute
hes hes do he does a lot of that
marky came up the stairs and said
im homesick
and ross said
you are at home
and he said
im homesick not seasick
because im at home and because of my swishing around head
i guess he had probably came up the stairs too fast and feeling dizzy
and oh at last i get to go to the bathroom
mark drew a maze
and he showed me a star at the top of the page
and he said
you see that i put the star there
and i said

-um here
i am absolutely not going to promise you anything because i have been trapped into promising too much and i dont wanna promise anything
dont make the beep
now ross how did you get daddy to get you gadget
how did you persuade your father to do that
i just told you i did you didnt try to get me into the corner to do it
you didnt try to trap me into it
you sure
youd already earned money hadnt you
you didnt know how much you had so then you went and checked how much you had right
and you figured you might have enough
so then
and then i said i wont promise to take you today right
and then what happened
no then you came out and while i was mowing the lawn did this campaign about today or tomorrow today or tomorrow right
and i said who knows right
and then finally i gave in right
how did it happen
aha but before that i already started to promise you
how did i give in
you dont remember
aha you you asked me about ten times
but you asked me about ten times you know today or tomorrow right
and finally
aha and then i said ill make you a deal if you read a book then ill get it tonight
you started on three right
yeah two books and you started on a third but they were real simple werent they
so you didnt get
nah no
you mean like fiddling in s
in father christmas yeah
fiddling not
fiddling buttons fiddling buttons means you have to fiddle with them
anyway finally i got persuaded but the deal that weve struck
this is gonna be the last present for a long time
right ross
and also what happens if we get down there and you dont have enough money for a gadget
thats a present that i had recommended
have to earn more money and what happens are you gonna buy any toys down there then
and then bring most of your money back home
okay and then go back when you had more
okay and what if you had almost enough money not quite
then will you pay me back for the extra amount that i give you
yeah and what else
he said ill help mom take out silverware and stuff out of the dishwasher
sounds good ross
okay and what about mark what is he gonna do to earn extra money in case
what if what if we
thats good you do a good job on grass
hes the grass expert
aha like what
and you know the deal is that
were not going to buy you any more things unless it comes out of your money from now on okay
you understand
what did you say
no that wasnt what you told me you said that she gave you this
why do you needta earn the two dollars
to pay off daddy
is that right
you paid off his whole debt
cause he said he done all the books
he had done
and i gave him the other money because i wanted him to give that to you
only the dollar was your p your part and the rest of that money was just because i wanted somebody to give daddy the money
you understand ross
i didnt explain it to ross
well the of twenties were -um
he thought he was paying off his debt
ah isnt that sweet
well he was paying off part of it
how much has he paid off mom
he paid off one
okay ross explain what happened
the stiff ones yeah
oh for the bet
well that wasnt the way you presented it to me though when you came up there ross
oh you didnt understand the whole thing because you think mommy didnt explain
i didnt say anything i said heres the one
well i told him he would get in real trouble if he was misrepresenting
said heres the one give daddy the rest of this
i didnt explain what it was
i see
no wonder he was under the impression that maybe that was gonna clear his debt so how much of your debt have you cleared ross
how much of your debt have you cleared
but we know theres a way for you to do this
well markys done puzzles he should get more money than just a quarter
oh yeah marks done a lot
he put away a lot of -uh
how much should he get
well i think that a dollar awful much though you gave ross more than you should have gotten
yeah i know
give mark another quarter
marky get another quarter
put it in your bank
you can pay me off later
now heres the deal mom

well why do you think time flies ross
you just played a joke
in fact you really got tricked by the sun didnt you
he went behind no by the mountain

you didnt get in markys head to have his dream
how do you get inside markys head
you dont know yet but you just did

oh yeah
and her boyfriend is called
ross alexander
ross alexander macwhinney
ross alexander macwhinney

are you sure youre not her boyfriend
his name is ross
better than those dumb hated mud people
were there mud people in your dream
you cant kick mud people
know what ross
i see
isnt that funny
how many kids wanna eat breakfast with daddy
mhm yes
he brought a picture to me and i said dia
what is that dia
and he said dia
and he went back and he wrote dia
and i said dia
oh its -uh dia
and he said dia
a and he took it to mary and he said “look mom its a mobby” dia
-uh i mean dia
and whats interesting about this is that he hes a little bit earlier he was saying whats -uh and said its a and whats -uh and this is a and he kept on spelling random letter combinations and i hadta pronounce them dia
a lot of them were unpronounceable dia
and he seems to have gotten the idea that you can just ts throw letters together and some how theyll make a word dia
this is very much like -uh when he was a little baby he useta sort of make up words even though they didnt really mean anything sort of to describe some unspecifiable thing dia
now he is writing them out dia
mary says that she useta do that when she was a kid dia
now i certainly never remember doing any thing like that dia
she also remembers -uh taking pictures to people and asking them what what they were dia
again id never do i mean any where near like that dia
i can never did anything in fact that i can remember that was very fantasy oriented at all dia
ross is having some -uh orange juice and -uh i take took a little sip from glass before -uh dia
and ross complains said “daddy took some of mine” or something like that he said dia
and i said “im just testing” dia
and he said “youre not testing” dia
whatd you say
i already had a glass dia
and which means that dia
i already had some and i liked it dia
i already had some and i liked it yeah dia
you youd already poured me a glass and you knew it was okay at that point dia
and i knew it was okay dia
so why are you checking for the consistency at a later point
it couldnt have changed by now
i asked ross dia
yeah youre being nice
and then when were you so nice
and he said “i hadta be that way all the way home yesterday” dia
hadta be that way all the way home yesterday dia
in the car coming home from washington dc dia
mhm yes
thats true
you were good yesterday
well why do i have to make breakfast and bring you things

just make coffee for me
just make the rolls for me
just serve myself forget you
would you like some tea honey
mhm yes
and then if you say yes i have to go out there and make it instead of drinking my coffee
why do i have to be nice like that huh
ross come back
oh hes gonna give you a kiss
maybe hes come and do something nice
he came around and got his own honey instead of asking someone for it
because he knew that if he he would be told that he was asking and demanding for too too many things right
ross use your spoon when you do that okay
you dont want him pour it
no its too much
youre gonna lose your spoon
twirl your spoon
twirl it around
now go

marky -uh just did a picture and he said “i cant wait all day” dia

what he meant was that he wanted me too -uh dia
i assume that what he wanted was me to put a name on it and have me date it dia
look at it or something yeah dia
pay some attention to it dia
and -um so i put a name on it date it and -uh i said “okay go put it over on rosss desk” and he said “ill put it in pile” dia

you were done with that page huh
on to the next
okay this one says
who can be a race car driver
who would be a race car driver
why would a man
could a woman be a race car driver
how come
because theyre just as smart as a guy
do you think women are as smart as men
youre right you know that
and you know what else
some women are even smarter than men
a lot of men are
of course there are some men who are smarter than some women too
thats all you wanna say
who can play football
whos firstname
your counselor at camp can play football
is firstname a boy or a girl
a boy
thats oh
does his brother play
mm because theyre family
theyre related right
lots of times people from the same family look the same dont they
we dont
i think we do
you picture your baby picture looks like my baby picture kind of
did you know that
so why you think they have a woman there throwing a football
its because
does that look right
it does
so women can play football
and can men play football
is that is one of them better than the other at playing football
whos better
how come boys are better at football
why because its what -um why is it why is it not likely a woman
i dont understand because
that doesnt tell me why
can you tell me why
i dont understand because
why is it because you see it on tv all the time thats always men playing football
is that why
same thing for sewing
is it because we always see women sewing and not men
is that why
who can help bake cookies

just girls
they should
they should help out just as much shouldnt they

here firstname they can hear you

yeah but you probably wouldnt wanna eat too many
you know why
you could get sick to your stomach
okay are we done with that
alright what does this one say
who can feed a baby
who is that
thats a daddy
do dads usually feed the babies
who feeds the babies most of the time
the women
why do you think they do that
well but the baby is their dads son or daughter too
so why wouldnt he feed them more
but you just told me that you thought the women do it more
is that because you see them
or you just think they do it more
or you know they do it more
because someone tells you
you know they do it more
how do you know
you know you are true
theres still more moms who stay home and take care of the babies and feed the babies more
and then a long time ago it was the moms who did all the times and the dads who never helped
and then the dads decided they did they missed out on playing with the babies and feeding them and they wanted to have more fun so they said to the mom
i wanna help out some more
i wanna be close to my kids so im going to help out more
i dont want the mom to have all the fun
do you think its work or is it fun to feed a baby
its fun
what else do you wanna say about that
anything else
nothing else
alright whats this one
who can be a cheerleader
whos usually a cheerleader
because you have to wear a skirt
you think a guy would look funny in a skirt
well you know what
when you go to big football games and stuff you see guys dressed up too theyre not like theyre not in a dress like a cheerleader
but theres what do they call them
theres a name for them spirit guys
and they go out there and what they do they need somebody strong so they have the guy lift the ladies up in the air and throw them up in the air and they yell and scream and cheer
but in the old days they useta just have women be cheerleaders
did you know that
come here lets sit down
lets sit down
alright heres the next one
here look here
whos this
whats he whats he doing
i cant hear
can you talk louder
who can deliver the newspapers
is that a boy or a girl
a boy
do you think just boys can deliver newspaper
who else can
or girls
yes that little girl is delivering papers
but it was her brothers paper route
she was just helping him
but anybody can have that job cant they
did you know one of our neighbors one of the dads lost his job at work
so he took a paper route
so it was a dad who was delivering newspaper
do you think thats a good idea
yeah because he needed money didnt he
i dont remember his name
no well hes a mailman
can a can a mailman be a man or a woman
should be a mail person shouldnt it
thats the right way to say it because it can be a man or a woman
its not just a mailman right
who can play with toy trucks
girls and boys
do you think they both do it
do you think lots of girls play with trucks
do you think lots of boys play with trucks
why is that
because you see them do it
you think so
how come you think why do boys like trucks more than women
you think its because they make a loud noise and they can crash them around
its exciting
do you think girls like to do that
make all the sounds
be construction people
enough of that one
-uh lets see this one says
who can be a sailor
men both
and alien
now youre being silly arent you
okay who would more likely be a sailor
a man or a woman
a man why do you think that
because women dont like to go on boats
you think so
did hey you know what
do you know daddys aunt
she was a navy nurse so she was on boats for twenty years in the service
did you know that
she was a navy nurse so you can probably call her a sailor huh
do you think she liked being that
you dont wanna discuss that one anymore
youre not interested in sailing huh
whos this one say
who can pick flowers
so thats not just for girls or boys
or little kids
or big kids
you think they like that
but why
you ask me why all the time
i wanna ask you why
here youre going to fall on couch
do you like flowers
do you think firstname likes flowers
why not
because hes a boy
here come here
because you think you think -uh boys dont like flowers as much as girls
why is that
is it because their moms teach them to be that way do you think
or you think their dads teach them to be that way
do you really dont know or are you just goofing around
okay youre not are you being serious
okay shall we move on to the next one
okay here we needta be serious okay
because we really wanna know what you think
because we think that you know a lot of things
and were waiting for you to tell us how much you know
heres another question
who can paint a house
here lets be serious okay
lets be serious okay
who can paint a house
people anybody
as long as you got an arm right
you got an arm they can paint
why not
you can paint with one arm
couldnt you
well it might be hard but if you can climb up on a ladder you can paint right
but youd have to be able to see wouldnt you
youd have to have eyes because in order to paint you needta see what youre doing huh
okay so thats a woman painting
do you think a lot of women like to paint
do you think they like to paint houses or do they paint pictures
and theyre and theyre artists and they do women do more of that
who does more painting houses
why is that
do you think painting houses is harder
so is that why a man would do it
and is painting a picture easier
is that why a woman would do it
you think women cant do hard stuff
is that what youre telling me
they cant
how come
oh so women dont have enough muscles
is that it
why is that
you dont know
who can be a firefighter
whos that
is that a man or a woman
a man
can only men be firefighters
pra probably do you see more men firefighters or women firefighters
more men
why do you think that is
you know why
probably because if you have to run into a building and save people they want you to be strong so you can lift out people and drag them out of the house
especially if they cant walk or if theyre unconscious
thats probably why they want big strong people
so maybe if youre a big strong woman you could be a firefighter huh
what do you think
hm okay
here the next one is who does the dusting
who can do dusting
are you serious with the dogs and cats
what do you mean who can do more of the dusting
who does who can do that
why do women do that
because their moms teach them and thats their job huh
do you feel that way
i feel that way sometimes
my mom taught me dust the house clean the house thats womens work
do you think thats fun
mm do you think its fun cleaning it
do you think that should just be our job
because if the boys get the house dirty too shouldnt they clean
so how about if we split the job fifty huh
what does that mean
oo move on okay
who can drive a truck
who is this in here
yeah it looks like a woman
so women can drive trucks
where does she drive the truck at
well where does she live
on the farm yeah
so do you think lots of women who live on farms drive trucks
how about women in the city
do you think they drive trucks
why not
because they dont have to
they dont have to work on the farm
do they have to drive truck may probably because they prefer not to drive the truck
they want a bmw or a convertible like you huh
you dont
you dont think youd look cool driving a truck
youd look cool driving a convertible
why do you think so
what you think youll look like a boy
why would you look like an idiot driving a truck
you dont like trucks
you think most girls dont like trucks
why because its associated with work
or boys
is it because boys drive trucks that you dont wanna drive one
who can play hopscotch
anybody can
yeah i ike to play hopscotch
who does the most hopscotch
and of kids which kind of kids do the most hopscotch
why is that
because theyre more coordinated than boys
you think boys cant hop on one foot
they can or they cant
they cant
but are girls better than that
better than boys at hopscotch
or is it because you have to sing a song
do you sing a song when you do that or
were done
who can be ballet dancer
who does that
a ballerina
is that boys or girls do that
can boys be ballet dancers too
no boys
is it just girls
you know what
you i have to take you to the ballet sometime
theres a guy named firstname who is an excellent dancer
and they dance with the women
they throw them up in the air too
you think most boys dont like to dance
why dont they like to dance
they think its sissy stuff
they think its sissy stuff or maybe its the costumes
the guys wouldnt like to wear tights right
come here on couch reaching microphone
you dont think boys like to wear tights
you think they would be afraid someone would call them a sissy
but ballet is a beautiful dance
and its nice to have partners when you dance
so it cant be all women
whats this
ooh why you saying
who can do aerobics
why youre saying
oh you like those psychedelic pants huh
so who is this
a boy
do boys do aerobics
so do women
yeah who do you think likes to do aerobics more
men or women
why do men like to do aerobics more
you think they just like to have be more fit more physically fit than women
or you just think they like to exercise with music dance with music huh
mm you guess
do you have you seen men and women do aerobics
how many are there usually more men or women in the classrooms when you see them
more men in them
youve been in different rooms than ive been
i usually see more women do aerobics
you know that
because ive heard sometimes that men think that its a womans exercise
the men like to lift weights
have you seen that
men lifting weights
because they want big strong muscles
they want
they get fat
i dont think thats why the do lifting weights to get fat
they do it to be strong
or if they think theyre a small guy they wanna get bigger muscles
thats why they work out
they dont wanna be called a wimp do they
if theyre the size of your brother is your brother small
so youd think he would wanna work out
and be bigger

see this measuring cup
it has a cup of water in it
-uh huh
would you pour the water into this white cup over here please for me
yes i am
you pour it into that cup
now i wanna ask you an important question
do you have the same amount of water in the purple cup as you have in this white in
big measuring cup
how do you know
it the same water
would you pour the water back into the measuring cup for me
try not to spill it
would you please pour the water in the yellow cup please
thank you
now can you tell me do you have the same amount of water as was in the measuring cup
in the yellow cup
how do i know
but look laura
this this is taller
but its taller and that ones lower
show me again
how do i know its the same water
you poured it from one cup to the other
laura has repeated the whole task
pouring task
would you pour it this water in that all the other glasses please
thats a good idea
go ahead
now why dont you stop pouring right there
we need some in your measuring cup
oh youre gonna make it even in each cup
do you have the same amount in each cup do you think
well how will you know when you have the same amount in the measuring cup
okay youve taken a little water from each cup
now in
how are you deciding laura that theres the same amount in each cup
are you looking on the side of the cup
but but this cup is taller
and skinnier than this cup
dont you have to put more water in that cup
shes not putting this in
shes not compensating
were just making it the
even this taller one
look how much 1 the purple 2
how come it doesnt matter
i think it matters
so laura just measured the water level
they all have the same amount of water
are you sure
you in
this tall glass has as much as this big wide glass
how come
lauras pouring from the wide glass into the smaller glass and making the water levels be
very interesting laura
now if this glass was filled with milk laura in
im gonna fill two glasses
if these glasses were filled not with water but chocolate milk the ones that you made equal which glass would you choose to have your chocolate milk out of
which one do you want
now lauras doing eeny meeny miny mo
because in
so youre gonna do eeny meeny miny mo on all of them huh
so youre gonna keep this tall in
im gonna show you something laura
lets pour this water out in
in this cup
and i want you to measure how much water in
was in your tall glass
in the measuring cup
what line does it come up to
okay in
now lets measure the water that was in the purple cup
you pour it
dont spill it because we wanna measure it carefully
how far does that come up too
a little over
so which cup had more
the purple cup or the y yellow cup
purple cup
why do you think that is if you made the two cups equal
by the same amount
thats right
you have to put a little more in the yellow cup
getting a little closer
in in
why do you think you have to keep pouring more into the yellow cup
well how is the yellow cup different from the purple cup
thats right
its taller
and how is the purple cup different cup
now youve got it right
yellow cup different from the purple cup

i just pushed you off the raft

and then
and then i say to you i thought we were friends
because you have to relax when youre floating on the water

use your imagination
tell me what you how you think they mightve gotten here in the story

that makes sense
was he lying in wait underwater
or was he on land
how does
how would he get in
-mm you were doing so good
you kinda told me
yeah probably jumped on
so where do you think they are
what part of the world
anything else you think might be in these waters
or around here
so where do you think theyre gonna be headed now
you can make it up
if you were in a boat with a lion would you be going somewhere
trying to get out as fast possible
or what would you be doing
yeah swim away
that makes sense
please try not to touch the mic or were gonna hear a sound okay
put your arm down jack

is this real life
like whats going on up here

youre right
youre right
there we go
yeah mhm
so what is she what is she holding
what do you think shes doing with that
yeah thats a good experiment to do
what is this guy doing
do you think a scientist would just let an octopus watch her while she does a lightbulb experiment
i know its kind of a silly picture
well what does it look like hes holding or doing
like organization in the lab
sit down jack
and then are these mice supposed to be here
okay so you think they what

alright last one in this activity
whats going on here
thats kind of a lot of them
have you ever seen that many in one place

ope were almost done with the made up words
so just make it through a few more okay
this is a foo
good job
this one well call a pite
last one
this ill call a yock
awesome job
thank you for bearing with me with these made up words
i know thats silly
youre ready with that buzzer
ope im gonna scoot this around your hand
and well
he gave you little fireworks
thats awesome
so you know how you
you know how you talk to siri
and siri sometimes knows what to say and sometimes doesnt
its kinda like that
jibos just doing his best to respond to what you do
so i want you to look at this picture and tell me everything you see
and whats going on in the picture
with what
oh yeah
thats what i would call them too
do they look like anything you would know or
what kind
ope were gonna stay on here just a little bit more
what kind of flowers
any ideas
thats a good guess
so hh uw how do
oh those ones
so how do you think they got in this situation
like what would you say had to happen for this to
if we had to use our imagination and make up a story why would this boy be in the boat with the lion
how did that happen
what would you have to do to get into a boat with a lion
would you never do that
or would you always do that if someone asked you
but why
thats a good point
so what ay are there any reasons why the lion is not eating the boy right now
any idea
oh okay
so what
yeah i would as well
i totally agree with that
so if the lions happy and the boys in the boat where do you think theyre going
like what would make the lion happy
mm like home
thats a good idea
any other ideas about this picture that you think
moving on to the next one
thats a really good description
because not a lot of people pick up on that
why do you think the artist drew it like that
like what whats the point of having that all up there
oh so its part of the imagination
you do
it might be from all the noise
-um so
what else is silly about this picture
like whats different than you would expect
and you told me why that you think thats there
does this his room look like your room
thats a good idea too
what else about his room is like your room or not like your room
oh for sure
yeah what da
oh you dont have a goldfish
-um what about here is different in your room
what do you have instead
what a weird set of things to be under the bed
did you do anything with those
thats smart
thats maybe not so smart
-um so what is he wearing
do you have any clothes like that you could use to pretend to be a pilot
so do you dress up as anything though
do you have dress up clothes
not much
last thing
anything else you havent told me about yet in this picture
do you even have that many pillows in your room to pile up
anything else
youre oh youre elbow okay
thats awesome
do you recognize any of these things up here that theyre using
so what do you think is happening in the situation
like why is the octopus there
oh what did you call it
i could see how that would be the
im sorry for correcting you
but no ih ih at first it looks like an elephant
so why do you think it would be there
she caught it
oh my gosh
so shes trying to study it
while hes doing what
what a smart octopus
and so what do you think theyre
ope please dont touch jibo
thank you
-um its the same thing as anything else expensive
we dont wanna have people touch it when theyre not supposed to
so that it doesnt get broken
-um so what do you think the rats are doing here
do you think she doesnt
do you think she cares if theyre there
or do you think she minds
that makes sense
if you had to do science would you do science like her
or would you do something different
like what
youre interested in every
well then i see why you come to c o s i so often then
you wanna learn about everything
thats awesome
anything else you can see in this picture
thats a good description
it is pretty silly
so what where is she
like what is this place
have you ever been on a farm before
was it
did it look like this farm
what was different about it
you just kinda dont wanna talk about it
oh gotcha
kinda hard to remember
so what is she wearing
so who do you think she is
so do you think she owns the farm
or what do you thinks think is going on here
oh shes helping out
ih you gotta be pretty strong to do that ↫hh↫how big that is
thats true
so what did she use to do that
ope that one there
that makes sense
any other ideas about whats going on here
good description
thats a really good observation
oh well the same way that siri can respond to sound
but also visuals with our robot
it responds to things that goes on around him
so now tha were done were gonna see what happens
maybe it likes other buzzers better
i dont know
youre doing an awesome job
