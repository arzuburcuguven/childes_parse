@Comment:	Time is 0:11
@Comment:	Chi began by reading the story. She was interrupted a few times by conversations between her parents and brother. Once she started the letter she worked quickly , quietly , and independently. She asked Mot for the spelling of a few words , but the correct spellings didn't make it into the letter. Sometimes she asked and was ignored because the adults were talking , and sometimes Mot seemed evasive (she probably isn't sure of the spelling herself). Chi's letter fills the entire page , and has structure like <dear Eric Carle> and <by Chi> , but very little punctuation
*INV:	Dear Eric Carle I Like The very hungry caterpillar .
