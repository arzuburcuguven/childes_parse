*PAR0:	so just like last time we're going to ask some questions since we have multiple reporters going on . 15840_22640
*PAR0:	I'm not going to write anything for you . 22640_24320
*PAR0:	okay . 24320_24460
*PAR0:	yeah . 24460_24880
*PAR0:	&-um do you remember what William played with last time . 24880_29900
*PAR0:	I think it was the plastic food which was so fascinating . 29900_32180
*PAR0:	&-um I know &-uh in fact so fascinating that we went out and bought a we got a bunch of plastic food which he loves playing with . 32180_40160
*PAR0:	&-um but he's less interested in it this time around probably because he's so happy to play with it . 40820_45880
*PAR0:	so I think it's <a little> [/] a little less &-uh because it's lost its &-um Allure hi . 46040_52600
*PAR0:	&-um so I guess I answered your question . 53200_55380
*PAR0:	what do they play with plastic . 55600_56400
*PAR0:	yes . 56580_56780
*PAR0:	and this time did you see any differences in . 57100_59660
*PAR0:	um'm surprised . 59660_61020
*PAR0:	he went &-uh first for the clock which he's never expressed any interest at all for no interest in the baby . 61020_66900
*PAR0:	&-um which is normally his [/] his fascinating . 66900_69360
*PAR0:	it will stop him when [/] when he sees the baby no interest that surprised me &-um played with the plush animals . 69360_77060
*PAR0:	which is another first . 77060_78100
*PAR0:	&-uh he's [/] he's only remotely sort of interested in the dog toys but not all plush toys like these . 78100_84220
*PAR0:	and so this is a good boy . 84220_87500
*PAR0:	&-um so that's new . 87500_90400
*PAR0:	&-um what else was new . 90400_93740
*PAR0:	yeah I flush was just the newest . 93740_96440
*PAR0:	okay . 96440_97220
*PAR0:	okay . 97220_97520
*PAR0:	do you think there's any &-um on the camera . 97520_101200
*PAR0:	so bad shiny words next to it . 101200_105380
*PAR0:	&-um do you think there are any of the we'll start with the food that you've identified names of . 105380_112280
*PAR0:	oh &-um probably not because none of what we're seeing is anything that I will feed . 112280_118740
*PAR0:	him so to correlate that maybe it'd be a like a stretch to say that . 119040_123820
*PAR0:	he actually recognizes it as a food product . 123820_125960
*PAR0:	I I'm not sure why it's so interesting to him . 126500_128780
*PAR0:	&-um is there anything that you do feed him . 129060_133060
*PAR0:	but it probably comes in different form . 133060_136200
*PAR0:	I need it . 136400_137020
*PAR0:	&-uh the peas would be it . 137020_138520
*PAR0:	&-um and of course he didn't have any interest in that . 138900_141480
*PAR0:	I don't think he correlated the with the blood . 141540_145980
*PAR0:	in fact he stopped eating them about &-uh a week ago . 146040_148700
*PAR0:	so . 148700_148960
*PAR0:	oh okay yeah . 149240_150300
*PAR0:	now nothing else here is what he eats . 150300_152060
*PAR0:	&-uh any of the animal names that are the ones that we have from the house this way . 153020_161080
*PAR0:	you can come to me if you want . 161860_163520
*PAR0:	good call . 163540_164340
*PAR0:	&-um we don't have any of those animals either . 164680_169340
*PAR0:	so these are all going to be new as well . 169540_172440
*PAR0:	we have like elephants and that kind of thing . 172720_176220
*PAR0:	very few barnyard owls or sea creatures . 176220_178280
*PAR0:	&-um oh he likes the bee . 178280_180820
*PAR0:	I'm sorry that was a new thing . 180940_181920
*PAR0:	he likes the bees here . 182020_182780
*PAR0:	I don't remember that . 182840_183420
*PAR0:	he was as interested last time I think I showed it to him . 183420_186320
*PAR0:	and he didn't care . 186320_186940
*PAR0:	and this time he was on his own interested in it . 187120_188980
*PAR0:	sorry . 189380_189620
*PAR0:	go ahead . 189620_189980
*PAR0:	no [/] no that's [/] that's good . 190440_191840
*PAR0:	&-uh that's those are [/] are the things I wanna know . 192100_193980
*PAR0:	so at home does he does play with the dolls . 193980_197600
*PAR0:	&-um with a doll baby doll . 197600_199080
*PAR0:	maybe there is a doll that we have at the house . 199080_201240
*PAR0:	and this is the first time that I have seen him disinterested in . 202000_205780
*PAR0:	&-uh a doll with an actual a real face on it . 205780_209140
*PAR0:	&-um normally toys or dolls have he's not interested in but with a human face he's fascinated . 209560_215320
*PAR0:	does he what kind of things does he how does he play with the dolls . 216120_219680
*PAR0:	does he feed it or he kisses them . 219820_221680
*PAR0:	&-um okay . 222420_223440
*PAR0:	I mean &-uh and then chews on their head which is like he [/] he interacts with it like he would with a [/] a baby at a playgroup . 223560_230160
*PAR0:	okay . 230540_231360
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah but no feeding &-um mostly just poking in the eye . 231860_236500
*PAR0:	just what they like to do . 237020_237940
*PAR0:	scary a little bit . 238600_241600
*PAR0:	yeah . 242100_242720
*PAR0:	does he did you find that &-uh did he make friends with you . 243500_247860
*PAR0:	did find that he was wise to him at home . 247980_256560
*PAR0:	and his interest in them is normally to hold one or two and chew on it as I read to him and then to grab mine . 256560_265040
*PAR0:	so we swap . 265040_265820
*PAR0:	and then I read the next one without finishing . 265820_267940
*PAR0:	&-um so to say here his interest in the book is significantly less . 267940_274400
*PAR0:	but then again at home when we have books there's no other toys around . 275180_277600
*PAR0:	&-um so I guess that you know with a captive audience he [/] he he'll play with what he's got . 278320_283440
*PAR0:	&-um yeah he's definitely interested in the toys more than the books . 283560_286340
*PAR0:	okay . 286740_287780
*PAR0:	in this environment for sure where there [/] there was a book there that you did pick up . 288060_292020
*PAR0:	right . 292020_292460
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 292840_293280
*PAR0:	I was reading this &-uh Mr Brown can move . 293280_295980
*PAR0:	can you I was reading that in the other room to him . 295980_298980
*PAR0:	and we hadn't quite finished it . 299240_300520
*PAR0:	and . 300680_300740
*PAR0:	we were almost to the end . 300740_302060
*PAR0:	and so it was very tempting to try to finish it because I wanted to see how it ended . 302140_305960
*PAR0:	&-um so there you go . 306500_308100
*PAR0:	that's why I was reading him the book . 308320_309700
*PAR0:	okay . 310820_311360
*PAR0:	and how about any of the objects like the utensils or even &-um spoons and keys are big favorites . 311700_318200
*PAR0:	&-um they rattle and they bang nicely against things . 318700_322460
*PAR0:	and &-um yeah . 322780_324840
*PAR0:	so I'd say that those objects are a continuous favorite . 324840_327620
*PAR0:	hi and me . 328200_329700
*PAR0:	yes . 330060_330360
*PAR0:	hello . 330480_330660
*PAR0:	and &-uh I think we ask this every time &-um the toy that we have here that &-uh suits his personality the best it suits his personality . 331520_343180
*PAR0:	the best &-um anything that you can stack . 343180_347340
*PAR0:	although I'm beginning to think that maybe he gets as much enjoyment out of my reaction to him knocking to stack things down as knocking it down . 347340_355640
*PAR0:	yes hello . 355640_356720
*PAR0:	so I would probably say the block like things that you have because he will consistently play with them . 356720_366020
*PAR0:	so using the food more as block building . 366540_369600
*PAR0:	oh yeah [/] yeah he doesn't . 369920_371080
*PAR0:	no it's not real food . 371700_372760
*PAR0:	it's yeah just something that will make noise and [/] and &-uh be fun to knock . 372860_376520
*PAR0:	okay . 376860_377720
*PAR0:	and throw and chew on . 377840_379420
*PAR0:	&-um were there any toys &-uh where you said you had the food . 380400_385140
*PAR0:	you have the food at home . 385140_386260
*PAR0:	there any other books or toys that you have at home that he may recognize . 386420_390820
*PAR0:	&-um are you talking about specific titles of books or just the books themselves . 391420_395020
*PAR0:	I think it's just the books themselves . 395760_397280
*PAR0:	yeah . 397380_397520
*PAR0:	we have board books at home . 397520_398760
*PAR0:	sure . 398760_399060
*PAR0:	in mass . 399060_399980
*PAR0:	and &-um of course the plastic food is at home . 400120_402820
*PAR0:	the keys the spoons are common toys . 402980_406260
*PAR0:	and like I said the animal toys and his toys intermingle . 406840_410160
*PAR0:	but again so I could say that he has plush toys but not much interest at home . 410160_415040
*PAR0:	&-um key spoons but we didn't play with those this time . 415280_417320
*PAR0:	we were playing with keys instead . 417760_419400
*PAR0:	same effect although the keys are more interesting . 420080_423180
*PAR0:	I don't know why . 423180_424320
*PAR0:	hi . 424320_425980
*PAR0:	just as a general rule in fact for every kid that I've encountered . 425980_430060
*PAR0:	it's the same . 430060_430780
*PAR0:	hi . 431320_432000
*PAR0:	oh you you've been using the sounds huh . 433060_436740
*PAR0:	oh he's been using them for a while . 437020_438180
*PAR0:	he's just quiet . 438260_439140
*PAR0:	when he's in bed he's part of his house . 439140_442260
*PAR0:	yeah . 442740_443720
*PAR0:	do you wanna use any you see . 444120_446040
*PAR0:	no . 446380_446560
*PAR0:	okay . 446740_446880
*PAR0:	once he's in when I'm talking or someone else is talking who doesn't talk . 446960_451460
*PAR0:	&-um he stops and listens &-um obeying his conversation or being obedient . 452300_458040
*PAR0:	I ha that's a stretch purely his own curiosity . 459300_465260
*PAR0:	&-uh I've noticed that consistently &-um I'll be trying to engage him in a conversation . 465700_471120
*PAR0:	he'll very rarely appear to respond to me . 471340_474920
*PAR0:	mostly it's him just stopping whatever he's saying and then listening and waiting for me to keep talking about something . 474980_480400
*PAR0:	anyway . 481240_482140
*PAR0:	hm well great . 482380_484700
*PAR0:	well thank you so much for coming in . 485000_487040
*PAR0:	thank you thanks for letting us play with your toys . 487080_488900
*PAR0:	absolutely [/] absolutely I do wanna put &-um &-uh oh it's my new recorder . 489180_496140
*PAR0:	oh I'm sorry . 496420_497020
*PAR0:	we got it . 497660_499740
*PAR0:	this was participant five zero six six wt third visit . 507200_513380
