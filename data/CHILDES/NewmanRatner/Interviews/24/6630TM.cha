*PAR0:	&-um anything else . 352240_356300
*PAR0:	you notice that even during all the testing or anything you wanted to ask about or not really . 356300_363860
*PAR0:	I mean I just know like right now the only thing with his speech is that he says his l's like y's like he'll say . 363860_371340
*PAR0:	Yites or you know that's what he comes across as . 371340_373440
*PAR0:	but other than that he I mean it's nothing else . 373440_377420
*PAR0:	I noticed . 377420_377900
*PAR0:	but I had noticed that before . 377900_380340
*PAR0:	yeah . 380340_380520
*PAR0:	and [/] and L's it was a [/] a later [/] later sound song . 380520_383040

*PAR0:	&-um well he did a great job . 384260_387980
*PAR0:	today . 387980_388320
*PAR0:	he was like I said it was a it's a long session right with it . 388320_392440
*PAR0:	so &-um now I can I have &-um so at the end we can we have two consent forms for you to sign . 392760_398960
*PAR0:	okay . 398980_399260
*PAR0:	&-um let just get behind you . 399500_401060
*PAR0:	Katie &-um and I'll explain them to you real quick milk [/] milk is that some juice . 401060_406240
*PAR0:	it's milk is milk . 406800_408740
*PAR0:	&-um did you get a chance to finish filling these out . 408880_411180
*PAR0:	yes . 411220_411520
*PAR0:	and you brought . 412320_413820
*PAR0:	the other ones . 413820_414440
*PAR0:	yeah . 414620_414880
*PAR0:	it should be there with them . 414880_415800
*PAR0:	okay . 415900_415980
*PAR0:	yeah I see . 415980_416360
*PAR0:	okay . 416440_416600
*PAR0:	alright . 416800_417780
*PAR0:	so I'll just explain these real quick . 417780_420220
*PAR0:	okay . 420380_420620
*PAR0:	we'll have you sign them . 421000_421900
*PAR0:	and then we'll have a toy for him to take home . 421900_423860
*PAR0:	okay . 423860_424240
*PAR0:	&-um so like I said since we're at the end of the longitudinal study . 424240_428480
*PAR0:	&-um this is the final consent form . 428480_430620
*PAR0:	okay . 430620_431140
*PAR0:	&-um really explains a little bit more of what we were looking for . 431140_434020
*PAR0:	okay . 434020_434680
*PAR0:	&-um so what it explains is that &-um while we've [/] we've been [/] been recording [/] recording trips trip's language [/] language from [/] from seven [/] seven months [/] months until [/] until now [/] now two [/] two years [/] years &-uh we've also recorded some samples of your speech . 434680_445240
*PAR0:	okay . 445240_445940
*PAR0:	so what this is [/] is saying . 445940_448260
*PAR0:	if you agree to participate we would go back and analyze the recordings of your speech . 448260_453120
*PAR0:	basically looking for things such as your speaking rate . 453120_457460
*PAR0:	the variety of words you use . 457460_458900
*PAR0:	how carefully you might pronounce new words . 458900_462200
*PAR0:	length of your sentences . 462200_463620
*PAR0:	and what we want to see is comparing when you're talking with him and when you're talking with an adult . 463620_468640
*PAR0:	okay to you know see the differences in how you produce language you know when you're encouraging a child to repeat after you . 468640_476500
*PAR0:	right . 476500_476840
*PAR0:	&-um so that's just explaining that . 476840_479860
*PAR0:	so &-um this just needs initials and date up here . 479860_483260
*PAR0:	okay . 483560_483780
*PAR0:	and up here and then a signature . 484180_486200
*PAR0:	okay . 486660_486940
*PAR0:	and then the additional consent form . 487180_488920
*PAR0:	&-um this part is completely optional . 489640_492480
*PAR0:	&-um it's kind of a separate part of the study . 492840_495820
*PAR0:	okay . 495940_496160
*PAR0:	&-um what it explains is that recently researchers have been putting together an international database of child and parent &-um speech . 496480_503540
*PAR0:	okay . 503780_503980
*PAR0:	&-um so while &-um so basically we would like to be able to contribute to that . 504240_510860
*PAR0:	okay . 510980_511200
*PAR0:	&-um and so like I said it's entire entirely voluntary . 511500_514640
*PAR0:	but that's good . 514640_515760
*PAR0:	&-um it comes in three varieties . 515760_517980
*PAR0:	the first one you're able to pick is you do not want any of your data . 517980_522040
*PAR0:	child's data made available to other language researchers . 522040_524820
*PAR0:	basically meaning it would just be available to us here in our study at Maryland okay . 524820_529660
*PAR0:	the next option is allowing anonymous transcripts and test score data . 529660_533460
*PAR0:	and with these next twotwo anything would any identifying information would be &-um edited out . 533460_538540
*PAR0:	so there would be no his name wouldn't be involved . 538640_540740
*PAR0:	okay . 540900_541100
*PAR0:	&-um but the anonymous transcripts would be we would listen to it . 541400_544940
*PAR0:	do a written transcription . 545000_545900
*PAR0:	of . 545900_546200
*PAR0:	okay . 546200_546440
*PAR0:	upload that . 546580_547260
*PAR0:	&-um the third option is allowing anonymous audio recordings . 547540_550480
*PAR0:	okay . 550940_551160
*PAR0:	&-um so it's not the video it's just the audio and the real benefit of the audio is that &-um when we're listening for something we can you know do a transcription of that . 551220_559860
*PAR0:	but we're not going to be able to capture everything that's &-um in the language . 559860_563820
*PAR0:	so &-um like I said you're free to pick any of those three and sign that one . 563820_567520
*PAR0:	okay . 567520_568020
*PAR0:	so I'll let you have those . 568020_570380
*PAR0:	and you want me to let Trip pick out the toy or would you like . 570380_572980
*PAR0:	sure . 572980_573100
*PAR0:	no he can pick it out . 573100_574060
*PAR0:	trip [/] trip . 574060_575900
*PAR0:	you wanna pick out a toy . 575900_577480
*PAR0:	yeah I just have noticed like in teaching the past ten years that speech issues I have more and more kids with speech issues than me . 577480_584460
*PAR0:	like it's just been increasing . 584460_586020
*PAR0:	and that's what like my friends and I have noticed . 586020_588100
*PAR0:	yeah . 588100_588620
*PAR0:	where do you teach . 588620_590860
*PAR0:	&-uh my cousin goes there . 590860_597160
*PAR0:	and she's in the fourth grade farting . 597160_598720
*PAR0:	what's name . 598720_599500
*PAR0:	Shay Carroll Farting farting . 599500_600420
*PAR0:	she's in my class . 600420_601160
