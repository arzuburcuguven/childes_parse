@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	and I'm just gonna (.) video what you're doing with <your hands> [>] .
@Comment:	Time is 41:29
@Comment:	Chi is argumentative and obstinate during parts of the activity. Chi frequently prevents Mot from participating in what she is doing. There is some science talk and the Chi attempts to explain to Mot why the two silver sticks will stick to one another when they are not on the black base any longer. The video starts and stops at several points during the activity , and the middle section of this transcript is only on the videotape , not on the audiotape. Video does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
