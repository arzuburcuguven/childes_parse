*PAR4:	and oxygen . 205635_206215
*PAR4:	well where'd the air come from . 206285_207495
*PAR4:	air . 207915_208135
*PAR2:	that's the same . 209875_210615
*PAR4:	question . 211095_211175

*PAR4:	what now in the beginning in the big bang they there was a huge amount of energy . 217565_225415
*PAR4:	now we don't know exactly . 226955_228775
*PAR2:	where did the energy come from . 229545_230855
*PAR4:	there was nothing . 231145_231855
*PAR4:	okay . 232045_232335

*PAR4:	okay . 246165_246455
*PAR4:	like if you take plus three and minus three what you get . 246455_250335
*PAR4:	okay . 252045_252335
*PAR4:	so in the beginning there was nothing . 252635_253975
*PAR4:	but it was plus three and minus three . 255395_257335
*PAR2:	two things . 258315_258855
*PAR2:	nothing and nothing . 258855_259855
*PAR4:	no [/] no . 260355_260775
*PAR4:	plus three and minus . 260805_262095

*PAR4:	okay . 277485_277775
*PAR4:	and two things are weighing . 278075_279615

*PAR4:	yeah . 283805_284095
*PAR4:	but in the beginning something happened out of the nothing . 284435_286815
*PAR4:	it split apart into the plus and the minus . 288475_290615
*PAR4:	and nothing's split into the plus and the minus what's . 292355_295095
*PAR2:	that mean . 295095_295415
*PAR4:	if you add minus six you know . 296235_299095

*PAR5:	zero . 444225_444515
*PAR5:	got it . 446455_446755
*PAR5:	what if you add minus three and plus three . 447385_449275
*PAR2:	zero . 450585_450875
*PAR5:	okay . 451145_451435
*PAR5:	so in the beginning there was a zero . 451695_453195
*PAR5:	okay . 453745_454035
*PAR5:	there was a zero nothing . 454035_455115
*PAR5:	and it split apart into the minuses and the pluses . 456095_458555
*PAR5:	okay . 460515_460805
*PAR5:	okay . 461075_461365
*PAR5:	okay . 461755_462045
*PAR5:	now you would say but then we would have then how come we have anything in the world . 462465_466605
*PAR5:	well that's what the scientists are finding out . 469075_471325
*PAR5:	is that there's a sneaky trick that the pluses had over on the plus side . 472115_475335
*PAR5:	they had a sneaky trick . 475685_476815
*PAR5:	so that they made more and more pluses . 477235_478855
*PAR5:	and so there gotta be more pluses than there were minuses . 479955_482295
*PAR5:	and that's why there's that's why . 483715_485055
*PAR5:	and that's why there we . 485055_485695
*PAR5:	and that's [/] that's how we got the world . 485755_486975
*PAR2:	we got one say you know how this guy got five thousand . 487355_492015
*PAR2:	this guy got five thousand . 492015_493255
*PAR2:	mhm . 493255_493575
*PAR2:	well this guy came and Drew and that guy only had five . 493845_497535
*PAR5:	thousand . 497775_497895
*PAR5:	that's right . 497895_498375
*PAR5:	and this is called anti-matter this is called matter over here . 498475_502335
*PAR2:	what's anti-matter . 502515_503495
*PAR5:	it's like stuff that will destroy a matter and make it go back to zero . 503685_508575
*PAR5:	you take an you mix a little bit of anti-matter with a little bit of matter . 510065_512805
*PAR5:	and it'll go back to zero and nothing . 512865_514285
*PAR5:	okay . 516815_517105
*PAR5:	now there's a lot of anti-matter in the universe . 518125_520105
*PAR5:	there's a lot of it . 521495_522265
*PAR5:	but there's more matter than there is anti-matter and that's why we have a universe . 522265_528185
*PAR2:	okay . 528295_528585
*PAR2:	it matter the one over here . 528645_530025
*PAR5:	yeah . 530135_530425
*PAR5:	that's the plus got it . 530425_531825
*PAR2:	that [/] that . 532905_533955
*PAR5:	that's the answer . 534015_534675
*PAR2:	&-um okay . 535785_536765
*PAR5:	now we don't know what that sneaky trick was . 537505_539125
*PAR5:	yet . 539185_539405
*PAR5:	we're trying to figure out what that sneaky trick is . 540575_542325
*PAR2:	I wonder &-um I wondered . 544085_546885
*PAR2:	is there an opposite world . 547465_548645
*PAR5:	yeah . 549235_549525
*PAR5:	yeah I matter . 549525_550165
*PAR2:	no . 551825_552045
*PAR2:	I mean like you know how . 552085_553885
*PAR2:	there's a man who came from opposite . 554075_556005
*PAR5:	world . 556005_556205
*PAR5:	oh yeah . 556345_556725
*PAR5:	right . 556725_556925

*PAR2:	oo you . 562125_562445
*PAR5:	yeah I just made that all up . 563235_564565
*PAR5:	but I mean that there [/] there is anti-matter . 567305_569565
*PAR2:	great . 570135_570485
*PAR2:	Dad <you really> [/] you really fooled my friends . 570745_573445

*PAR2:	there's an op . 574875_575685
*PAR2:	there's probably an opposite world . 575685_577405
*PAR5:	that's okay . 577545_578205
*PAR5:	they don't they're interested . 578205_579165

*PAR5:	okay . 869305_869595
*PAR5:	now let me ask you another question . 870015_871315
*PAR5:	okay . 871505_871795
*PAR5:	&-um have you do you have you started reading . 872735_878315
*PAR2:	oh wait [/] wait tell &-um wait . 878575_880515
*PAR2:	and there [/] there there's been reports like &-um this book . 881055_887915
