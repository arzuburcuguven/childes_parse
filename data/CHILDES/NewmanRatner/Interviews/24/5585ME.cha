*PAR0:	he seemed to get I try to say both . 651200_653120
*PAR0:	yeah . 653300_653520
*PAR0:	so that's good . 653600_654220
*PAR0:	so he can kinda learn both together . 654320_655680
*PAR0:	I think she does too . 655940_656940
*PAR0:	but I don't know how much . 656940_658040
*PAR0:	yeah . 658440_658720
*PAR0:	and sometimes like you know like you were saying they might know it in one language . 658720_661380
*PAR0:	and then they don't know it in the other language . 661380_663240
*PAR0:	mhm . 663320_663540
*PAR0:	and they already have an influence . 663720_664620
*PAR0:	so right he really . 664620_666300
*PAR0:	needs to learn too like all h most of his body parts . 666300_669100

*PAR0:	Miles show me your Mimi [/] Mimi where's Mimi meme Hana show me your body parts . 673260_682740
*PAR0:	where's mommy's Hana where's mommy's Hannah I don't know . 682740_687220
*PAR0:	I'm sorry . 687220_690520
*PAR0:	&-um &-um &-um &-um &-um &-um &-um &-um please don't touch go away . 690520_727820
*PAR0:	thank you . 727820_728480
*PAR0:	it's not over . 728480_729120
*PAR0:	oh that always happens . 729120_738940
*PAR0:	so yeah . 738940_742480
*PAR0:	the first consent is just like if you were to give us permission so we'll give you permission to come back to the South Asia Piracy Channel and talk about piracy exchanges as we develop things that was the first consent you can make your own opinion . 742480_758300
*PAR0:	there's another consent . 758300_759640
*PAR0:	&-um they're actually they have an ongoing &-um visual audiovisual that institute they're trying to make with children's books . 759640_765340
*PAR0:	so can look at different aspects of their speech . 765340_768440
*PAR0:	so I think right now they have one where it's just like transcripts . 768440_772280
*PAR0:	so written out whatever they wrote for the kids speech breakers . 772280_775320
*PAR0:	they were looking at you know &-um if they just were writing down what they said or how they said things . 775320_780700
*PAR0:	but it's only as good what they wrote know . 780700_783480
*PAR0:	so now they're trying to make an audio one so you can analyze other things you know because if you didn't write it down then you can't you know you can't really &-um look at it . 783480_791580
*PAR0:	so the other concept would be to have us &-um use &-um the speech in the database . 791680_798340
*PAR0:	and we did modify everything . 798600_799780
*PAR0:	&-um and W it goes into a database without any demographic information . 800620_804680
*PAR0:	so basically even after we enter we can find your region because it wouldn't have anything correct . 805120_811280
*PAR0:	with it . 811380_811780
*PAR0:	so if you want to allow us to do that . 811860_813360
*PAR0:	there's a second event . 813360_814600
*PAR0:	there's one if you just want know &-um hit expressiveness . 814860_841840
*PAR0:	he just seems to not &-um be talking as much . 841840_844620
*PAR0:	I don't think you know I think just because of what said with &-um learning Japanese I don't think it's like he's delayed at all . 844860_850800
*PAR0:	it's just I mean I would have to look at the test after I think also because [/] because he's learning Japanese these tests might not actually show exactly what he knows right . 850880_859420
*PAR0:	you know what mean because these tests are normed on kids that only hear English so I think &-um they might show you know might not be completely accurate . 859600_867320
*PAR0:	but I think a lot of bilingual kids in the beginning age seem to you know not be learning as many words as quickly because they're learning you read . 867400_875640
*PAR0:	yeah no . 876060_876660
*PAR0:	if you've read . 876660_877140
*PAR0:	no he seems yeah no . 877140_879800
*PAR0:	he seems like he knew like you said you know invention . 879800_882400
*PAR0:	like he seemed to understand everything you were saying . 882600_884640
*PAR0:	and even with the [/] the &-um the point being I mean as he got out of like the higher levels he was having trouble . 884880_890380
*PAR0:	but those are for you know three year olds and four year olds you know what I mean . 890480_893680
*PAR0:	so we just have to keep going until we get so many wrong . 893700_896280
*PAR0:	and so it doesn't mean that I mean he's doing poorly or strictly those ones are ones that three and four year olds typically know . 896500_902240
*PAR0:	so it's okay . 902380_903420
*PAR0:	if he doesn't know it you know what I mean . 903420_904980
*PAR0:	but he [/] he [/] he . 905060_905740
*PAR0:	can know a lot . 905740_906460
*PAR0:	and like I said his like fine motor skills are really good . 906560_909260
*PAR0:	and &-um he's everything I mean I think he's okay . 909460_912380
*PAR0:	yeah every day he thinks up a new word . 912740_914320
*PAR0:	and I'm sure a little well for that one book with the one using any pictures I think it you know it's probably just because you were on both of them at the same time . 914540_931060
