*PAR0:	but he didn't even show interest in it . 240600_242920
*PAR0:	so I didn't bother . 243040_243800
*PAR0:	but there's a lot of other stuff . 244200_245360
*PAR0:	mhm . 245480_245800

*PAR0:	Choo choo trains . 281860_282520
*PAR0:	he actually that's the one thing that will keep his attention for more than thirty seconds are choo-choo trains . 283100_289680
*PAR0:	and he got those for his birthday . 289680_291080
*PAR0:	and he <plays with them and plays with them> [/] and plays with them . 291080_293780
*PAR0:	there's two . 293780_294180
*PAR0:	and they're interlocking . 294180_295100
*PAR0:	and he kept un locking them and <help me> [/] help me all morning . 295100_299380
*PAR0:	I've been putting choo-choo trains back together . 299380_301140
*PAR0:	and then it turns on . 301140_303240
*PAR0:	and it rolls around . 303240_304260
*PAR0:	and he turns it on . 304260_305300
*PAR0:	and he lets it go . 305300_306220
*PAR0:	so that's really exciting . 306220_307200
*PAR0:	hm yep . 307440_309200
*PAR0:	those are his favorites . 309500_310340
*PAR0:	when you &-um when you are playing with him at home how do you move from . 310880_317120
*PAR0:	like one thing to the next thing with him . 317120_318800
*PAR0:	hm . 320440_321380
*PAR0:	what helps him with the transition that he wants to play with it . 321520_326380
*PAR0:	he doesn't want to do something . 327380_328680
*PAR0:	he says . 328680_329500
*PAR0:	no . 329500_329780
*PAR0:	and he pretty much means . 329780_330840
*PAR0:	no . 330840_331140
*PAR0:	and there's not too much budging him on that . 331140_334300
*PAR0:	&-um sometimes just getting excited about something . 334300_338960
*PAR0:	and he'll notice that I'm interested in it . 338960_341760
*PAR0:	and then he'll want to play with it . 341760_343940
*PAR0:	excuse me . 343940_345800
*PAR0:	and is there anything else that &-um that you'd want to tell me about his play or that you've noticed . 345800_351240
*PAR0:	lately coming up on too . 351240_354320
*PAR0:	I think he's got adorable you know whole routines for cooking and whole routines for the dolls . 354320_360600
*PAR0:	mhm . 360600_361260
*PAR0:	yeah he's been doing the cooking and the like bowls and like putting like feeding for a while . 361260_366820
*PAR0:	&-um otherwise he's just a big climber . 366820_370540
*PAR0:	we've we have a very small house . 370540_372340
*PAR0:	so there's not as much room for him to run around . 372340_374640
*PAR0:	he's gets more climbing . 374640_375800
*PAR0:	so he climbs all over the place . 375800_378160
*PAR0:	and he like we have gates . 378160_379960
*PAR0:	and he goes under one gate like it's like a cloth type of gate that stretches across the doorway . 379960_385660
*PAR0:	he goes under that . 385660_386720
*PAR0:	then we have a gate that's on the stairs . 386720_388700
*PAR0:	and he actually uses the outside of edge of the stairs to climb up holds on to the side . 388700_394540
*PAR0:	throws his leg over and jumps over like he's [/] he's a climber . 394540_398540
*PAR0:	so that's like a lot of his play is climbing on things <and jumping> [/] and jumping off of things . 398540_404720
*PAR0:	and he's pretty sure-footed though . 404720_409320
*PAR0:	and he's tough about it . 409320_411240
*PAR0:	he falls a lot . 411240_412500
*PAR0:	he falls a lot . 412500_413400
*PAR0:	he put himself together really nicely . 413400_415320
*PAR0:	but he makes sure like I [/] I do I don't usually run to him when . 415320_418820
*PAR0:	he first falls . 418820_419520
*PAR0:	he [/] he usually will cry when he really hurts himself . 419520_422880
*PAR0:	otherwise he just get gets back up and does exactly the same thing over again . 422880_427620
*PAR0:	he he's a tough little guy . 427620_430440
*PAR0:	do you have any questions for me . 430440_432220
