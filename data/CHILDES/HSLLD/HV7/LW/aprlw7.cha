@Comment:	MOT suggest that since she has read the book aloud to Chi so often in the past that Chi should now read the book to Mot. Chi reads through book pretty fluently , but omits a few words and makes pronunciation mistakes. Mot gently , but readily , corrects pronunciation as they go along. When writing letter , MOT dictates the entire content , and provides some support in spelling and layout. Chi reads the letter back. It's hard to tell which came first , Chi's being quiet or Mot's being controlling (though gentle and supportive).
