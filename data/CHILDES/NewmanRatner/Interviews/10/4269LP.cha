*PAR0:	and [/] and she [/] she loves [/] loves bread [/] bread with [/] with butter [/] butter on [/] on it [/] it . 136360_138160
*PAR0:	so [/] so &-um everything else . 138200_140720
*PAR0:	she kinda was like . 140720_141620
*PAR0:	eh whatever <I want the> [/] I want the stuff . 141620_143580
*PAR0:	I know . 143580_143920
*PAR0:	so does she play with &-um or do she play together with &-um baby dolls at home . 144160_150440
*PAR0:	a little bit . 150560_151320
*PAR0:	we only have &-um one baby doll . 151440_153720
*PAR0:	so &-um she plays with it a little bit but not that much . 154260_159180
*PAR0:	she &-um tends to try to play with things that are her brother's . 159240_165620
*PAR0:	so [/] so she &-um we have one baby doll because it actually is her brother's doll . 165780_173060
*PAR0:	&-um we gave it to him when we were expecting her kind of as like a preparatory like . 173540_180680
*PAR0:	okay you know you're getting a baby . 180680_182120
*PAR0:	you're gonna get we didn't know if it was gonna be a boy or a girl . 182280_184040
*PAR0:	so we said . 184420_185240
*PAR0:	you're gonna get a baby brother or sister . 185240_186840
*PAR0:	you know this is we wanted him to have I guess have something he could do when she arrived you know like because we were really busy changing her and feeding her and said . 187500_197560
*PAR0:	oh why don't you get you know he ended up naming it baby Steve go get baby Steve and you know you can change baby Steve or you can feed baby Steve while we're doing the same thing . 197560_206060
*PAR0:	so he had somebody to mimic . 206060_207480
*PAR0:	and &-um so he has baby Steve but now she the last month or two she's gotten interested in baby Steve and occasionally she'll wanna sit there and like hold the doll or you know look at it . 207480_221700
*PAR0:	and like more of like a friend not necessarily somebody to take care of . 221800_226880
*PAR0:	&-um like my son takes care of the baby doll . 227420_230240
*PAR0:	she looks at it as like . 230500_231580
*PAR0:	oh [/] oh it's a friend . 231580_232400
*PAR0:	and because the baby doll actually looks a lot like her . 232400_235960
*PAR0:	it's like it's dressed in blue . 235960_237500
*PAR0:	but it's got like bright blue eyes . 237500_238940
*PAR0:	and it's like fair hair and all this stuff . 238940_241300
*PAR0:	so it looks like her . 241300_242620
*PAR0:	so she thinks it's a friend to play with . 242620_245420
*PAR0:	but we have played kitchen stuff and food that she likes both the kids like to play together . 245420_252980
*PAR0:	and then she likes to go for his matchbox cars and his legos . 252980_257260
*PAR0:	and we always it's a challenge trying to keep her away from the legos . 257260_260380
*PAR0:	so Krishna allowed to have them yet . 260380_262600
*PAR0:	but it's what her brother does . 262600_264380
*PAR0:	so that she wants them . 264380_266020
*PAR0:	so we always tell him to get out if he's gonna get them out we say get out of your duplos too the big ones because she she's allowed to have the big . 266020_272900
*PAR0:	ones so because she can't swallow them . 272900_274960
*PAR0:	so &-um but she doesn't try to like feed the baby or play like any activities together just like . 274960_282620
*PAR0:	no . 282620_282980
*PAR0:	she likes to be around the baby like if like when we have other &-um play dates like a lot of &-uh <some of my> [/] some of my son's friends have baby siblings now sisters or brothers . 282980_294880
*PAR0:	and &-um she knows when the babies come over they kinda sit there . 295720_299060
*PAR0:	and they look at each other . 299060_300020
*PAR0:	and then they'll each play with a toy . 300720_302220
*PAR0:	and then they kinda look at each other . 302360_303620
*PAR0:	and it's kinda the same thing she does with the baby doll . 303620_305660
*PAR0:	is she kinda looks at it like . 306220_307540
*PAR0:	okay what are we gonna do . 307540_308720
*PAR0:	and then occasionally she'll be like . 308720_310480
*PAR0:	okay what let's do this . 310480_312660
*PAR0:	you know . 312660_313060
*PAR0:	&-um but she doesn't try to treat it as younger than her . 313060_318240
*PAR0:	she tries to seems like she treats us as a friend right now . 318420_321560
*PAR0:	&-um so that's all she does with dolls so far . 322480_327020
*PAR0:	so &-um I don't know if they'll we'll see if that changes or not or if she seems to like to try to do things her brother does . 327020_333520
*PAR0:	so . 333520_333880
*PAR0:	yeah she thinks she's a big shot when she gets to do similar things like I had her . 334140_338460
*PAR0:	&-um she's old enough now she's can sit up . 338460_340600
*PAR0:	so I always put them sometimes in shopping carts next to each other . 340600_343480
*PAR0:	if I get if we go to one of the grocery stores that has the seats that you can strap the both the two kids in . 343620_349600
*PAR0:	and she just thinks she's the best thing . 349600_352420
*PAR0:	so [/] so anything her brother does is what she wants to do . 352420_356020
*PAR0:	so &-um so . 356020_359380
*PAR0:	okay . 359380_359720
*PAR0:	well I think &-um you answered all my questions . 359720_363500
*PAR0:	okay . 363500_363980
*PAR0:	you were very clear I guess with &-uh yeah I mean I [/] I suppose the only thing is do you think overall there was &-um she knew the names of any of the toys that you may have brought . 363980_375100
*PAR0:	whether she played with them more or less . 375100_377020
*PAR0:	&-uh huh &-um I think she knows the names of some of the . 377040_382520
*PAR0:	yeah you're a cookie . 382520_384080
*PAR0:	&-um some of the [/] the things that she played with a lot . 384080_388840
*PAR0:	&-um like she knows at home . 388840_391860
*PAR0:	I know she knows like if I say you wanna let's do a book . 391860_394920
*PAR0:	&-um if she wants to she [/] <she knows> [/] she knows what a book is but she doesn't know a particular book I don't think . 394920_402880
*PAR0:	&-um and she knew if I said . 402880_405240
*PAR0:	oh look here's [/] here's some bread . 405240_406940
*PAR0:	she was like . 406940_408080
*PAR0:	oh bread or peas or pizza . 408080_410480
*PAR0:	she liked those . 410480_411680
*PAR0:	and I plate showed her a cup . 411680_414400
*PAR0:	she was interested in the cup for a little bit . 414400_416160
*PAR0:	but she's learning to drink out of a cup . 416160_417860
*PAR0:	but she hasn't figured out you can actually get something from a cup . 417860_421520
*PAR0:	so we're trying to get her to learn how to drink out of a cup because she was never &-um she always just nursed we had a really hard time . 421520_430040
*PAR0:	she never wanted a bottle . 430100_431140
*PAR0:	&-um so we're actually in this transition right now of trying to get her . 432160_435040
*PAR0:	we keep giving her a cup in hopes that she'll figure out that you can get something to drink out of this cup . 435180_439920
*PAR0:	because when she turns a year old she's gonna there's no more . 439920_443120
*PAR0:	she's [/] she's getting a cup . 443120_444220
*PAR0:	that's it no more . 444220_445060
*PAR0:	she's getting cut off . 445060_445980
*PAR0:	from nursing . 445980_446400
*PAR0:	so we keep working on giving her a cup . 446400_449340
*PAR0:	she hasn't figured out the whole how it works yet . 449340_453040
*PAR0:	so it's kind of like . 453040_454040
*PAR0:	oh this they gifted me this thing . 454040_456140
*PAR0:	but yeah [/] yeah . 456140_458400
*PAR0:	so &-um but and she does I don't think what else at home . 458400_464220
*PAR0:	I'll set up . 464220_465460
*PAR0:	&-um we have a bin of like stuffed animals like about this size that I'll put her in front . 465460_470700
*PAR0:	of . 470700_470840
*PAR0:	and sometimes [/] sometimes she wants to play with them . 470840_472760
*PAR0:	sometimes she doesn't they're not necessarily baby dolls but they're like dolls like animal dolls . 472760_478620
*PAR0:	&-um they have faces . 478660_480160
*PAR0:	and she gets times where she really likes them . 480160_482260
*PAR0:	but other times she doesn't really particularly care why the other &-um do you think what else . 482260_490100
*PAR0:	I was trying to ask her like she had she wanted to play with the peas and the cookie for a while at one point . 490240_496740
*PAR0:	and I was holding both of them . 497040_498580
*PAR0:	and I was asking her . 498580_499340
*PAR0:	do you want the peas or the cookie to try to see if she knew it cause peas were peas . 499340_504120
*PAR0:	she knew . 504120_504580
*PAR0:	and cookie was new . 504580_505540
*PAR0:	so I was trying to see if she got that she knew what the peas were . 506260_510520
*PAR0:	but this is something different . 510520_512500
*PAR0:	see if we come here a lot . 513120_516260
*PAR0:	so [/] so &-um and she didn't she seemed to just keep going for the piece . 516260_522180
*PAR0:	so I don't know if she knew that cookie was the new thing or not . 522300_526640
*PAR0:	so I don . 526860_528260
*PAR0:	but she seemed to have fun . 528260_530160
*PAR0:	so well that's the most important thing here . 530640_532820
*PAR0:	so . 533200_533660
*PAR0:	well thank you so much for coming in have &-uh like a good one but we have a schedule for . 534540_541140
*PAR0:	visit . 541140_541660
*PAR0:	so we don't necessarily have to do that today . 541660_543700
*PAR0:	but we'd like to give you a call about it . 543700_546180
*PAR0:	yeah . 546180_547000
*PAR0:	I was gonna ask was like it was like around a year I should say a year old about . 547000_551240
