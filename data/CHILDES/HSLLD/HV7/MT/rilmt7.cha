@Comment:	Chi , MOT , and Chi's older Bro are eating dinner. Mot is still preparing the meal when the tape starts. The television is on in the background during the whole meal. It seems like Mot and Chi eat at the kitchen table and Bro eats in front of the tv. Bro is only minimally involved in the conversations between Mot and Chi while the meal is still being prepared , and then is absent almost completely when he leaves to eat in front of the tv. Mot and Chi discuss Chi's lack of homework for school that day , a toy called splat that Chi wants , what Chi will do after dinner , and Chi sings a halloween song that she learned at daycare to Mot.
