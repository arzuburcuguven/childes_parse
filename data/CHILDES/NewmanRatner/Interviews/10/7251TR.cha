*PAR0:	can I ask you some questions now . 0_6040
*PAR0:	so what do you think . 6040_7420
*PAR0:	&-um his favorite thing was this time . 7420_11980
*PAR0:	overall I think he was kind of preoccupied with that clock for a while . 11980_17320
*PAR0:	okay . 18300_18600
*PAR0:	yeah . 18920_19160
*PAR0:	&-um in the beginning and then as you saw the end the spoon . 19160_23740
*PAR0:	&-um so I think the if I had to pick between the two I would say the clock kept his interest for a while . 24780_31920
*PAR0:	how was he playing with it . 32120_33780
*PAR0:	what [/] what do you think got his attention . 33840_35300
*PAR0:	I think he was just trying to figure out like trying to pull [/] pull it [/] it off [/] off . 35340_40020
*PAR0:	he's [/] he's the [/] the h hand minute [/] minute hands [/] hands and [/] and the our hour hands [/] hands . 40020_42920
*PAR0:	and [/] and just [/] just trying [/] trying to get a sense of it . 42920_44880
*PAR0:	probably felt a little different the texture the foaminess . 44880_47900
*PAR0:	so I think he was just trying to figure out how it might be different in terms of texture and whatnot is that different from last time . 47900_56440
*PAR0:	yeah I don't think that was here last time it was here was it . 57100_61600
*PAR0:	<he must not have> [/] he must not have . 61620_63180
*PAR0:	yeah . 63180_63380
*PAR0:	then he must not have just been interested in it . 63720_66060
*PAR0:	I think last time it was more the stuffed animals . 66400_68520
*PAR0:	mhm . 69100_69140
*PAR0:	and maybe now this is just something he hasn't really seen . 69140_72140
*PAR0:	so . 72640_73200
*PAR0:	yeah . 73200_73540
*PAR0:	how was he this time with the stuffed animals . 73800_75760
*PAR0:	I don't think he was as interested in the stuffed animals because <I was> [/] I was trying to last time the bee and whatnot I was showing him that . 76040_83720
*PAR0:	and he seemed to be a little bit more into that . 83720_85560
*PAR0:	mm this . 85740_85960
*PAR0:	time he was like . 85960_86520
*PAR0:	whatever you know . 86520_88300
*PAR0:	okay . 88860_89940
*PAR0:	yeah . 90340_90560
*PAR0:	so that's a difference . 90700_91380
*PAR0:	yeah . 91700_91920
*PAR0:	did you try to show him any other &-um stuffed animals this time or . 92160_95660
*PAR0:	yeah I did &-um I tried to show him as many of the objects as I could this time . 95680_100380
*PAR0:	because last time I think I focused more on the food . 100500_102560
*PAR0:	so I actually did the doll this time . 103040_105420
*PAR0:	&-um I saw this book I don't remember reading next to him last time . 106280_110980
*PAR0:	so I was trying to pick out different objects compared to last time . 111340_115120
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah do you th what do you think is like . 115780_119560
*PAR0:	one of the bigger differences between last time and this time terms of his interest . 119560_123960
*PAR0:	mhm . 124340_124420
*PAR0:	he's very Curi more curious now than last time . 124480_127400
*PAR0:	definitely . 127940_129040
*PAR0:	&-um and he's like that everywhere he goes . 129960_132360
*PAR0:	I mean he's just into like getting into things . 132540_135400
*PAR0:	mhm . 135660_135860
*PAR0:	I mean we have toys in our living room . 135980_137920
*PAR0:	and he will go tamper with the wireless or the cable box . 137920_143080
*PAR0:	I mean whatever that's unique . 143220_145820
*PAR0:	he wants to play with them . 145820_147100
*PAR0:	mm . 147120_147280
*PAR0:	hmm . 147280_147440
*PAR0:	so was there anything about you said last time you played a lot with a toy with a food . 147780_153960
*PAR0:	mm . 154220_154420
*PAR0:	hmm . 154420_154480
*PAR0:	so was there anything this time that was different or even the same . 154540_157700
*PAR0:	anything to comment about the foods this time . 157800_160000
*PAR0:	&-um not really I mean he it seemed like the one of the first things he picked up was the one of the food items . 160640_168920
*PAR0:	&-um so I guess you know for whatever reason I guess whatever the plastic the texture . 169600_177380
*PAR0:	the colors whatever it is . 177380_179000
*PAR0:	he seems to be into that . 179000_180540
*PAR0:	&-um but it I don't think it was any different than last time . 181620_184940
*PAR0:	I think he was into playing with that those items as well . 185060_188100
*PAR0:	mm . 188400_188540
*PAR0:	hm . 188540_188680
*PAR0:	yeah . 189000_189220
*PAR0:	&-um how about &-uh is has he is he still on formula or is he . 190140_196040
*PAR0:	okay . 196180_196420
*PAR0:	so he hasn't tried like tape our food table food . 196880_200020
*PAR0:	and yes he does . 200020_200980
*PAR0:	okay . 201280_201440

*PAR0:	he does up to stage four baby food . 202860_205940
*PAR0:	he does table food . 206040_207240
*PAR0:	&-um the pediatrician actually said to us three or four months ago . 207900_212420
*PAR0:	he can pretty much eat anything . 212420_214000
*PAR0:	cool . 214380_214680
*PAR0:	&-um so we I haven't really I didn't really introduce him to that necessarily four months ago because I still kinda was like . 215220_223480
*PAR0:	oh it's kinda early . 223480_224380
*PAR0:	mhm . 224520_224680
*PAR0:	and he didn't really have enough teeth to really grind on the food . 224780_227800
*PAR0:	now we [/] we pretty much have given him table [/] table along with baby food . 228080_233800
*PAR0:	so what is he used to . 234020_235620
*PAR0:	what is he usually eating or he like &-um he pretty much he's good about eating it . 235680_241120
*PAR0:	anything . 241520_242160
*PAR0:	I try to give him as much as I can . 242620_244860
*PAR0:	the veggies and the fruits . 244860_246280
*PAR0:	&-um . 247280_247520

*PAR0:	I'm trying to see what he's so excited about . 266760_270040
*PAR0:	I'm like . 270200_270380
*PAR0:	you like the computer . 270920_271900
*PAR0:	you like <the computer> [/] the computer . 272200_277780
*PAR0:	yes . 278820_279400
*PAR0:	yes . 280200_281220
*PAR0:	we have one of those . 281220_282220
*PAR0:	yes . 283720_284620
*PAR0:	but you can't type on that . 284620_286000
*PAR0:	yes . 287080_289640
*PAR0:	I know it's exciting . 289740_292440
*PAR0:	but yeah . 293380_295360
*PAR0:	&-um we give him a lot of Veggies and [/] and &-uh some of the baby food I have has meat in it now like chicken and rice . 295360_303380
*PAR0:	mhm . 303520_303640
*PAR0:	<that type of> [/] that type of thing . 303660_304480
*PAR0:	Turkey but &-um I'm trying my best to keep him consistently eating veggies and fruits because you know the kids once they get the sugar stuff . 304600_314060
*PAR0:	that's it . 314060_314520
*PAR0:	yeah sweets . 314580_316460
*PAR0:	it's just they don't really care for the veggies anymore . 316460_319620
*PAR0:	so that's a great point . 319900_321120
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah that's like the first preference taste right . 321800_326840
*PAR0:	so sugar . 326840_328520
*PAR0:	so the foods that we have out here are do you think he was familiar with the ones that you talk you played with [/] with him or &-um . 329920_340100
*PAR0:	I don't know if he is or not . 340100_344360
*PAR0:	I can't say if he is or not . 345620_349760
*PAR0:	okay . 350080_350340
*PAR0:	like I don't think he's familiar with you know the spaghetti . 351440_354760
*PAR0:	I don't think he has peas . 354960_356040
*PAR0:	I think he sh should be . 356360_358180
*PAR0:	but I'm not sure if he is because he eats that pretty often . 358180_361580
*PAR0:	mm . 362020_362220
*PAR0:	hm &-um but I'm not sure . 362220_365900
*PAR0:	okay . 366900_367340
*PAR0:	yeah . 367600_367820
*PAR0:	&-uh and then you said you do are you guys reading books at home . 368760_372080
*PAR0:	yes . 372100_372380
*PAR0:	<are any> [/] are any of them similar to the ones we have . 372720_376300
*PAR0:	yes . 376300_376340
*PAR0:	actually we have good night moon . 376520_378980
*PAR0:	mm . 379160_379320
*PAR0:	hm . 379320_379420
*PAR0:	&-um and that's one where we read pr pretty often the foot book . 379580_385740
*PAR0:	we have this as well . 385740_387300
*PAR0:	so these are the these books I saw when I came in so . 387420_389880
*PAR0:	I purposely didn't read this . 389880_391280
*PAR0:	I don't have this one . 391520_392520
*PAR0:	put me in the zoo . 392520_393320
*PAR0:	but &-um yeah we try to read to him before bedtime . 394160_397320
*PAR0:	oh so he likes it . 397880_399240
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 399480_399940
*PAR0:	yeah . 399940_400260
*PAR0:	he likes books . 400440_401260
*PAR0:	oh great . 401540_401980
*PAR0:	so you said you purposely avoided the ones that you knew he already had . 405260_408640
*PAR0:	so does he like variety more than repetition or is it more for yourself or I think it's more for myself . 408680_414340
*PAR0:	okay . 414700_414900
*PAR0:	I can't really speak for him . 414980_416220
*PAR0:	I know you wanna say it but I can't really say it for him but for myself . 416640_421060
*PAR0:	reading Goodnight Moon for probably fifteen plus times . 421880_426880
*PAR0:	I was just like . 426880_428160
*PAR0:	okay I'm not gonna read that one again . 428160_430180
*PAR0:	mm . 430500_430560
*PAR0:	hmm . 430560_430820
*PAR0:	kind of like <a new> [/] a new book . 431220_433620
*PAR0:	aw . 433940_434240
*PAR0:	but &-um yeah . 434620_436660
*PAR0:	&-uh we &-um we try to [/] to give him some different books to you know I think mainly for us . 436980_444480
*PAR0:	we just liked variety . 444780_446380
*PAR0:	makes sense to me . 447960_449160
*PAR0:	yeah . 449400_449420
*PAR0:	he gets old pretty fast . 449680_452460
*PAR0:	yeah . 452580_452800
*PAR0:	does he have any like favorite parts of books . 453040_455240
*PAR0:	you know books that have are more interactive or have re like repetition with them in them . 455360_459920
*PAR0:	yeah . 459920_460100
*PAR0:	he actually I don't know if it's the repetition of the words I think the books that are kind of &-um cut out in terms of shapes . 460100_469280
*PAR0:	like he's got a Bob the builder Wrench book . 469280_471720
*PAR0:	loves that book because it's shaped as a wrench . 472360_475440
*PAR0:	so he likes to kind of feel it and touch it . 476040_479080
*PAR0:	and [/] and you know play with the pages and stuff because I think it's just a different feel . 479080_484660
*PAR0:	mm . 484940_485060
*PAR0:	hm . 485060_485180
*PAR0:	for him . 485440_486020
*PAR0:	so he loves that book . 486520_487820
*PAR0:	he's he loves it so much . 487900_489180
*PAR0:	the book is now ripped in half . 489180_490500
*PAR0:	aw because he's picked it up so many times . 490640_493080
*PAR0:	and like you know kind of played with it and ripped it . 493080_496980
*PAR0:	and so yeah so that's actually his favorite I think his favorite book . 496980_500740
*PAR0:	&-uh huh &-um is he using I'm sorry . 500960_504140
*PAR0:	I'm switching subjects . 504140_504900
*PAR0:	&-uh c cause &-uh seeing him with a spoon makes me . 505180_507200
*PAR0:	I wanted to know . 507200_508260
*PAR0:	is he when he's eating is he using &-um utensils and cups . 508260_511640
*PAR0:	and or is he still on bottles . 511640_512920
*PAR0:	and yeah . 512920_513640
*PAR0:	so we actually switched him to sippy cups and &-um &-uh like a plastic bottle with a straw in it about a month ago . 513800_520940
*PAR0:	so we're trying to kind of switch him over from bottle to that . 521380_524580
*PAR0:	and then &-um I've been feeding him with like a spoon for the past three or four months now . 525080_530640
*PAR0:	okay . 530760_530960
*PAR0:	so when I feed him table food he's [/] he's [/] he's used to being fed with a spoon . 531260_536440
*PAR0:	&-um sometimes he'll try to grab for it the actual spoon . 537320_540340
*PAR0:	but we kind of are hesitant with him picking the spoon because the food is all over the place . 540820_545820
*PAR0:	but he does try ta grab for the spoon and [/] and pull it . 545920_548720
*PAR0:	mhm . 548840_549040
*PAR0:	and I don't know if he's trying ta put it in his mouth . 549160_550920
*PAR0:	I don't really think he has the coordination yet to do that . 550960_553760
*PAR0:	's attempting to try to grab for this food when you have the food in it to get it . 553760_559540
*PAR0:	oh that's great . 559680_560260
*PAR0:	and I think that he with his sitter his older . 561080_565280
*PAR0:	cousin's there as well . 565280_566320
*PAR0:	and she's about eight months older than him . 566320_568280
*PAR0:	and I think she's kind of doing that kind of stuff with him like she can feed herself . 568820_573720
*PAR0:	but she also tries to feed him . 574280_576060
*PAR0:	and he's like watching her . 576460_578860
*PAR0:	and I think he's trying to imitate her as well . 579140_582420
*PAR0:	so I think neat . 582860_583400
*PAR0:	that's another reason why he's like trying to attempt to pick up the spoon and use it because he sees her . 583620_589780
*PAR0:	and he's trying imitate her . 589780_591040
*PAR0:	that's awesome . 591200_591740
*PAR0:	so yeah little steps right . 593380_596040
*PAR0:	I know it helps when they [/] they have you know a model like another child a little bit older than them because I [/] I find that he's picking up things a little bit faster being around her . 596280_605960
*PAR0:	oh that's great . 606380_607260
*PAR0:	yeah . 607340_607500
*PAR0:	&-um and then the other thing I was made a note about is you said you played with a doll was that new or . 608840_614500
*PAR0:	yeah . 614520_614740
*PAR0:	&-um at my sitter's house she also has dolls as well . 615000_619460
*PAR0:	and with a female little girl she plays with dolls and stuff like that . 619680_623760
*PAR0:	so I think he does play with dolls . 623840_625800
*PAR0:	but this time around I was like . 625980_627580
*PAR0:	well let me show him the doll . 627580_629140
*PAR0:	and we recently he's starting to say . 629260_631540
*PAR0:	baby . 631540_631940
*PAR0:	mm . 631940_632420
*PAR0:	so I was trying to say . 632420_633540
*PAR0:	baby like you recognize baby . 633540_636140
*PAR0:	but &-um he was like . 636140_638840
*PAR0:	huh yeah . 638840_639660
*PAR0:	okay . 640900_641940
*PAR0:	he can he found paper on top of that . 642460_647220
*PAR0:	didn't you smarty the toys . 647220_651260
*PAR0:	and you're trying to play with the paper . 651660_652880
*PAR0:	&-um I'm gonna go back there . 653120_657240
*PAR0:	so the playing with the dolls do . 658720_660460
*PAR0:	you know how he plays with the dolls or I guess how does he play with it here or how he's playing with it at the &-um I think he's just pretty much kind of looking at it . 660460_669760
*PAR0:	and then he'll like touch it . 670100_671720
*PAR0:	and as you could see he was trying to remove the hat because he's not a big fan of hats . 672320_676160
*PAR0:	&-uh and then he removed the shoe . 676460_679800
*PAR0:	so mainly you know just trying to just kind of feeling it . 680040_683880
*PAR0:	and that's about it . 683880_684680
*PAR0:	I don't think he's aggressive with it . 684760_686360
*PAR0:	like banging it or anything like that . 686360_689360
*PAR0:	<not yet> [/] not yet he does that with other toys . 689360_693540
*PAR0:	does he really . 694040_694640
*PAR0:	yeah . 694840_695040
*PAR0:	oh no . 695260_695720
*PAR0:	you know what I think is this my microphone . 695720_698460
*PAR0:	you know what we'll just have to . 698780_699880
*PAR0:	nope I think I disconnected it this way . 700100_703340
*PAR0:	that's exactly what happened . 703440_704740
*PAR0:	oh no you're okay . 704900_706380
*PAR0:	but we have the camera on . 707020_708520
*PAR0:	so don't worry . 708520_709140
*PAR0:	okay . 709280_709500
*PAR0:	&-uh about that . 710060_711300
*PAR0:	you don't have to worry about this though . 711700_712680
*PAR0:	&-um so I think is there anything else like new or [/] or different from last time . 713260_720120
*PAR0:	&-um I just think that you know now that he's getting older . 721200_724860
*PAR0:	he's just and he's more mobile . 724860_726640
*PAR0:	he's more into everything . 727620_729220
*PAR0:	last time . 729580_730740
*PAR0:	he was pretty much just sitting here . 730740_732380
*PAR0:	now he can crawl he can cruise . 732880_734700
*PAR0:	so if it's open and it's not blocked off it's fair game in terms of him touching and getting into it . 734700_743120
*PAR0:	so [/] so that's pretty much what's new . 744040_746620
*PAR0:	well he did a really good job of sitting in the circle with all the you know . 747400_750980
*PAR0:	yeah . 751160_751300
*PAR0:	I [/] I mean I surprisingly he was interested in what was around him . 751520_755620
*PAR0:	I [/] I was hoping you wouldn't crawl over and start grabbing wires and whatnot . 756060_759860
*PAR0:	yeah that would &-uh well we would have been on it . 760340_763680
*PAR0:	were there's three of us here today . 763860_765400
*PAR0:	so we could have figured it out . 765620_767660
*PAR0:	but I think that's all I have for you . 768200_770040
