*PAR0:	we have a lot of baby doll stuff . 171680_172620
*PAR0:	and usually she likes to play with the [/] the baby dolls . 172880_174400
*PAR0:	but she usually she likes to push them in the shopping cart you know and put them in the heat chairs and feed them and that kind of stuff . 174400_179660
*PAR0:	so we have some of the bigger more interactive parts versus we don't have like all . 179660_183380
*PAR0:	we don't undress them and dress them a whole lot . 183380_185280

*PAR0:	just kind of stay in the clothes they're already in or their clothes come off . 186800_189200
*PAR0:	and then they're naked . 189200_189760
*PAR0:	yeah you have some naked babies . 189760_191480
*PAR0:	so she doesn't usually dress them too much . 191480_194560
*PAR0:	so I was wondering if she would get into that with me or not you know but she didn't seem to [/] to be too interested in what clothes they wear . 194560_200840
*PAR0:	we have like a whole bin of plastic animals . 201300_203160
*PAR0:	but we don't have like anything like this which is really cool for them to interact with it on . 203160_207680
