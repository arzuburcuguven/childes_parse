@Date:	11-SEP-1993
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	www .
%sit:	EXP introduces magnet activity and explains that she'll be videotaping Mot's and Chi's hands .
@Comment:	Time is 19:42. Video tape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play well throughout the activity. Bro is only superficially included; he seems too young to follow everything. EXP remains in the background , offering occasional encouragement or laughing. There is a substantial amount of experimentation with the magnets. Mot and Chi spend a lot of time experimenting with magnets that repel each other and testing the magnetic qualities of different types of matter. Mot makes a few attempts to give a scientific explanation for what happens , but then stops mid-sentence saying she doesn't really know the reasoning behind it all.
*CHI:	www .
*BRO:	www .
*MOT:	www .
*INV:	www .
%com:	Chi and Bro play with magnets while Mot and EXP set up room for videotaping and discuss if it's okay for Bro to play also; Mot decides it will be easier to let Bro play
*CHI:	hey !
@Comment:	Time is 21:17
*CHI:	&~th this guy's kind [?] magnet .
*CHI:	look .
*BRO:	Chi can I try ?
*MOT:	think so .
*MOT:	what's the magnets in ?
*CHI:	what [>] ?
*MOT:	well [<] this must have a magnet on it right ?
*MOT:	(be)cause all this stuff stickin(g) [>] it to it .
*CHI:	yeah [<] .
*CHI:	it is a magnet .
*MOT:	see if the penny sticks .
*CHI:	0 [=! heavy sigh] .
*CHI:	nothing else does .
*CHI:	hey Bro .
%com:	video tape starts here
%sit:	MOT , Chi , and Bro are on the floor in a semi-circle with the magnets spread out in the middle of the semi- circle
*CHI:	where's the xxx ?
*CHI:	where's the pennies ?
*MOT:	these things [= referent unclear] I can't even pry them [= referent unclear] off .
*MOT:	(.) see if this [= plastic turtle] will stick to the magnet [= black base] .
*MOT:	is this [= yellow wand] a magnet in here ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*CHI:	it's [= yellow wand] a magnet .
*CHI:	see ?
%act:	holds yellow wand over nuts and washers , and nuts and washers stick to the yellow wand
*MOT:	what happens ?
*MOT:	oh yeah .
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	what happens if you put the yellow [= yellow wand] on top of the mirror [= flat silver circle] ?
%com:	the flat silver circle is on the black base
*MOT:	wait .
%add:	BRO
%sit:	BRO is placing the turtle on the black base , MOT and Chi want to see what happens when the yellow wand is placed on the flat silver circle which is on the black base
*CHI:	alright now .
*CHI:	+^ move .
%add:	BRO
*BRO:	whoa [>] !
*MOT:	get that [= plastic turtle] [<] out_of the way .
%act:	moves turtle off of black base
*BRO:	whoa !
*CHI:	it pushes !
%sit:	Chi is holding yellow wand over the black base; they repel each other
*CHI:	mom feel it [= repulsion of yellow wand and black base] .
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	no wonder .
%act:	removes two marbles which are stuck on the underside of the yellow wand
%com:	this apparently fixes something , though the situation isn't clear enough to determine what
*INV:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	oh it [= yellow wand and black base] pushes so cool .
*CHI:	look !
%act:	hands yellow wand to Mot
*MOT:	oh yeah .
%act:	holds yellow wand over black base , feeling the repulsion through the yellow wand
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	takes yellow wand back from Mot; then demonstrates how to hold the wand over the black base for Bro
*CHI:	Bro [/] Bro just go like this .
*CHI:	oh not [/] not [/] not like that .
%sit:	wand sticks to black base this time; it doesn't seem to be repelled
*CHI:	just go like this lightly .
%act:	demonstrates again
*BRO:	here try this one [= blue ball] [>] .
%act:	picks up blue marble
*MOT:	turn [<] it [= yellow wand] over .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	turns the black base over
*MOT:	no .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	turn that [= the yellow wand] [!] over .
%act:	points to yellow wand in Chi's hand
*CHI:	<hold it> [= wait] .
%act:	removes washer from the black base
%sit:	BRO is trying to get the yellow wand from Chi's hands; Chi wants to feel the repulsion again without the washer , or anything else , on the black base; Chi doesn't want Bro to use the yellow wand yet
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	+^ <hold it> [= wait] .
%add:	BRO
%sit:	BRO tries to take the yellow wand from Chi again
*CHI:	I didn't think I did .
*CHI:	&=vocalization .
*CHI:	Bro &~g &~g &~g go like this .
%act:	holds yellow wand over black base
*CHI:	it [= the yellow wand and the black base] pushes .
%act:	gives yellow wand to Bro
*CHI:	do it [= hold yellow wand over black base to feel repulsion] .
*CHI:	no .
%sit:	BRO holds yellow wand too far away from black base
*MOT:	turn it this way .
%act:	guides Bro's hand so that he's holding yellow wand closer to the black base
*CHI:	no .
%sit:	BRO lets yellow wand drop to the side of the black base; Chi guides Bro's hand so that Bro is holding yellow wand over the the silver circle which lies on top of the black base
%com:	the yellow wand apparently sticks to the part of the black base which is not covered by the flat silver circle , but is repelled by the black base with the silver circle on top of it
*MOT:	see [/] see if you can stick [!] it [= yellow wand] on there [= the silver circle on top of the black base] .
*MOT:	try to press it [= yellow wand] down on there [= the silver circle on top of the black base] .
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*BRO:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	see if you can do it [= make yellow wand stick to the silver circle on the black base] .
*MOT:	see if you can force it [= the yellow wand] down [= onto silver circle on black base] .
*CHI:	okay .
%act:	grabs hold of yellow wand in Bro's hand
*CHI:	let me see .
%act:	removes yellow wand from Bro's hand
*BRO:	hey !
*BRO:	how (a)bout that [= silver stick] ?
%act:	picks up silver stick
*CHI:	no not that [= silver stick] .
*CHI:	worked .
%act:	forces yellow wand onto black base; black base sticks to yellow wand
*MOT:	huh .
*CHI:	so cool .
*CHI:	so [>] +...
*BRO:	can [<] I +...
%com:	<$=4> video camera is directed away from the activity and participants' actions cannot be seen
*CHI:	so +...
*CHI:	so then if you do it [= referent unclear] this way +//.
*CHI:	Bro stop .
*CHI:	+, if you do it [= referent unclear] this way <it push> [//] it [= referent unclear] pushes it [= referent unclear] up .
*CHI:	(.) hey .
*CHI:	what if +...
*BRO:	Chi look !
%act:	holds up a washer and a nut which have been magnetized
%sit:	the washer and nut are attracted to each other and so the nut hangs from the washer
*BRO:	Chi !
*CHI:	if [/] if you do it [= hold yellow wand over black base] +...
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	if you do it <this way> [>] +...
%act:	holds the yellow wand over the black base with a certain side directly over the black base
*BRO:	<xxx Chi> [<] .
*MOT:	no [=? mom] .
*CHI:	+, it [//] if you do it this way it [= yellow wand] willn't [//] like pushes [!] it [= black base] down [>] .
%act:	holds yellow wand over the black base with the side to which Chi refers closest to the base; yellow wand and black base repel each other
*MOT:	yeah [<] .
*CHI:	if you turn it [= yellow wand] the other way it [= yellow wand] sticks immediately .
%act:	turns over the yellow wand; now , yellow wand and black base are attracted to each other
*MOT:	huh .
*BRO:	hey guys [>] !
*MOT:	<on that side [= of yellow wand]> [<] +...
*BRO:	Ma [>] !
*MOT:	if [<] both sides [= of yellow wand] are magnetized +//.
*MOT:	<see I don't know anything about it [= attraction and repulsion capabilities of the yellow wand]> [>] .
*BRO:	<take a break> [<] !
*BRO:	say ah .
*MOT:	see I don't know why that [//] what the principle is .
*BRO:	mom !
*CHI:	watch this .
%act:	moves yellow wand over nuts and washers , which are on the floor , and they cling to the yellow wand
*CHI:	a [/] a vacuum cleaner .
*INV:	hm: hm: .
*MOT:	does this one [= small rectangular piece] got a magnet on it ?
%add:	BRO
*MOT:	try that one [= small rectangular piece] .
%act:	hands small rectangular piece to Bro
*CHI:	oh it [= small rectangular piece] does ?
*CHI:	here .
*CHI:	lemme [: let me] see [= small rectangular piece] .
*CHI:	I wanna <test something out> [>] .
*BRO:	<it's [= referent unclear] a magnet> [<] .
%com:	probably refers to the rectangular piece , but Bro is not pictured on the video now
*CHI:	if it [= rectangular piece] pushes away with those metal things [= Bro's pieces] maybe it [= rectangular piece] can push away with this [= yellow wand] .
%sit:	MOT reaches over to get black base and Bro picks it up instead
*MOT:	okay .
*MOT:	+^ <put it [= the black base] over here [= on the floor in the middle of the three participants]> [>] .
*CHI:	right [<] ?
*MOT:	put it [= the black base] in the middle [= of Chi , MOT , and Bro] .
*CHI:	but &~w where's the turtle guy [= the plastic turtle] ?
*BRO:	yeah !
%act:	puts black base magnet on the floor where Mot had indicated and places rectangular piece on top of the black base magnet
*CHI:	&~th this [= the plastic turtle] got a magnet ?
%act:	taps plastic turtle with yellow wand to see if they stick to each other
*MOT:	no .
*CHI:	now &~w &~w +...
*MOT:	but these [= the balls] have magnets in it .
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	but you can kind of feel it [= yellow wand] pushin(g) (th)em [= blue ball] away [>] a little bit .
*BRO:	<try this [= flat square magnet]> [<] .
*MOT:	try it .
%sit:	Chi has removed yellow wand , but Mot still holds blue marble over black base and she still feels repulsion
*BRO:	xxx .
%act:	puts flat square magnet onto black blase and then removes it
*MOT:	part of it's [= repulsion] (be)cause it's +...
*CHI:	yeah .
*CHI:	it [= blue ball and yellow wand] does <push away> [>] .
%sit:	MOT holds blue marble over the yellow wand which is in Chi's hand
*BRO:	<oh cool> [<] .
%act:	picks up a silver man
*CHI:	<hey &~l &~l &~l &~l &~l &~l let's do this> [>] .

*CHI:	ugh !
*CHI:	can't get it [= something on the yellow wand] off .
*BRO:	can I try now ?
%com:	it's unclear what Bro wants to try exactly , but Mot and Chi are working on removing objects from the yellow wand and the black base
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	+^ oh .
*CHI:	what was that [= strange noise] ?
*INV:	&=laughs .
*INV:	I don't know .
*CHI:	got it [= black base] .
%act:	Chi takes black base from Mot who was trying to remove nuts , washers , marbles and other pieces from the black base
*CHI:	let me take it [= black base] mom .
*CHI:	(.) gosh .
%sit:	bef black base drops suddenly out of Chi's hands
*CHI:	it [= black base] doesn't let me do anything (.) except +...
%sit:	Chi is having trouble removing things from the black base with the yellow wand in his hand
*MOT:	(.) which one's [= yellow wand or the black base] more powerful [!] ?
*MOT:	like if one [= any magnet] was stuck on here [= black base] that one [= yellow wand] wouldn't be able to pick it [= magnet] up right ?
*CHI:	&~w yeah &~w I +...
%act:	sets yellow wand on the floor , picks up black base and begins removing the objects from the black base
*BRO:	Chi I'll try it .

*MOT:	but I don't think it [= yellow wand] will .
*MOT:	(.) nope .
%sit:	a nut is on top of the black base and Chi tries to pick up just the nut with the yellow wand; instead , the nut and the black base are lifted , and Chi holds everything up in the air for a while
*MOT:	hm: .
*BRO:	&=laughs .
*BRO:	look !
*INV:	&=laughs .
*BRO:	can I try ?
%com:	BRO wants to try lifting up the nut and black base with the yellow wand

%act:	tries to pick up nut with the yellow wand
*CHI:	this side [= of the yellow wand] can't do it [= pick up the nut from the black base] .
%act:	separates nut and the yellow wand , and taps the black base
*CHI:	let's try the other side [= of the yellow wand] .
*CHI:	(.) hey !
%sit:	the yellow wand picks up the nut off the black base
*MOT:	hey !
*MOT:	maybe (be)cause you tapped it [= black base] ?
