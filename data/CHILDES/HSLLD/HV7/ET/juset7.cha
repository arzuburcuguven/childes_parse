@Comment:	MOT plays an extremely minor role throughout this activity. EXP even has to ask her to come and play with the Chi in the beginning. EXP , alternatively , plays a key role in encouraging science talk; she asks about the magnetic force and engages Chi in an experiment to try and break it. Aside from this , Chi mostly plays with the magnets , picking up various objects. The atmosphere seems warm; though Mot doesn't talk much , she laughs at intervals. Video does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
