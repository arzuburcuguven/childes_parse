@Comment:	Chi writes the letter independently while the Mot and EXP converse; EXP's instructions were not recorded; Chi asks Mot a few questions relating to the the letter and also periodically interjects comments into their conversation. Chi complains that he can't write c@l-s very well. Mot says <do the best you can. Don't expect to be perfect>. The c@l-s looked fine , though Chi had erased and tried again. The beginning of the the tape is background conversation
