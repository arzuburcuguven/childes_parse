*PAR1:	oh Brian has thrown away a toy that Mark wants . 2503465_2507565
*PAR1:	my thoughts were I think that Brian may have thrown away a very good toy into the garbage when he could have given it to Goodwill . 2508025_2518085
*PAR2:	okay . 2518795_2519085

*PAR1:	and everything was cool . 2522745_2523765
*PAR1:	and I didn't understand why such a classy toy was in the garbage . 2523945_2528045
*PAR1:	and had it been fully explored . 2528145_2530765
*PAR1:	and as I pulled it apart I discovered that no that they actually worked . 2531025_2534645
*PAR1:	and why not give it to Goodwill okay . 2534645_2537405
*PAR2:	now do you wanna hear daddy's side of the story . 2537985_2539645

*PAR2:	okay . 2560515_2560805
*PAR3:	because he could've mom was right . 2560955_2563205
*PAR3:	he could've played in it to Goodwill and he thought that I didn't want it . 2563385_2568525
*PAR3:	okay . 2569035_2569325
*PAR3:	well that which I just thought I didn't . 2569325_2570485
*PAR3:	that . 2570555_2570845
*PAR2:	was true . 2570845_2571045
*PAR2:	daddy wasn't about . 2571045_2571605
*PAR3:	that I really that really just &-uh made a very [/] very [/] very big mistake . 2571915_2578365
*PAR3:	yeah . 2578475_2578765

*PAR2:	yeah . 2582795_2583085
*PAR2:	okay . 2583355_2583645
*PAR2:	here's what I was complaining about . 2583645_2585285
*PAR2:	I was complaining that after we've disposed of toys then things should be discussed between the parents outside of the child being present . 2586005_2595445
*PAR2:	and I was unhappy that the issue was brought up when Mark was around . 2596945_2599965
*PAR1:	okay . 2601235_2601525
*PAR1:	okay . 2601755_2602045
*PAR1:	my answer to that is simply that I thought you two were in agreement that there was nothing underhanded going on there . 2602065_2607725
*PAR1:	I did not assume something underhanded . 2607885_2609765
*PAR1:	always the bad toys . 2609765_2610405
*PAR1:	I assumed something simply that these people make a made a misjudgment upon a toy . 2610645_2615925
*PAR1:	assuming that it was broken when it was really a non broken toy which could go to Goodwill okay . 2616325_2622845
*PAR1:	not that it shouldn't be taken out of the house . 2624425_2627845
*PAR1:	it's fine with me . 2627915_2628765
*PAR1:	I just thought it should go to children who could use it . 2628925_2632245
*PAR2:	okay . 2633395_2633685
*PAR2:	well have you heard my point of view . 2633685_2634965
*PAR3:	yeah . 2635355_2635645
*PAR3:	so what do you . 2636425_2637205
*PAR2:	have to say about what I had to say . 2637205_2638165
*PAR3:	now . 2638825_2639045
*PAR3:	okay . 2639675_2639965
*PAR3:	well if . 2640115_2640525
*PAR1:	if I were to come to daddy when the boy wasn't around . 2640905_2644725
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 2644815_2645165
*PAR1:	and he would talk to me about that issue . 2647195_2649295
*PAR1:	uhhuh . 2649385_2649735
*PAR1:	he would actually answer and not run off and not be I would . 2650235_2653455
