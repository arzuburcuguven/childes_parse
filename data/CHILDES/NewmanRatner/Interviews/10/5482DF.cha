*PAR0:	and I think he was much more into it . 44120_46100
*PAR0:	I think just he kind of gets books more now than he did before . 46100_49780
*PAR0:	so he was more interested this time . 49780_51680

*PAR0:	he's really into the keys and the sound not as much the biting . 56140_61400
*PAR0:	you know now he's so focused on biting . 61400_62780
*PAR0:	so anything he can bite is good . 62780_64080
*PAR0:	&-um I think we did do a puppet or something . 64860_68060
*PAR0:	but recently just in life I think he's really into puppets . 69180_72300
*PAR0:	he's like getting that too . 72320_73520
*PAR0:	so I think . 73680_74460

*PAR0:	so do you have puppets at home . 80140_81720

*PAR0:	and we only have that one . 89000_92460

*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 95120_96820
*PAR0:	okay . 96820_97380
*PAR0:	he was giggling was he yeah how about any of the other stuffed animals . 97380_103600
*PAR0:	&-um I [/] I used this one also . 103600_106380
*PAR0:	and he was just as interested . 106380_108080
*PAR0:	same . 108080_108600
*PAR0:	okay . 108600_109620
*PAR0:	&-um so you don't think it was the difference in animals . 109620_112120
*PAR0:	I don't think so I think it could be anything you think any of those could . 112120_118700
*PAR0:	yeah . 118700_119580
*PAR0:	okay . 119580_120600
*PAR0:	&-um was he interested in those last time this kind of animals he I [/] I do remember him . 120600_126740
*PAR0:	being into the stuffed animals . 126740_127680
*PAR0:	but I think it not for the same reason . 127680_130260
*PAR0:	I think maybe he was biting them or something . 130260_132320
*PAR0:	yeah . 132320_132800
*PAR0:	yeah . 132800_133080
*PAR0:	okay . 133080_134000
*PAR0:	and how about books . 135080_137900
*PAR0:	&-um last time you said he was not so interested in that one last time . 137900_142100
*PAR0:	right . 142100_142320
*PAR0:	and &-um I think I read another one too . 142320_145860
*PAR0:	but I remember the book being sort of like he was like sitting there going through the motions . 145860_148920
*PAR0:	but it wasn't like anything exciting . 148920_150620
*PAR0:	but this time he was really into it especially this one . 150620_154440
*PAR0:	why do you think you liked that one I guess because of the Peekaboo thing . 154440_157700
*PAR0:	and we do play Peekaboo so he's used to that name <you know> [/] you know the word . 157700_162920
*PAR0:	okay . 162920_163160
*PAR0:	so he would recognize the word then right uh-huh I think too though like that's kind of cool that reveal you know . 163160_170260
*PAR0:	yeah . 170260_171460
*PAR0:	so maybe there's something to that [/] that maybe there is . 171460_174340
*PAR0:	okay . 174340_174720
*PAR0:	something like that . 174720_175720

*PAR0:	&-um this time was he interested in any of that stuff . 190360_193860
*PAR0:	the measuring spoons definitely &-um probably because of the noise and the biteability of it . 194460_201400
*PAR0:	&-um and then the bottle and the cup . 202220_204120
*PAR0:	he definitely tried to use them both as real objects . 204120_207440
