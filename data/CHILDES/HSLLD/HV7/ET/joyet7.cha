@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	want you guys to play with that together for about (.) ten minutes .
@Comment:	Time is 9:25
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play together; both seem to take turns directing activities and within each activity the turn taking is shared. There is not much explicit science talk in the session although there is discussion of which objects do or do not stick. Towards the end of the activity , Chi asks why the ends of the horseshoe magnet are labeled north and south , but the question is overlooked as the activity comes to a close. Magnets are set up on a table; Mot and Chi are seated next to one another behind the table; there are some objects on the black base and some in a pile on the table . Throughout the session there is a young child babbling and talking in the background; additionally , INV and EX2 can sometimes be heard talking to one another in the background; these background utterances are not transcribed
