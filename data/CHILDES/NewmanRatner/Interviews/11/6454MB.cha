*PAR0:	and &-um it was for her sister . 88540_89800
*PAR0:	and now she uses it . 89800_90760
*PAR0:	but so she loves all the food . 90760_92660
*PAR0:	are there ones that she &-um knows the words of or is more familiar with than she is . 93220_100500

*PAR0:	it's one of her favorite food . 109920_110900
*PAR0:	and she picked this up and went up right away . 110980_112480
*PAR0:	&-um I think she knows the word pizza as far as it goes . 113080_117500
*PAR0:	because when say pizza she seems to you know [/] know what I'm talking about . 117560_120800

*PAR0:	&-um you know what I mean because we say it's fruit . 124200_127120
*PAR0:	so like some of them I think she does I mean at Noodles I know she knows that because she'll grab a noodles when I she loves noodles as well . 127820_134940
*PAR0:	so some of it it's so hard at this age because she can't talk back as much . 135880_139980
*PAR0:	I mean she has some words but not a lot . 139980_141720
*PAR0:	right . 141780_142220
*PAR0:	yeah no I mean that's why I always say . 142500_144860

*PAR0:	and &-um a lot of baby board books like the Duckling story or &-um we have hundreds of books at home . 169340_176660
*PAR0:	I'm trying to think of like some of her favorite ones . 177480_179780
*PAR0:	she loves . 180480_181260
*PAR0:	Dr Seuss can't listen long . 181260_182900
*PAR0:	but she likes the rhythm of it in the bright pictures . 182900_185360
*PAR0:	does that make sense . 186120_187620
*PAR0:	&-uh how about did is she playing like interactive games . 188420_191640
*PAR0:	you just &-uh like Patty we do . 191660_193520
*PAR0:	yeah we'll do <Patty cake> [/] Patty cake . 193520_195760
*PAR0:	and she'll clap her hands . 195760_196940
*PAR0:	&-um and even sometimes she'll get this part of it . 196940_199840
*PAR0:	she's not too good with you know the rolling it yet . 199940_202020
*PAR0:	she kind of just goes . 202100_202640
*PAR0:	yeah she'll do that . 203040_204720
*PAR0:	we do Peekaboo a lot . 204800_205900
*PAR0:	she likes to play that . 206020_206860
*PAR0:	she'll put things in like blankets up now and go like this . 206920_209220
*PAR0:	oh Peekaboo yeah Peekaboo &-um and usually verbalize with it too . 209360_214700
*PAR0:	not necessarily the words but something comes out . 214700_217440
*PAR0:	&-um so she plays a lot of those kind of games . 217440_222080
*PAR0:	trying to think of what else we do . 222080_224260
*PAR0:	&-um we do a lot of dancing a lot of singing and a lot of clapping and those kind of games you know like clap after me and sing with me and dancing . 224260_232880
*PAR0:	&-um she has a little radio in the living room that she points to all the time . 233140_236780
*PAR0:	so she's getting really familiar with those songs . 236860_238960
*PAR0:	I'm think Santa's gonna bring us another cd because mommy's sick of it . 239840_243500
*PAR0:	but will it be a present for you . 243840_247140
*PAR0:	yes I think so . 247420_249120
*PAR0:	ha &-um but the spoons and stuff . 249280_252260
*PAR0:	I mean she will . 252260_252880
*PAR0:	now she's starting to . 252880_254300
*PAR0:	like put the pan on the thing because it makes noise like it's frying . 254300_258040
*PAR0:	so she's starting we're seeing more and more every day . 258040_261360
*PAR0:	her doing things that are more like what like imitation of what we do or what you know happens in our kitchen . 261360_267200
*PAR0:	so she might she started toto put a spoon in yesterday and go in like this . 267200_271160
*PAR0:	we were like what you're stirring it . 271800_273180
*PAR0:	like . 273180_273400
*PAR0:	yes . 273400_273880
*PAR0:	&-um and so she's starting to do those kind of things . 274860_277980
*PAR0:	I'm thinking of what else she does . 278000_279360
*PAR0:	makes big messes . 280360_281380
*PAR0:	huh . 281380_281540
*PAR0:	Madison but she loves books . 281540_282860
*PAR0:	I mean she turns the pages now . 282900_284180
*PAR0:	&-um she'll sit and you know look at pictures of them book . 284400_290440
*PAR0:	how about the animals . 291200_292140
*PAR0:	did she how did she play with those today . 292200_294420
*PAR0:	&-um she oh she liked the zebra that came before she . 294940_298820
*PAR0:	and you know I was showing her the two different zebras that are different but they're the same animal . 298820_303880
*PAR0:	&-um but she loves the animals from the books and stuff . 304700_307260
*PAR0:	and we watch some of them on a little picture thing that I have that when we went to the zoo . 307260_313700
*PAR0:	so we'll show her different pictures of the real animals trying to get her to associate them . 313700_317140
*PAR0:	and she loves that too . 317140_319160
*PAR0:	we do that in the car a lot . 319160_320880
*PAR0:	so I think you know she's familiar enough with some of the names of them . 320880_324940
*PAR0:	and I don't know that she would recognize this as a sheep or as a zebra . 324940_329740
*PAR0:	but we were you know &-um she knows Winnie The Pooh from a book . 329740_332940
*PAR0:	we have a Winnie the Pooh book . 332940_333960
*PAR0:	&-um and a lot of them she's seen in the books probably . 333960_339080
*PAR0:	were there any new ones that you tried to introduce her to today . 339940_343980
*PAR0:	&-um the eagle . 343980_347440
*PAR0:	we've never seen an eagle before . 347560_349420
*PAR0:	I don't think I think most of the other ones that we touched she knew . 349680_355540
*PAR0:	but I tried to show her the eagle . 355620_356760
*PAR0:	and [/] and it flies . 356760_358840
*PAR0:	mhm . 359280_359360
*PAR0:	okay . 360400_361080
*PAR0:	and then with the so you were doing more associative with the magnetic things rather than actually like showing her how what they can do . 361400_368760
*PAR0:	yeah . 368760_369380
*PAR0:	oh I took the head off . 369380_370500
*PAR0:	and then she just ate it . 370500_371700
*PAR0:	I mean it's kinda showing her what they do . 372020_374480
*PAR0:	they come apart . 374560_375260
*PAR0:	but also you know this is actually a zebra . 375260_378340
*PAR0:	I don't know . 378940_379740
*PAR0:	okay . 380100_380480
*PAR0:	&-um not sure what I do when I play I just sorta do it . 380480_384240
*PAR0:	no [/] no that's fine . 384600_386240
*PAR0:	&-um was there anything that was different this time than last time that you thought she actually sh she the way she played or the thing she played with or I mean like with the books like she's starting to mimic back to me now . 386340_397340
*PAR0:	so instead of it being all me she's starting ta verbalize more &-um whether it's close or even sometimes if it's not at all . 397440_404540
*PAR0:	so I've I think we play differently now than the last time we were here just in that I'm giving her some opportunities to try to give back to me . 404540_412800
*PAR0:	so like look it says bad . 412800_414580
*PAR0:	what does it say . 414580_415740
*PAR0:	kind of expecting her to give me some response . 415740_418340
*PAR0:	if not the correct then something just more interactive . 418340_422520
*PAR0:	I think you know for up until just recently it was more one-sided play . 422520_426880
*PAR0:	I'd show her . 426880_427360
*PAR0:	she would touch and feel . 427360_428540
*PAR0:	and eat . 428540_429060
*PAR0:	but she wasn't really giving much back to it . 429060_431820
*PAR0:	now she's starting to you know feed the baby the bottle or say the sounds in the book or turn the pages herself because I kind of let her you know if she wants to see one page then fine . 431820_442680
*PAR0:	go back to the duck six times . 442680_443720
*PAR0:	I don't care . 443720_444180
*PAR0:	just you know and Lulu yeah I know was were there any objects or toys in here that were new to her . 444180_453820
*PAR0:	I mean the eagle might have been new . 454700_457240
*PAR0:	I mean some things like . 457720_459740
*PAR0:	I don't think she's ever seen something like this before . 459740_461600
*PAR0:	but she didn't really play with it . 461600_464100
*PAR0:	she kind of stuck more with things that she's seen I think before . 464100_466940
*PAR0:	and oh you're gonna play with it now because it looks tasty . 466940_469760
*PAR0:	I know . 469760_470380
*PAR0:	but most of the other things here are things that we have at home . 471680_476020
*PAR0:	the three kids we've accumulated a lot . 476900_478900
*PAR0:	mhm . 479120_479380
*PAR0:	it's the books and the stuffed <animals and the> [/] animals and the kitchen stuff which we have . 479900_484580
*PAR0:	and so you said out of the food I guess that she played with or was interested in &-um bread peas and pizza . 486020_496700
*PAR0:	she definitely would be familiar with . 496700_498780
*PAR0:	okay things that she has on a consistent basis . 498780_501440
*PAR0:	spaghetti [/] spaghetti huh you love noodles all those noodles [/] noodles . 501440_509200
*PAR0:	&-um I mean she would be familiar with like the ice cream . 509200_519660
*PAR0:	although we don't usually have it in a cone because her sister's gluten free . 519660_523420
*PAR0:	okay . 523420_524340
*PAR0:	so that might be novel . 524340_525640
*PAR0:	&-um I mean the peanut butter she probably doesn't I mean it's in our house . 525640_533200
*PAR0:	and her sister likes it . 533200_534240
*PAR0:	so I don't know if she's picked up on it but . 534240_536020
*PAR0:	she's never had it or we've never given it to her or showed her the container because it's peanuts . 536020_539840
*PAR0:	she's not one yet so she may not know that one nom [/] nom [/] nom [/] nom [/] nom . 539840_546500
*PAR0:	I eat . 546500_547220
*PAR0:	thank you . 547220_547800
*PAR0:	thank you . 547800_549760
*PAR0:	oh this one's are they &-um the clock is something new . 549760_572760
*PAR0:	but I'm not totally surprised only because her older sister's learning time right now . 572760_577060
*PAR0:	mhm . 577060_577200
*PAR0:	so we do have a clock in the living room . 577200_578720
*PAR0:	and we have been her older sister plays with it a lot . 578720_581420
*PAR0:	mm . 581420_581520
*PAR0:	and she really hasn't used it at home . 581520_583280
*PAR0:	but she probably has wanted to &-um so I'm not surprised necessarily that she grabbed it . 583280_588880
*PAR0:	but it is different than like a typical toy she'd play with . 588880_591980
*PAR0:	other than that . 593200_595540
*PAR0:	I mean most of them are familiar . 595540_596820
*PAR0:	and you know I figured she'd go for at least one or two books and the baby right away . 596820_603060
*PAR0:	okay . 603520_603980
*PAR0:	yeah . 605080_605480
*PAR0:	the baby is she you saying any words or you doing a lot of mimicking . 605480_613920
*PAR0:	she does a lot of mimicing . 613920_615140
*PAR0:	she says . 615140_615480
*PAR0:	mama and dada . 615480_616480
*PAR0:	she says . 616480_617160
*PAR0:	ball &-um bye [/] bye . 617160_619960
*PAR0:	she'll go bye [/] bye [/] bye . 620200_621100
*PAR0:	&-um and for her bottle she also says . 621780_624060
*PAR0:	bye [/] bye . 624060_624440
*PAR0:	but it's usually more in an angry tone of voice . 624440_627580
*PAR0:	because it usually she only wants it when she's tired . 627900_630440
*PAR0:	&-um she does some signing . 630440_633920
*PAR0:	so she does more . 633920_634720
*PAR0:	and she'll say . 634720_635700
*PAR0:	ma [/] ma . 635700_636380
*PAR0:	but she signs it usually like this . 636380_638140
*PAR0:	huh more . 638140_638960
*PAR0:	&-um her sisters taught her some sign language because they are into it . 638960_643900
*PAR0:	&-um she says some other things . 643900_646420
*PAR0:	I'm trying to remember . 646420_649160
*PAR0:	they taught her ghee this weekend for my mom . 649160_654660
*PAR0:	although I don't know that she's using it consistently for her but I'm . 654660_660120
*PAR0:	trying to think of what else . 660120_662300
*PAR0:	if give me back the list . 662300_663640
*PAR0:	I can go through it and tell you . 663640_666260
*PAR0:	it's hard . 666260_667420
*PAR0:	I actually just wondering you know if it was just a question is that an important question . 667420_671580
*PAR0:	okay . 671580_672000
*PAR0:	it's just it's hard to remember everything that I'm like babbling on . 672000_676540
*PAR0:	and I feel really silly . 676540_677760
*PAR0:	&-um you know but she will verbalize for a lot of things you know . 677760_682480
*PAR0:	I mean she's getting to that point now where she's mimicking back constantly . 682480_686500
*PAR0:	and she has some things that she uses consistently like &-um like buh [/] buh mama daddy dad [/] dad more did you play with her sister a lot . 686520_698840
*PAR0:	they play with her a lot . 699320_700980
*PAR0:	&-um <a lot> [/] a lot . 700980_703100
*PAR0:	&-um they taught her to walk . 703220_704220
*PAR0:	I mean I was playing with her with it . 704640_706140
*PAR0:	but they were convinced she should walk . 706140_707980
*PAR0:	so she gets a lot of attention in our house . 708140_712460
*PAR0:	just because there's two little mommies that are older . 712460_714140
*PAR0:	I mean they're five and ten . 714240_715020
*PAR0:	so yeah they're you know they're sort she's sort of their baby doll . 715020_719740
*PAR0:	now they're [/] they're too big to play with their baby dolls . 719740_722480
*PAR0:	aw . 722680_723140
*PAR0:	okay it's really sweet . 723220_724460
*PAR0:	it's really cute . 724780_725960
*PAR0:	so she's learning I mean she has the opportunity to learn &-uh different things that probably at this age . 726260_732340
*PAR0:	she wouldn't be introduced to like colors and yeah [/] yeah and clocks I mean just the you know because it's in the house because the kids are doing it . 732340_740700
*PAR0:	and &-uh there's always other kids around because my older daughter's friends are always at our house . 740800_745020
*PAR0:	so then there's even more things that come in like boy stuff and spider-man . 745320_748980
*PAR0:	and so she's you know one nice thing for her is that she's being exposed to so much more than my older daughter was because there's so many people around all the time . 749140_756480
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 757440_759980
*PAR0:	&-um what kind you said . 761020_762300
*PAR0:	she had a lot of books . 762300_763420
*PAR0:	books do you do . 763420_763980
*PAR0:	and we've talked a lot about animals . 763980_765880
*PAR0:	but do I just kind of vaguely brought up like the idea of colors and things have [/] have she's been have you been playing a lot with those . 765880_773520
*PAR0:	yeah you know when my older daughter's learning about Ordinal Value and I made gingerbread men across our living room in all different colors . 773520_779340
*PAR0:	so we could practice you know the fifth one is blue or whatever . 779340_782460
*PAR0:	but she actually likes them more than anybody in the house I think because they're like gingerbread men I guess big smiles on them . 782460_787560
*PAR0:	and so we do this thing . 787560_789120
*PAR0:	blue little gingerbread man red little gingerbread man . 789120_792140
*PAR0:	and she loves it . 792140_792820
*PAR0:	and she always is pointing to that . 792820_794100
*PAR0:	and the books have the Kellers too . 794100_795340
*PAR0:	sometimes we play with that . 795340_796600
*PAR0:	&-um I don't have any thought that she knows them yet by any means . 796600_801240
*PAR0:	I don't even think it's developmentally appropriate . 801240_802840
*PAR0:	but we do [/] do it you know just to expose her . 802840_807380
*PAR0:	yeah you know I don't feel like she'd learn them at this point or anytime in the near future . 807380_813060
*PAR0:	but huh maybe you'll surprise me . 813060_815920
*PAR0:	is she drawn to one particular color over another . 815920_820460
*PAR0:	gosh . 820460_823140
*PAR0:	I don't know I've never really noticed . 823140_826160
*PAR0:	so I guess not because I've never really noticed she likes bright colors better than dull ones like I know like the neon pink and neon green that my older daughter's into . 826160_834920
*PAR0:	I she loves those bright Neon eighties . 834920_837560
*PAR0:	colors that I haven't seen since I was much younger . 837560_841440
*PAR0:	&-um so she will go toward them . 841440_843340
*PAR0:	&-uh she likes those colors . 843800_845080
*PAR0:	but as far as like the regular primaries I haven't noticed any . 845240_848280
*PAR0:	no . 848420_848740

*PAR0:	and I know it's from a speech and language pathologist point of view . 873180_875240

*PAR0:	but we use Toofies &-um look at my toofies . 877660_880440
*PAR0:	then she shows me hers because I'm trying to see them coming in . 880920_883760
