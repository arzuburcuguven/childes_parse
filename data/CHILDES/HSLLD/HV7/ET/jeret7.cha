@Comment:	Time is 32:48. Explains the magnet activity and that he will be videotaping their hands
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play well together and talk between the two is more or less balanced. EXP stays in the background , only laughing at certain points during the activity. After looking at the various objects , MOT and Chi proceed to build something on the black base. Next , MOT and Chi become interested in the yellow wand. They notice that coins are not attracted to the magnets , and they find this fact interesting , but no further discussion of the properties of magnets follows. Magnets are set up on a table; Chi and Mot are seated on either side of it; there are several objects stuck to both the yellow wand and the black base
