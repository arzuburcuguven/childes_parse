*PAR0:	but she has one at home now . 387700_388600
*PAR0:	so she wasn't as focused on that . 388660_390920
*PAR0:	so she'd play with other things . 391100_394040
*PAR0:	was there anything that last time . 394660_398380
*PAR0:	&-um she . 398380_400340
*PAR0:	didn't play with . 400340_401080
*PAR0:	but this time is like holding she on she played a lot with the food . 401080_404360

*PAR0:	the first time all she wanted to play with was food . 443140_444960
*PAR0:	guess she I don't think she's really played with stuffed animals before she's kinda noticed them . 445140_449700
*PAR0:	but she played with them more this time . 449800_451180
*PAR0:	the first time all she wanted to do was find a two shapes that matched because she was absolutely fascinated by having two things and the same thing in her hand . 451520_461700
*PAR0:	so she spent the entire time I think with the noodles . 461700_464460
*PAR0:	I'm sure she didn't recognize them as noodles then . 464460_467120
*PAR0:	so all she wanted to do was hold them because she dug through the objects and found two things that matched . 467120_474620
*PAR0:	and there was no &-um stuffed animal that she kept like gravitating to because I thought there was like . 474620_480380
