@Comment:	MOT gives Chi many ideas for the letter , including some of the exact wording , but also encourages Chi to come up with his own ideas. Chi does incorporate several of his own ideas , and includes most of Mot's suggestions as well. When Mot and Chi disagree , as with the dilemma of writing come or came , Chi accepts Mot's opinion. Chi generally writes on his own , and then submits it to Mot for approval. Chi occasionally asks for the correct spellings of words. Mot corrects some but not all of Chi's mistakes of spelling and punctuation. When Chi is having difficulty , such as with the capital <J> in January , MOT is supportive and helps him through it. Chi and Mot work very well together , and the interaction between them is emotionally positive throughout.
