*PAR0:	I mean it's but I don't know it might just be because there's always kids around like my oldest is turning twelve . 177040_182300
*PAR0:	and that's a novelty . 182300_183300
*PAR0:	so they're constantly talking to her and playing with her . 183300_186420

*PAR0:	other play sessions . 238040_238880
*PAR0:	did she tend to go for something consistently like did she like go for the food a lot or I n I don't remember her doing that . 238880_246300
*PAR0:	I think it was just whatever . 246340_247360
*PAR0:	and then once she's involved she usually stays involved for an extended period of time . 247700_252820
*PAR0:	so even at home if we have the little people stuff out she wants to play with that . 252820_256880
*PAR0:	and then you know a fifteen twenty thirty minutes might go by before she goes on to the next area of the house and has another thing out . 256880_264680
*PAR0:	&-um so she sits and likes to do like one thing . 264680_268100
*PAR0:	especially if she's got a friend to play with mean if someone's gonna play with her she's you know yeah . 268100_273260

*PAR0:	well we actually don't read the book very often . 279200_280940
*PAR0:	but we say the book every night . 280940_282440
*PAR0:	oh so I've had it memorized since my oldest was a toddler because we used to read it every night . 282700_288060
*PAR0:	and then eventually we just the book it would be dark . 288060_292480
*PAR0:	so we would just say the book . 292480_293560
*PAR0:	so now she you know she's seen the book numerous times . 293560_296100
*PAR0:	but yeah she knows the whole story for the most part . 296100_298340
*PAR0:	yeah I know that was good . 298340_299460
*PAR0:	she's like filling it in and stuff . 299460_300980

*PAR0:	she's got a lot of her own books . 312620_313820
*PAR0:	and she's got like all the Elmo Books from Reader's Digest from ten years . 313820_317520
*PAR0:	ago that she reads all the way up to &-um new picture books . 317520_320820
*PAR0:	we go to the library a lot too . 320820_321920
*PAR0:	so she enjoys that a cup in the car and a pillowthe cup in the car the cups in the car . 321920_329380
*PAR0:	yeah . 329380_330760
*PAR0:	and she even liked to tell the story back . 330760_332460
*PAR0:	like sometimes you know kids don't really even try . 332460_335260
*PAR0:	but she we do that a lot at home too . 335260_337280
*PAR0:	so yeah she tells she likes to be you know my turn . 337280_341960
*PAR0:	she's very she can be bossy . 341960_344380
*PAR0:	she really can is there anything else that was different at all from other sessions . 344380_351120
*PAR0:	or I mean she's taking more of a lead now than me . 351120_354820
*PAR0:	so as she's gotten older in play she kind of does a lot more of the like I might have before been more likely to say . 354820_363340
*PAR0:	you know . 363340_363620
*PAR0:	oh what about this . 363620_364620
*PAR0:	let's talk about this or play with this just because she wasn't as verbal or as able to like you know she would get bored . 364620_371400
*PAR0:	now she kind of just she runs it for the most part . 371400_374920
*PAR0:	the plays more her centered . 374920_376080
*PAR0:	and I'm playing with her instead of she's playing with me I guess . 376080_379740
*PAR0:	yeah it's how I'd stay it . 379740_381020
*PAR0:	so think that was different . 381020_383620
*PAR0:	and just her being able to pay attention a lot longer to one thing . 383620_388360
*PAR0:	she doesn't need novelty all the time . 388560_390040
*PAR0:	she likes to kinda do her thing . 390060_392000
*PAR0:	yeah no that's good cause you were saying she didn't have a very long attention span . 392360_395200
*PAR0:	but like she seems like she does well you know like for [/] for a two year old right for a two year old . 395200_400380

*PAR0:	yeah . 408140_408400
*PAR0:	&-um I'm gonna grab I think we have the little toys in there so she can chew something . 408400_413220
*PAR0:	and then I just have two more consents for you . 413420_416420
*PAR0:	sure if you wanna look at them the first one is &-um it's a final consent form . 416780_422480
*PAR0:	it's basically we've been recording the both of you . 422480_424860
*PAR0:	but we were hoping to go back and look at your speech as well like looking at things like &-um your rate &-um variety of words you use . 424860_431960
*PAR0:	&-um things like that . 431960_433100
*PAR0:	sort of like as she g got older see kinda like how it differed from visit to visit . 433100_438400
*PAR0:	it's fine . 438800_439380
*PAR0:	and then the last consent is basically it's separate from our study . 439620_443200
