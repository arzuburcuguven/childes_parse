*FAT:	this is the fourth recording from Ross and it's being made &-uh on September twenty first and &-uh started on September twenty first . 2045_13285
*FAT:	and we've I realized that we've &-uh got a huge gap here . 13345_16605
*FAT:	but frankly he really hasn't been changing almost at all in his actual articulations over this period . 16625_24405
*FAT:	so it just didn't seem like &-uh there was much reason to do recording . 24505_27405
