@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	basically what we have here are some objects that we brought you_all to play with back when you were in preschool I think .
@Comment:	Time is 17:16. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
@Comment:	MOT and Chi do not interact much during the play session. Mot mostly watches while Chi moves magnets around. When Mot does attempt to move magnets Chi grabs them back from her. Occasionally , MOT uses a false voice for sound effects or to act as if she is speaking as one of the objects. Chi finds this amusing and usually laughs. Scientific talk is fairly non- existent , although Chi says north and south at one point in reference to a magnet. Play ends abruptly when Chi announces he is finished.
