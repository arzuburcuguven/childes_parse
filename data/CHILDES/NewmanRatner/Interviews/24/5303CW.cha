*PAR0:	oh so she'll actually talk and tell you . 245120_246880
*PAR0:	oh that's really good . 246880_247840
*PAR0:	yes . 247840_248180
*PAR0:	I feel like some of the kids . 248180_249640
*PAR0:	she hasn't played with that yet . 267240_268300
*PAR0:	and she knows ours you know the [/] the one in the kitchen is hot . 268300_271220
*PAR0:	I do right . 271400_272080
*PAR0:	but &-uh no we do have we don't have the little play scene types of things over there . 272400_276780
*PAR0:	but the animals we've got . 276780_278020
*PAR0:	and &-um do you think was did she tend to go for a lot of the same things as she's gone for in the past [/] past or [/] or I [/] I think [/] think so [/] so I [/] I think [/] think she [/] she did [/] did go [/] go for [/] for the [/] the food before and the animals before . 279760_291560
*PAR0:	but she doesn't usually play with &-um like the [/] the doll and that type of . 292140_295920
*PAR0:	not here . 295920_296480
*PAR0:	no . 296480_296800
*PAR0:	mm . 297060_297240
*PAR0:	mm . 297240_297360
*PAR0:	and like I said that's only been a new development at home or there's one of the daycare that she goes to that . 297500_302040
*PAR0:	she really likes she did has a pacifier . 302040_303680
*PAR0:	so she'll you know Pink Nana she calls her Nana Pink Nana yeah . 304260_310400
*PAR0:	&-um every time &-um more the [/] the this play was more interactive like you know she was eating or she would try to get the other animals to eat or the baby to eat . 310400_330100
*PAR0:	&-um that I don't remember her doing . 330100_332660
*PAR0:	before like before I was like she would pretend to eat it . 332660_335060
*PAR0:	but now this time she was having the animals eat it or [/] or go find it and things . 335060_339740
*PAR0:	so it was different seemed to she seemed to really like feeding the different animals stuff like that . 339740_346580
*PAR0:	yeah I think &-um I feel like . 346580_349340
*PAR0:	yeah a lot of kids start doing that you know at the beginning . 349340_352040
*PAR0:	it's just biting everything and moving the mouth . 352040_355860
*PAR0:	and now they're sort of doing more with it . 355860_357720
*PAR0:	so that's good . 357720_359120
*PAR0:	&-um yeah I think that's &-um I think the last thing I need to just give you is the consent . 359120_365140
*PAR0:	okay . 365420_365720
*PAR0:	we have &-um we have another consent . 365940_369780
*PAR0:	okay no problem . 369900_370760
*PAR0:	&-um but what we've been doing this whole time . 370840_372960
*PAR0:	&-um we've been actually looking at &-um her speech and then also &-um your speech along with it . 372960_378840
*PAR0:	oh okay . 378900_379200
*PAR0:	see at different levels of &-um her development and looking at whether [/] whether the mother's speech changes at different times . 379220_386820
*PAR0:	sort of like if you say things a little differently it kind of helps them learn how it changes at different ages . 386820_391480
*PAR0:	sure . 391480_391820
*PAR0:	okay . 391820_392140
*PAR0:	so the first consent is &-um I'll give you a too depend . 392140_395580
*PAR0:	the first consent is &-um to have us <I think> [/] I think you sign on the back . 395580_400720
*PAR0:	okay . 400720_401600
*PAR0:	&-um so the first concern is to &-um allow us to look at your speech and analyze it for our research . 401600_407880
*PAR0:	&-um and then the second form &-um they have a database online where other researchers have been using &-um transcripts of &-um speech and trying to analyze it . 408420_418780
*PAR0:	oh okay . 418940_419400
*PAR0:	have &-um the acoustic it's more just like written transcripts . 419460_422940
*PAR0:	so they don't . 422980_423160
*PAR0:	have all the information if &-um it's instance not audio . 423160_426620
*PAR0:	oh okay . 427060_427380
*PAR0:	you're trying to compile a database with audio files . 427380_429500
*PAR0:	sure . 429540_429740
*PAR0:	and so there's different . 430040_431040
*PAR0:	there's &-um three different ones if you would wanna be allowed to ha allow us to use that on the database . 431460_437120
*PAR0:	it would be completely de identified . 437240_438400
*PAR0:	&-um it would be completely anytime if you say your name her name dog's name anything it's de-identified so one would be to use just the transcripts . 439320_448800
*PAR0:	&-um and then the other one would be if you wanted to let us use the audio so we could actually analyze different parts because sometimes you know if you only transcribe certain aspects of a speech you know want something else . 449600_459760
*PAR0:	mm . 459960_460120
*PAR0:	hm you can't because it's not there . 460120_461840
*PAR0:	so you kinda get you know more updated . 462000_463640
*PAR0:	so whatever you wanna choose is fine . 463780_465500
*PAR0:	&-um and yeah well thank you so much for taking . 466280_469680
*PAR0:	oh not a problem . 469680_471160
