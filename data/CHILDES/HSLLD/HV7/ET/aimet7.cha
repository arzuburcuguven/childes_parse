@Comment:	MOT and Chi only seem moderately comfortable with this activity. Mot , especially , is unsure of the purpose of the activity. Most of the time is spent arranging the silver men or playing with the yellow wand. Chi pretends that one of the silver men plays basketball. Discussion about the magnets centers primarily on their strength. EXP remains in the background. Mot does most of the talking.
