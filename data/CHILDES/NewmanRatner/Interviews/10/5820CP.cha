*PAR0:	okay . 0_1560
*PAR0:	so &-uh what do you think he played with . 1560_4840
*PAR0:	he liked the most here today . 4840_6420
*PAR0:	&-um spoons only because he's really into trying to feed himself these days . 6420_12840
*PAR0:	yeah . 12840_13260
*PAR0:	&-uh and the food of course he spent the most time with the peas and the pizza . 13260_17920
*PAR0:	it seems do you think &-um he recognized the names of the things . 17920_26500
*PAR0:	his peas don't look like this . 26500_29160
*PAR0:	so I don't know . 29160_32900
*PAR0:	I don't know why maybe the color I think the colors of the pizza were probably the most attractive to him because he does tend to navigate to reds and yellows and that kind of thing . 32900_44620
*PAR0:	&-um that's also what I think attracted him about the clock . 44620_48180
*PAR0:	&-uh that seemed to be good . 49000_49980
*PAR0:	this is a toy . 50120_51160
*PAR0:	looks like a toy he has at home . 51160_52460
*PAR0:	so that one I thought he [/] he was sort of interested in the books . 53240_57520
*PAR0:	didn't really seem to he kind of related to this one because we have a Facebook at home you know with just different baby faces in it . 57520_64900
*PAR0:	so &-uh it held his interest just for a little while but not [/] not play that activity . 64900_69880
*PAR0:	no . 70300_70700
*PAR0:	well do we do peekaboo . 70700_71900
*PAR0:	yes we do peekaboot . 71900_73060
*PAR0:	&-um but usually I do peekaboo like from behind something &-uh &-uh like a wall or a you know something like that . 73500_82620
*PAR0:	but &-uh spoons definitely because he's into feeding himself the poo and the clock . 82620_89060
*PAR0:	I think he was interested in this because I've got a puppet at home that I play with him . 89060_93640
*PAR0:	oh okay . 93700_94160
*PAR0:	what's the name of the puppet . 94400_95580
*PAR0:	it's not it doesn't have a name . 95660_96940
*PAR0:	it's an elephant actually though . 97040_99080
*PAR0:	but I did the same thing . 99080_99920
*PAR0:	and I did . 99920_100160
*PAR0:	the same little stupid voice . 100160_101840
*PAR0:	so &-um I don't know about this one . 101840_107220
*PAR0:	he [/] <he was> [/] he was intrigued by it . 107220_109380
*PAR0:	but then he kind of lost interest . 109380_110680
*PAR0:	you know it's like . 110680_111200
*PAR0:	oh hair stretches . 111200_112220
*PAR0:	oh nice . 112220_113000
*PAR0:	okay . 113000_113400
*PAR0:	and that was sort of the end of that . 113760_115840
*PAR0:	&-um that's kind of it . 116760_119440
*PAR0:	the peas and the food in the spoons were probably the most [/] most interesting . 119440_124940
*PAR0:	and this is the only one that I noticed that he went . 124940_126680
*PAR0:	and he got on his own . 126680_128540
*PAR0:	he like crawled . 128540_129120
*PAR0:	and he went and got on his own that . 129120_130400
*PAR0:	and when he saw those teaspoons he got those on [/] on the his table own too [/] too . 130400_134760
*PAR0:	it's that's interesting . 134760_135900
*PAR0:	interesting .
*PAR0:	&-um &-um do [/] do you [/] you have [/] have how [/] how about [/] about any [/] any of the names that you may have used to play with some of the toys today . 135900_142000
*PAR0:	&-um did you think you any of them were familiar . 142700_145400
*PAR0:	he's heard of them in house . 145540_146660
*PAR0:	I usually call this his friend or [/] or any of his stuffed toys . 146680_149640
*PAR0:	I like is that your friend you know <is that> [/] is that who <you want you want> [/] you want to play with . 149760_154020
*PAR0:	today . 154020_154440
*PAR0:	that's what I usually do . 154560_156240
*PAR0:	so he's &-um this is probably the only one that looks familiar . 156340_161160
*PAR0:	and [/] and maybe this one is sort of you know that looks something like what we [/] we [/] we have at home . 161460_165520
*PAR0:	we don't it's interesting that he's interested in the food because we don't have food toys at home . 165940_170480
*PAR0:	so I don't know . 170820_172440
*PAR0:	bless you . 172780_173900
*PAR0:	yes you but he [/] he [/] he does he is attracted to colors like . 173940_179320
*PAR0:	and we have an activity block that . 179320_180560
*PAR0:	has colors that are similar to this . 180560_182200
*PAR0:	and [/] and I think the bright colors were probably what interested him . 182200_185680
*PAR0:	yeah &-uh sound yeah sound . 185680_193680
*PAR0:	and if it does stuff woo &-uh but usually he likes even if it does stuff the like we have a pop up ball thing . 193680_202480
*PAR0:	and even if it does stuff he wants to you know go and get the balls or stop the balls from popping up or you know just he [/] he wants to be the [/] the one that sort of controls the activity for it . 202880_215660
*PAR0:	so that's kind of interesting . 215660_217380
*PAR0:	so these are good . 217380_218040
*PAR0:	it's good . 218040_218360
*PAR0:	these are sort of you know non you know they require him to function for like to work . 218360_226400
*PAR0:	so what about at home . 226400_230360
*PAR0:	does he like to play with more toys and books or books . 230360_237120
*PAR0:	I think he associates with going down for the evening kind of nap time . 237120_241400
*PAR0:	that's you know this is the end of my day . 241400_243780
*PAR0:	so he's probably I'd have to say probably more toys than books . 243780_248240
*PAR0:	he also during the day he plays a lot with my niece . 248240_251080
*PAR0:	they [/] they you know they do a lot of things together . 251960_254020
*PAR0:	you know toys . 254200_254860
*PAR0:	she she's probably more into books than he is . 255340_257800
*PAR0:	so if she's reading it to him she's too . 257860_261600
*PAR0:	so <she's you know> [/] she's you know blah [/] blah [/] blah picture . 261720_264200
*PAR0:	look Colin and he's I [/] I but I think he's more interested in you know playing with her than necessarily he is in the book . 264320_271700
*PAR0:	so but he [/] he [/] he [/] he [/] he she'll sit he'll sit and listen to her . 271800_277020
*PAR0:	read to him . 277020_277660

*PAR0:	so what about &-um changes from last time . 300800_303600
*PAR0:	do you remember what he played last time . 303640_305300
*PAR0:	&-um it seemed to me he was more into this one last time . 305300_309640
*PAR0:	he still remembered this one from you know being &-uh from being at home . 309640_313820
*PAR0:	can you call it poo . 313820_315340
*PAR0:	I'm so oh I'm sorry your friend . 315340_316740
*PAR0:	oh right . 316740_317260
*PAR0:	I call it <your friend> [/] your friend I call him poo . 317260_319460
*PAR0:	but you know you want to play with your friend Poo but you want to this is your friend . 319460_323160
*PAR0:	&-um that he was interested interesting enough . 323160_328460
*PAR0:	he was interested in the food last time also . 328460_330320
*PAR0:	&-um he didn't really connect with the good night moon because we &-uh but we have that at home . 330800_335840
*PAR0:	which I thought was sort of interesting . 335840_337560
*PAR0:	but yeah he was food the last time too might be the texture of the p the way it feels to him [/] him . 337680_344200
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah it was the food last time too . 344200_348700
*PAR0:	&-uh food probably the poo . 350300_351780
*PAR0:	and this little thing maybe this one too because I think it had twinklies and spark you know do you think &-um so do [/] do you think there was much of a difference or was pretty or the same from the time . 351780_363800
*PAR0:	he was little bit more you know before I was bringing the toys to him more now he kind . 363800_369320
*PAR0:	of this was you know towards the end . 369320_370900
*PAR0:	he sort of went out and [/] and pursued his own toy . 370900_374820
*PAR0:	so <that's probably> [/] that's probably my husband eats pizza . 374820_400440
*PAR0:	maybe . 400440_401640
*PAR0:	I [/] I don't know . 401640_402820
*PAR0:	I mean it kind of looks like that . 402820_404340
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know why he was so interested <in the in the> [/] in the foods . 404340_411280
*PAR0:	I I'm it might [/] might the only thing I could think is maybe it's the [/] the [/] the feel of it . 411720_416080
*PAR0:	it's the feel of it because nothing . 416620_418360
*PAR0:	there's nothing here that looks like anything that we you know because he get by the time he gets it it's in little chunks . 418360_424180
*PAR0:	so I it doesn't really look like anything that he would recognize as being what it is . 424180_430080
*PAR0:	so &-uh the only thing I figure is maybe it's the texture or the color something about the color that attracts him to it . 430080_436860
*PAR0:	okay . 437460_437600
*PAR0:	okay . 438600_439860
*PAR0:	well thank you very much . 440180_441540
*PAR0:	I think that's it . 441560_442360
