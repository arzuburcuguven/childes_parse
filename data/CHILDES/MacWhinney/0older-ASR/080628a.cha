*PAR5:	yeah Papa and you move it once . 1513915_1517045

*PAR5:	<bounces and> [/] bounces and then bounces all the way up to the light . 1521315_1526965
*PAR5:	<and then> [/] and then you can go . 1527025_1530165
*PAR5:	and it bounces back into the little toy . 1531345_1534005
*PAR4:	<there's a> [/] there's a something that police and the ambulance used in some cities . 1534435_1542975
*PAR4:	what that isn't the toy . 1544045_1545775
*PAR7:	what . 1546565_1546855
*PAR4:	that it is in the car . 1547125_1549495
*PAR4:	it &-uh . 1550395_1550935
*PAR5:	checks that it's . 1551595_1553735
*PAR4:	like a light that or . 1553735_1556095
*PAR5:	that checks . 1556725_1557375
*PAR5:	so he isn't doing something . 1557955_1561135
*PAR4:	wrong . 1561135_1561415
*PAR4:	no . 1561715_1561935
*PAR4:	it shines to the traffic light . 1561955_1565855
*PAR4:	it sends some kinda a radio message . 1566915_1568695
*PAR4:	either that or it shines a light at the message at the &-um traffic light . 1568695_1575685
*PAR4:	and changes it's green for him . 1575745_1577725
*PAR4:	just like what you're saying . 1579355_1580565
*PAR4:	only it isn't a toy . 1583915_1585085
*PAR4:	it's so that the ambulance will have a red a green light . 1587075_1593285
*PAR4:	and you know why that's good for an ambulance . 1596145_1598085
*PAR5:	because we have to rush all the time . 1598925_1600565
*PAR4:	they have to rush all the time . 1600875_1602085
*PAR4:	and if people in the opposite direction going across have a green light . 1602705_1608365
*PAR4:	then the people won't be so careful when they see the ambulance . 1609435_1613245
*PAR4:	because they'll already be going on a green light . 1613245_1616765
*PAR4:	whereas if they've already stopped for a red light it's easy for the easier for the ambulance to go . 1617235_1626285
*PAR7:	okay . 1627395_1627685
*PAR4:	because an ambulance can go on a red light . 1628235_1630725
*PAR4:	anyway . 1630745_1631165
*PAR5:	I know . 1633085_1633485
*PAR4:	but some people don't see them that's the problem . 1633905_1636965
*PAR4:	and so your little toy already there's already something like your little toy . 1640625_1645645
*PAR5:	what . 1646675_1646965
*PAR4:	only it isn't a toy . 1647635_1648685
*PAR4:	it's a real thing . 1648685_1649485
*PAR5:	I . 1650805_1650925
*PAR4:	mean it's for Grownups . 1650925_1651965
*PAR5:	you mean my little toy could turn out to be something like that [/] that fence . 1652465_1660205
