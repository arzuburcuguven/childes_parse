*PAR0:	so mainly like [/] like . 77900_79820
*PAR0:	yeah books balls blocks type stuff . 79820_84240
*PAR0:	you think he recognized anything from last time any of toys . 84460_87600
*PAR0:	he seemed to really maybe the food toys because that's all he wanted to play with last time too . 87640_92620
*PAR0:	oh okay . 92860_93360

*PAR0:	if you say you know this is &-uh something he might recognize . 103880_107700
*PAR0:	I think the only one he would recognize would be <the books> [/] the books . 107700_110000
*PAR0:	yeah . 110000_110300
*PAR0:	and I we do have like some dog . 110300_112160
*PAR0:	but this doesn't look like any of the dogs that he would be used to . 112160_115340
*PAR0:	so I don't think he would recognize some of the other ant . 115340_118060
*PAR0:	these are all kind of unusual animals . 118080_119640
*PAR0:	so like we . 120100_120680
*PAR0:	would have like a cow or &-um a pig but not like a zebra . 120680_125120
*PAR0:	so right . 125440_126060
*PAR0:	so and then you pick this one up . 126200_128480
*PAR0:	has he seen this before . 128580_129640

*PAR0:	no if he [/] he may have played with it briefly last time . 130820_134260
*PAR0:	but we don't have anything like that at home . 134260_135700
*PAR0:	okay . 135800_136460
*PAR0:	okay . 137180_137500
*PAR0:	how about there's another one . 138200_140200
*PAR0:	but the foods what is he had before that he recognizes or that he would chew on &-um the pizza . 140580_148900
*PAR0:	he loves the pizza like anything . 149080_150700
*PAR0:	that's kind of squishy . 150700_151500
*PAR0:	he really likes those . 151980_153000
*PAR0:	so the waffles and the [/] the like pizza &-um and the peas those would probably be his favorites . 153020_161340
*PAR0:	so last time though he did not really play with this or the sippy cup . 161340_166080
*PAR0:	and this time he actually was trying to put it in his mouth and drink from it . 166080_169900
*PAR0:	so that was different . 169900_171300
*PAR0:	&-um he played with the boxes more last time . 171300_174560
*PAR0:	mm . 175340_175540

*PAR0:	other utensils &-um a spoon . 232840_235480
*PAR0:	we'll let him play with it . 235480_236940
*PAR0:	he hasn't played with a fork or a knife yet . 236940_239620
