is that the one thats meeting with the other person
you dont know okay i guess you dont
so how old were oh i guess i just asked you that
how old were you when you first started to play
okay and who taught you how to play chess
-uh huh
i understand that
so do you have a chess rating
well im i am not totally familiar with chess ratings
i think that theyre that you could be intermediate you could be advanced you could be beginner
okay probably better than me
i play a little chess
so do you have a chess coach or teacher
miss mix
miss mix you said
do you know how she spells her name
well ill just spell it how it sounds
m i k s c h whew
thats interesting okay
and do you belong to a chess club
the one here
and this is lincoln middle school right
and so if i said how often do you play chess say in a typical week
cuz it takes awhile
and so who do you play with the most
okay thats all the stuff that i had to write down
now im just going to ask you stuff
ill let that do the work for me
so can you name any famous chess players
have you heard of any
well i thought that maybe miss miksch or however she says her name
maybe would mention something
so do you ever play chess on a computer
can you tell me about it
ah ha
i think ive seen someone play it but im not real sure
-uh huh
you dont feel intimidated by the
so a real person
hm so now can you tell me why you enjoy chess
-uh huh
-uh huh
good thinking
and thats part of why you enjoy it you think or
speaking of complex strategies -um were going to talk about the rules of chess now
so im not too familiar with the game of chess
i told you that i play a little bit but not that familiar with it and you probably know a lot more about it than i do
so id like you to explain some things to me
first of all how many people can play a game of chess at one time
ive never heard of that
-uh huh
so ive heard of simultaneous matches
do you know what that is
-uh huh
-uh huh
so can you tell me about different pieces and how theyre supposed to move
and how do they move
and then what happens if its diagonal
okay so pawn
what else is in there
and what do those guys do
what happens if they hit someone
okay right
-uh huh
right an l shape
is that so they can go
can they go two forward and one over or do they
and why do you call them castles
okay so lets see
now tell me about the goals of chess
in other words what are the players trying to do
so how about with a basic game
the goal is get that king and trap him
checkmate -uh huh
oh yeah
so now tell me the rules that players need to follow
in other words tell me everything you can think of about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play
ive heard of that
so what is that
so he told you what it was
when he was doing it
okay so lets see now id like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess
in other words what are some key strategies that every good player should know
three moves
so you can do a checkmate in three moves
so you couldnt explain how somebody else who can do it does it
so what do you mean by as theyre setting up
this is not a typo he did say “in checkmate” two times
it sounds tough
so youll get it back probably huh
so how long does it usually take to play a game of chess
how long do you usually play
so how does that work
it sounds like fun
so what makes a game last a long time
especially without a board in front of you
so what makes a game end quickly be short
do you think thats true
so do you know how to use a chess clock
so you have to make your move within that time
and what happens if you dont
on the computer
it seems pretty fast
so is there anything else that you want to tell me about chess
ah lets see
theres no other questions right there but i was just trying to think if i had any more questions
i guess a question would be my husband and i play chess and can you give me some strategies that maybe he wont know about that i could just get in there and i mean probably not the three move strategy
corner their king
so try and make em
and how do you make them do that
and what if he catches on that im trying to move him to the corner
it sounds like it
