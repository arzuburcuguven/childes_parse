*PAR2:	place . 2027985_2028145
*PAR2:	I was just giving you example . 2028425_2029665
*PAR1:	I . 2030505_2030625
*PAR2:	know but how do you for example . 2030625_2032025
*PAR1:	but for example why do you go to the places you go to like . 2032645_2036345
*PAR1:	when you go to someplace . 2036345_2037225
*PAR1:	what's . 2037225_2037545
*PAR2:	the reason . 2037545_2037785
*PAR2:	well there's some reasons . 2037785_2038385
*PAR2:	one reason is just to kill monsters for fun . 2038965_2041505
*PAR2:	mhm . 2041565_2041985
*PAR2:	one reason is to get . 2042125_2043385
*PAR1:	does that give you anything . 2043385_2044265
*PAR1:	do you get any points for killing them . 2044485_2045865
*PAR2:	uhuh . 2046375_2046665
*PAR2:	and one thing is to kill them and get all the cachet that they give you . 2047405_2051785
*PAR2:	mhm . 2051785_2052185
*PAR2:	and &-uh one other thing is to go along and kill the monsters and get the money and go to the levels and get the Tri force and get the heart contained . 2052445_2065905
*PAR1:	so sometimes you're trying to do this so you can kill monsters . 2067555_2070535
*PAR1:	get their money . 2070635_2071375
*PAR1:	get heart containers . 2071875_2072855
*PAR1:	get more extra lives and get Tri force . 2073915_2077055
*PAR1:	but what is the purpose of the whole thing . 2077435_2079135
*PAR1:	what does the heart Tri Force get you . 2079685_2081215
*PAR2:	a cut . 2084815_2085095
*PAR2:	there's a big tri force . 2087125_2088775
*PAR2:	yeah . 2089125_2089415
*PAR2:	that &-um is in the shape of a the . 2090005_2095535
*PAR8:	shape . 2096385_2096735
*PAR8:	what's that called . 2096755_2097535
*PAR2:	triangle . 2098455_2098535
*PAR2:	yeah . 2098765_2099055
*PAR2:	in the shape of a triangle . 2099475_2100775
*PAR2:	mhm . 2100875_2101295
*PAR2:	and you once you get a piece of a Tri force you put it in <the big> [/] the big Tri force shows the piece the little piece of the Tri force . 2103035_2113815
*PAR2:	and the reason to get the Tri forces is because the [/] the you have to save the land from this from an evil person who's ruling the kingdom . 2114155_2127415
*PAR1:	and how does the Tri Force do that . 2128155_2129575
*PAR2:	it you here like you put all the pieces together . 2130985_2134885
*PAR2:	yeah . 2135035_2135325
*PAR2:	and then I [/] I think he holds the tri force up to the bad guy . 2135385_2139965
*PAR2:	and he disappears . 2140185_2141205
*PAR1:	oh is that right . 2141665_2142325
*PAR1:	yeah . 2142515_2142805
*PAR1:	have you ever done that . 2142875_2143725
*PAR2:	no way . 2144425_2144885
*PAR1:	have you ever gotten a Tri force all complete . 2145075_2147125
*PAR2:	yeah . 2148555_2148845
*PAR1:	how close did you get . 2149865_2150765
*PAR2:	even Todd has a pretty hard time getting that . 2151715_2154405
