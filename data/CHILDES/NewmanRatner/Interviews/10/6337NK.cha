*PAR0:	come sit with Mama no he thinks it is though &-um I . 94940_104720
*PAR0:	like the doll . 104720_105560
*PAR0:	he doesn't have a doll at home . 105560_106840
*PAR0:	so &-um I was actually trying to treat the doll as like a baby because my sister's gonna have a baby . 106840_112400
*PAR0:	and I don't want him poking the baby in the eye like he was with the doll . 112400_116020
*PAR0:	so he's probably wasn't terribly familiar with the doll . 116020_118740
*PAR0:	&-um and he's got some stuffed animals and stuff at home . 118740_121580
*PAR0:	just doesn't play with them much . 121660_122660
*PAR0:	he's not real interested in things that look like things . 122700_125220
*PAR0:	he yep <he likes he likes> [/] he likes his plastic toys like he has a shape sort of it . 125300_132100
*PAR0:	he loves and you know a puzzle he likes the wooden puzzles and that kind stuff . 132100_136420
*PAR0:	but like hard stuff like the squishy stuff is so not interesting to him . 136420_139640
*PAR0:	he usually likes books though he does have books at home that he likes what books did you read him . 139640_144300
*PAR0:	I read him put me in the zoo . 144300_145900
*PAR0:	and he actually seems to have more of an affinity for books that are not board books . 146140_151200
*PAR0:	he likes to turn the pages and bend them and play with them and stuff . 151760_155960

*PAR0:	in the waiting room . 181280_181960
*PAR0:	and we were like I was like chasing him around the pillar . 181960_183940
*PAR0:	and like we play like that interactively but mostly like when he's playing with toys like he kind of just does his own thing . 183940_189520
*PAR0:	and like he's like . 189520_190720
