@Date:	06-JAN-1996
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	here are some objects (.) like some that we brought (.) and we asked you &-uh (.) to play with like four years ago .
@Comment:	Time is 26:32. Video tape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
@Comment:	MOT and Chi work together fairly well; initially , MOT watches Chi play but she becomes involved in the activity and the two work together on a variety of constructions. Scientific talk about the magnets or magnetic force is very limited and usually consists of a single utterance at a time.
*INV:	and we'd like you to do that again +...
*CHI:	<oh magnets> [>] !
*INV:	+, <only this time> [<] we're also gonna &-um videotape what you do so we can see what you're doing (.) with your hands (.) while you're &-um (.) playin(g) with (th)em .
*INV:	and again (.) it'll be about ten minutes and I'll stop you .

%com:	falling magnets make it hard to hear the end of this utterance
*MOT:	it [= yellow wand] likes everything doesn't it ?
*CHI:	&=vocalization .
*MOT:	see if this'll [= silver man] stand on it [= black base] .
%act:	picks up silver man from table and moves it toward black base
*CHI:	(.) oh !
%sit:	MOT has placed the silver man on a silver stick that is sticking off the black base; it stays for a second but then falls to the table

*CHI:	oh this [= horseshoe magnet] +//.
%act:	picks up horseshoe magnet from table
*CHI:	+^ look at that !
%sit:	several magnets that are on the table (plastic balls , nuts , and a silver ball) have become stuck together in a line
%act:	picks up the ball at the end of the line; some of the other magnets remain stuck to it but others fall off and stay on the table
