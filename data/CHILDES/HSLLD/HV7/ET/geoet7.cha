@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	23-AUG-1995
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*MOT:	now the money in there is on purpose ?
@Comment:	Time is 14:07. side B
@Comment:	The mood is comfortable for this activity. EXP and EX2 remain in the background and do not participate in the discussion between Mot and Chi. Mot does the vast majority of the talking; Chi's longest utterance is about six words and most of his utterances are one to three word answers to questions which were posed by Mot. Mot spends a good deal of time talking to Chi about the scientific ideas behind magnetism , reminding him that they had read something about it previously. Unfortunately , MOT doesn't remember the general idea , that opposites attract and like poles repel , and it's hard to tell if Chi knows this since he doesn't verbalize it clearly. The final part of the activity is spent building a structure
*MOT:	&=laughs [>] .
*EX2:	&=laughs [<] [>] .
*INV:	&=laughs [<] .
*INV:	you can't keep the money .
*EX2:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	www .
%sit:	talks more about the money
*MOT:	oh wow .
*CHI:	(.) what ?
%sit:	<$=30> EXP and EX2 whisper to one another; at points their conversation overpowers Mot and Chi's
*MOT:	that's [= black base] a strong magnet .
*CHI:	very strong .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	don't hurt yourself .
*MOT:	(.) does that [= plastic turtle] open ?
*MOT:	the magnet's inside here [= black base] .
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	watch .
%act:	puts black base down on table
*MOT:	do you think +//.
*MOT:	is the magnet inserted in here [= black base] ?
*CHI:	xxx .
*MOT:	how can they tell if it's [= black base?] &-um +...
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	places nickel on black base
*MOT:	see how it [= nickel] moves around ?
*MOT:	+^ watch .
%act:	picks up black base and shakes it; causing nickel to slide back and forth across its surface
*MOT:	right .
*MOT:	+^ how can you test it [= magnet in black base?] ?
*MOT:	like maybe put it [= nickel] (.) here +...
%act:	points to a corner of the black base
*MOT:	versus over here (be)cause +...
*MOT:	+^ wait .
%act:	points to opposite corner of black base
*MOT:	+^ we just put the magnet on this side ?
*MOT:	to see if there's a difference .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	puts nickel down on base; tilts base to one side; nickel slides across it and falls off
*CHI:	nope .
*MOT:	does the coin +//.
*MOT:	yeah .
*MOT:	the coin's not staying with it .
*MOT:	+^ try that on the other side of the (.) coin .
%act:	picks up black base and turns it over
*MOT:	try this one .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	puts nickel on black base
*MOT:	will the coin stay ?
%sit:	the coin falls off the black base
*CHI:	nope .
*MOT:	let's try one that we know works .
%act:	clears off silver circle and moves it across table; picks up yellow wand and begins to pull magnets off it
*CHI:	this [?] .
%act:	tilts black base back and forth; there is a nut on it that the Chi has placed there
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	why don't you make one of your creations ?
*MOT:	xxx awesome configurations that you make .
*CHI:	oh yeah .
*MOT:	xxx terrific .
*MOT:	here's a stick .
%act:	picks up silver stick and hands it to Chi
*MOT:	(.) whoa &=laughs !
*MOT:	wow !
%act:	waves yellow wand over black base
*MOT:	look at that [= yellow wand over the base] !
*MOT:	+^ oh Chi .
*MOT:	feel that .
%act:	hands yellow wand to Chi
*MOT:	what's happen(ing) there ?
*MOT:	whaddya [: what do you] think (i)s goin(g) on ?
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	waves yellow wand over black base; brings it close and wand sticks to base
*MOT:	whoa !
*EX2:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	why did it do that ?
*CHI:	(be)cause the magnet's on this side .
%act:	indicates one side of the base with the wand
*MOT:	well the magnet's on (.) both sides .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	moves the yellow wand to the other side of the black base; it sticks
*MOT:	but what you &~s +//.
*MOT:	remember what you learned about &-um +...
*MOT:	what was it in that [/] that [//] the book we read about (.) magnets and electromagnetic energy ?
*MOT:	d(o) ya [: you] remember what it said about (.) &-um (.) positive and negative (.) connections ?
*MOT:	do you remember what that said ?
*CHI:	no .
%act:	continues to stick wand to black base and pull it off
*MOT:	0 [=! strange vocalization] .
%act:	grabs Chi's head and moves it up and down with hands

*MOT:	about the positive and negative (.) whatever waves ?
*CHI:	&=vocalization .
*MOT:	(.) how it caused [?] +...
*MOT:	you know .
*MOT:	some attract and some repel ?
*MOT:	do you remember that ?
*CHI:	yes .
*MOT:	positive and negative (.) energy ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	so what do you think (i)s goin(g) on here ?
%act:	holds up yellow wand and points it toward the black base
*MOT:	(be)cause these are magnets just like what we read about .
%act:	indicates the other objects on the table with the yellow wand
*CHI:	I know .
*MOT:	do you remember what it said about (.) positives and negatives ?
*MOT:	hm: ?
*CHI:	&-uh yeah .
%act:	puts silver circle on black base; places two silver men in standing positions on silver circle
*MOT:	wha(t) did it say ?
*MOT:	+^ (be)cause that'll help explain why this [//] on this side what is it doin(g) ?
%act:	taps the top of the black base with the yellow wand
*MOT:	compared to this side ?
%act:	taps the side of the black base with the yellow wand
*CHI:	(o)kay [=? wait] .
*MOT:	hm: ?
*CHI:	hm: .
*CHI:	it's makin(g) it (.) &-um +...
%act:	places another silver man on the black base
*CHI:	&-um .
*CHI:	I don't know .
%act:	places a fourth silver man on the black base
*MOT:	wait a minute .
*MOT:	you know what ?
*MOT:	+^ I asked you to make one of these neat figures .
%act:	reaches over and pulls black base away from Chi toward her
*MOT:	I really want you to .
*MOT:	+^ but I just want you to figure this out for a minute first .
*MOT:	okay ?
*MOT:	can you do that ?
*MOT:	+^ just for a minute ?
*MOT:	+^ and then you can do that ?
*CHI:	wait a sec(ond) .
%act:	attempts to finish arranging silver men on black base
*MOT:	just [//] I just want you to answer me this .
*MOT:	(be)cause that'll help you figure a lot .
%act:	moves yellow wand toward black base
*MOT:	why is it that this one <pushes off [?]> [//] pushes away from here [= the top of the black base] and that it's [= the yellow wand] attracting there [= side of the black base] .
%gpx:	points to the top and side of the black base with the yellow wand as she refers to them in her speech
*CHI:	(be)cause this is a (.) positive +...
%act:	taps top of black base
*CHI:	this one's negative .
%act:	taps yellow wand

%act:	holds hand out toward base
*MOT:	and one combination of (th)em repel right ?
*EX2:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	cool .
%act:	moves yellow wand toward side of black base; black base slides across the table away from the wand
*MOT:	you can actually +//.
*MOT:	do you think you could move like (.) move a car that way ?
*MOT:	if you put that [= yellow wand?] in the engine +...
*MOT:	and you put it on wheels ?
*MOT:	and made it move .
*MOT:	look .
%act:	grabs Chi's hand on wand and moves wand over the top of the base
*CHI:	that's not the one !
*MOT:	you think you could though ?
*MOT:	with that kind of energy ?
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	resumes action of using yellow wand to push base across the table
*MOT:	see <how you> [//] how [//] see how you make it move ?
*MOT:	without even touchin(g) it ?
*MOT:	wouldn't that be neat if you could like (.) power a car that way ?
*MOT:	and you wouldn't need any gas ?
*MOT:	how do you think you could do that xxx ?
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	moves yellow wand to top of black base and picks it up

*MOT:	put the wheels on the side .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	takes black base from Mot's hands
*MOT:	+^ imagine you could glue them on and they would turn .
*MOT:	right ?
*MOT:	do you think you could make it [= black base] roll ?
*MOT:	with this [= yellow wand] [//] just this electric [//] magnetic energy ?
*MOT:	do you think ?
*CHI:	maybe .
%act:	is attempting to stick washers to side of black base
*MOT:	I think that's kinda [= kind of] neat .
*CHI:	do you ?
*MOT:	well I forget what combinations of positive and negatives it is but we could look that up .
*CHI:	hm: .
*MOT:	why don't you make a platform <for your> [/] for your &-uh stage ?
%act:	picks up silver circle
*MOT:	now do this .

*MOT:	if you could keep [/] keep it [= silver man] suspended .
*MOT:	above (.) something .
%act:	points to yellow wand
*MOT:	+^ like being pulled with the magnetic (.) energy this way .
%act:	grabs silver man and attempts to attach it to the under side of the yellow wand above the black base
*MOT:	right ?
*MOT:	watch [>] .
*CHI:	this [//] [<] it could stand up like that .
%act:	takes silver man from Mot and puts it on the black base
*MOT:	but to have that +//.

%act:	tries both sides of yellow wand on black base
*CHI:	it's not the same .
*MOT:	it's not ?
*MOT:	is one repeling and one attracting ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	what_about the sides ?
%act:	points to the sides of the yellow wand
*CHI:	sides are (.) stayin(g) +...
%act:	moves one side of the yellow wand down toward the black base; it pushes away; then flips the wand and tries the other side; it sticks and pulls the silver man who had been on the black base to it
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	they're different too .
*MOT:	(.) hm: .
*MOT:	try and make [/] make one of your figures .
*MOT:	you know ?
*MOT:	some awesome things .

%act:	places coins on black base; then tips base so they all slide off
*MOT:	how (a)bout on the back side of the magnet ?
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up black base and holds it above coins; coins don't move , but the large silver circle slides across the table and sticks to it
*MOT:	whoa !
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*EX2:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	okay .
*MOT:	we'll stop .
*MOT:	you can make your design now .

%act:	begins to stack silver men one on top of another on the platform
*MOT:	(..) whoa .
*CHI:	are there any others [= silver men] ?
*MOT:	now imagine if they [= silver men] weren't magnetic .
*MOT:	they [= silver men] wouldn't stay up too well would they ?
*CHI:	I know .
*MOT:	what are you lookin(g) for ?
*CHI:	I'm lookin(g) for another person .
