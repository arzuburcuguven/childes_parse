@Comment:	MOT and Chi play well together; EXP stays in the background. Mot and Chi spend most of their time experimenting with the magnets. They discuss how strong the magnets are , they try to find out how close the magnet must be to an object before the object will move toward the magnet , and finally , they get out a children's book which covers science topics in order to see what makes the magnet work. Although Mot asks many of the questions , it is Chi who goes to get the science book without being prompted. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
*MOT:	this is actually &-um <a xxx> [//] just ah what the thing looked like +...
*MOT:	+^ the essay [?] .
*INV:	www .
