*PAR0:	alright . 0_2000
*PAR0:	well we're going ask you a few questions now . 2000_3940
*PAR0:	okay . 4560_4600
*PAR0:	&-um so what do you think she was most interested in . 5360_8140
*PAR0:	probably this pizza that she still has in her hands . 8220_10700
*PAR0:	it seems like these kinds of toys which she hasn't played with before . 10900_18300
*PAR0:	she's never really seen these kinds of toys is what's piquing her interest . 18380_21420
*PAR0:	do you think that's because of the texture or the colors . 23160_25460
*PAR0:	&-um I partly wonder if it's because it looks like food . 26560_31360
*PAR0:	and she recognizes it as food . 31360_32880
*PAR0:	I don't know if that's giving her too much credit . 33000_34460
*PAR0:	but does she eat any of this food at home . 34920_38460
*PAR0:	she's only eating pureed foods . 38620_41160
*PAR0:	she eats at the dinner table when we eat . 41460_44000
*PAR0:	so I don't know if it she recognized that's what goes in my belly or [/] or if it's just a fun texture . 44000_51760
*PAR0:	and it's a triangle . 51760_53860
*PAR0:	do you have any of these you read books at home . 55320_78720
*PAR0:	does she have a favorite one . 78720_80680
*PAR0:	she &-um what do we read big as a doll head . 80680_118440
*PAR0:	but then the body is kind of like a rag . 118460_123440
*PAR0:	I don't know . 123440_124940
*PAR0:	it's not one of those loveys like the blanket ones . 124940_128300
*PAR0:	it's smaller . 128300_129780
*PAR0:	but does she get along with the dog . 129780_146240
*PAR0:	yeah very well . 146240_147220
*PAR0:	&-um but Sally's usually in her face when we're on the floor and playing . 147220_152720
*PAR0:	which she doesn't mind . 152720_154520
*PAR0:	but she never really gets to focus because then she gets distracted by the dog . 155600_160340
*PAR0:	so that's mostly what she's paying attention to . 160580_162560
*PAR0:	how does she have any siblings . 166180_168140
*PAR0:	nope . 168700_168920

*PAR0:	the least out of all the toys . 174240_177400
*PAR0:	she didn't seem to care too much . 177400_178440
*PAR0:	for those &-uh sheep and zebra magnet stuffed animals . 178440_184740
*PAR0:	&-uh do you this is gonna sound silly . 184740_194800
*PAR0:	do you eat any of this food at home that maybe she'd recognize like real food . 194800_199600
*PAR0:	&-um yeah pretty much everything that's here . 199600_204140
*PAR0:	I mean I'm not quite sure what these meats are . 204140_205680

*PAR0:	&-um it's just a round teether but it's got little rattles on the inside . 242400_246200
*PAR0:	and she tends to like anything that she can shake in her hand . 246400_249620
*PAR0:	she is big on but she does sleep with the lovey puppy . 249620_256320
*PAR0:	that's more of a soothing toy . 256320_258780
*PAR0:	if she's upset she likes to have it . 258780_260060
*PAR0:	but she doesn't really play with it . 260060_265520
