okay great
-uh can you name any famous chess players
that is just fine
you are too busy playing chess rather than watching it and reading about it

okay and then what is after that
and then next to them
the queen
okay so now tell me about the goals of chess in other words what are the players trying to do
so now tell me the rules that players need to follow in other words tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so that someone who has never played before would know how to play
is that a strategy that a lot of kids your age know about

all right so lets see
so now i would like you to tell me about what a player should do in order to win the game of chess in other words what are some key strategies that every good player should know
and we sort of did that a little bit i guess but are there some other more basic strategies

games that you have played yourself
okay but about an hour is your max
and what makes a game last a long time
