*PAR0:	&-um what do you think Billy liked the most today . 0_7780
*PAR0:	&-um I think he was interested in the doll because we don't have a doll at home . 7780_12460
*PAR0:	&-um and the bottle I &-uh was he was trying to drink the bottle &-um which is kind of funny because yeah I breastfeed him . 12460_22280
*PAR0:	so . 22280_22560
*PAR0:	and but he seemed to know what to do with it . 22980_25160
*PAR0:	and &-um and the bits of food he wasn't so interested in the cuddly toys or his interest in the play food the waffle and the grapes . 25400_35120
*PAR0:	so what [/] what would you say was his least favorite the &-um cuddly toys I think . 36160_42860
*PAR0:	do you think he was familiar with any of the animals that you presented to him . 42860_48560
*PAR0:	&-um I would say . 48560_51420
*PAR0:	no we don't have a kangaroo . 51420_53280
*PAR0:	we don't have bumblebee . 53280_54680
*PAR0:	so no [/] no . 54680_57000
*PAR0:	&-uh did you play with the chicken . 58240_59580
*PAR0:	well I put it in front of him . 60200_61260
*PAR0:	but I didn't really present it to him so to speak . 61260_63640
*PAR0:	so <he didn't> [/] he didn't go to play with it . 63640_66680
*PAR0:	okay . 67220_67480
*PAR0:	how about any of the food . 68600_70140
*PAR0:	do you think he recognized the names or the look of any of the food . 70220_73720
*PAR0:	&-um I know he likes food . 74560_77120
*PAR0:	so &-uh I don't know that he would necessarily recognize you know like a slice of pizza . 77460_84560
*PAR0:	but I think he might realize it is food you know or pretend food . 84560_88020
*PAR0:	and think that there's something in it for him . 88020_91160
*PAR0:	or maybe it's just the texture or the feel of it . 91160_93920
*PAR0:	I don't know . 93920_94500
*PAR0:	&-um he liked the grapes a lot . 94500_97100
*PAR0:	he [/] he seemed to be grabbing at them . 97100_100020
*PAR0:	okay . 100020_101520
*PAR0:	you think it's the texture the color or . 101520_104240
*PAR0:	the sound was he doing any like . 104240_106420
*PAR0:	what type of playing was he doing with the food . 106420_110060
*PAR0:	&-uh while he was touching and feeling it . 110060_111900
*PAR0:	and then he was trying to put the grapes in his mouth and the spaghetti . 111900_114180
*PAR0:	so I think it's a combination of the colors . 114680_121540
*PAR0:	and they're smaller pieces so he can pick them up easier to grasp than the cuddly toys . 121540_128600
*PAR0:	and like I say maybe he thought it was genuine food . 128600_131780
*PAR0:	so he was checking it out . 131780_134880
*PAR0:	so you have play food at home . 134880_136440
*PAR0:	no we don't . 136480_137040
*PAR0:	no . 137040_137220
*PAR0:	how about &-um and then he's not familiar with the bible . 138180_141680
*PAR0:	you said . 141680_142320
*PAR0:	no . 142600_143040
*PAR0:	well at the weekends when I go to work he is but not when I'm around he's not . 143040_147880
*PAR0:	mhm . 148040_148260
*PAR0:	yeah . 148440_148660
*PAR0:	&-uh how about books at home . 149760_151220
*PAR0:	do you read . 151340_152280
*PAR0:	do you tend to read books . 152280_154200
*PAR0:	yeah I do . 154780_155480
*PAR0:	but I tend to read more to his brother but include him when I'm reading . 155480_160340
*PAR0:	so they'd be kind of more I slightly older books than those ones . 160340_164440
*PAR0:	here . 164440_165580
*PAR0:	do you own any of these at home . 165580_168340

*PAR0:	so does he like that . 185180_187240
*PAR0:	mhm yeah . 187240_188300
*PAR0:	does he tend to like to play with toys more than because you know they're playing around the two of them . 188300_205540
*PAR0:	and then when I do storytime it's you know maybe half an hour or whatever . 205540_208920
*PAR0:	so he probably gets to play more and explore . 208920_213140
*PAR0:	you know he's at that stage where it's not just toys . 213140_216440
*PAR0:	it's crawling to see whatever he can find . 216440_218480

*PAR0:	sorry to go back to that . 260200_261320
