*PAR0:	would it be more comfortable for you to be there or in the chair at the moment . 5060_9460
*PAR0:	let me just stay here . 9460_10860
*PAR0:	alright . 10860_11900
*PAR0:	I'll see if I had my broken leg . 11900_32860
*PAR0:	my husband was shopping . 32860_33980
*PAR0:	so they would go shopping together . 33980_35380
*PAR0:	and so she's into shopping . 35380_37960
*PAR0:	so she knows like they get cans . 37960_41060
*PAR0:	she wouldn't call them cans . 41060_42000
*PAR0:	but she knew she needed these . 42000_43240
*PAR0:	and we buy cans . 43240_44100
*PAR0:	and she was you know gathering the things she knows we buy . 44100_50060
*PAR0:	and you know and then she [/] she was looking at baby dolls which has been her big thing lately . 50060_55320
*PAR0:	and she likes to change her diapers . 55320_57860
*PAR0:	and like you know she needs her diaper changed usually . 57860_61940
*PAR0:	but she wants to change her baby's diapers and [/] and that sort of stuff . 62580_68860
*PAR0:	so that sort of made sense . 68900_70080
*PAR0:	and then she was into cook wanting to cook . 70200_73400
*PAR0:	she tries to help cook at home . 73480_75160
*PAR0:	so I can see that . 75300_76600
*PAR0:	and then we have a pizza cutter for pizza . 76680_78820
*PAR0:	she knows that you know we make pizza . 79540_81400
*PAR0:	and she you cut the pizza and stuff like that . 81580_83760
*PAR0:	but it seemed like all of these things . 84280_86240
*PAR0:	she thought of them as items she bought . 86240_88180
*PAR0:	and she wasn't really interested in going in the bags . 88440_90920
*PAR0:	and you know like I'd show her <you know> [/] you know ask her about the zebra . 91080_94320
*PAR0:	and she'd throw the zebra there . 94440_95420
*PAR0:	and I'm like . 95500_95900
*PAR0:	do you wanna cook the zebra [/] zebra . 95900_97760
*PAR0:	but she wasn't really interested in what was in the containers which is kind of different than . 97760_103440
*PAR0:	well last time I don't know you're going spit . 103440_105840
*PAR0:	my talk . 105840_106180
*PAR0:	sorry . 106180_107220
*PAR0:	last time we didn't have like containers or anything . 107220_109680
*PAR0:	they were just sort of loose . 109680_110720
*PAR0:	and she would sort of each time has been different or what she's done with the animals . 110720_116100
*PAR0:	this is sort of the first time she's actually out and out ignore them . 116100_118580
*PAR0:	&-um yeah she was definitely very into the cooking and the laughing . 119940_123300
*PAR0:	&-um . 123300_123880
*PAR0:	so you said she watches you cook at home . 123880_127340
*PAR0:	and she tries to help . 127940_128740
*PAR0:	okay . 128900_129140
*PAR0:	does she like watching you cook anything specific or is just well like she know like the family makes pizza together . 129900_136440
*PAR0:	so she knows about that . 136440_137600
*PAR0:	and then yesterday like her brother had a friend over . 137600_140160
*PAR0:	so we all made fudge together . 140160_141400
*PAR0:	so &-um mean she [/] she just wants to help like she wants to stir and that sort of stuff . 141400_147900
*PAR0:	but like we have an electric stove . 147900_149860
*PAR0:	so I was sort of reminding her . 149860_150780
*PAR0:	you can't have you know put your hands down and be careful with the pots pot . 150780_153820
*PAR0:	so don't get burned . 153820_155580
*PAR0:	&-um so sort of it's like it's sort of the thing that kind of was the common theme is the thing she's interested in right now which is sort of playing with baby dolls and playing with cooking and shopping and so and anything else beyond that is sort of I mean she likes books and all . 155580_175680
*PAR0:	but that I mean you saw when as soon as she pulled them out first thing she goes play with the baby doll . 175680_180360
*PAR0:	and she wanted to go play with the baby doll . 180520_181840
*PAR0:	yeah . 182000_182180
*PAR0:	so some of this food is was there anything that maybe she hadn't seen before . 183120_188000
*PAR0:	any new food . 188360_188880
*PAR0:	no . 189540_190100
*PAR0:	well the Kiwi is . 190300_191620
*PAR0:	something we don't eat . 191620_193000
*PAR0:	and so she didn't really know what to do with it . 193000_196320
*PAR0:	because she's trying to cut it and can't figure out why it's not cutting . 196320_199220
*PAR0:	but I was surprised . 199220_200760
*PAR0:	she even knew that it was something you cut because it's not something we eat . 200760_204900
*PAR0:	&-um I mean like the pe the foods generally like I was surprised . 204900_209180
*PAR0:	she knew what green beans were . 209180_210300
*PAR0:	I mean we have it occasionally at home . 210300_212460
*PAR0:	but her brothers hate it . 212460_213440
*PAR0:	and so does her husband so does my husband . 213540_214840
*PAR0:	so they always are like . 215020_216440
*PAR0:	we don't like those . 216440_217220
*PAR0:	so when she said they were beans I was kinda surprised . 217260_219080
*PAR0:	&-um but like you know the meats and stuff like that . 219660_224600
*PAR0:	she knows I don't think she has any clue what this is . 225160_228280
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah I mean it's that's not [/] not something [/] something . 228940_233140
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah it's not something we have around the house . 233200_235500
*PAR0:	&-um so [/] so I wasn't [/] wasn't surprised . 235500_240820
*PAR0:	she had no clue and didn't even focus on it . 240820_242960
*PAR0:	I mean she knows w she didn't go for them . 242960_245100
*PAR0:	she was just more into I wanna shop . 245100_246780
*PAR0:	so I mean she knows about cans . 246780_248440
*PAR0:	and she knows meat and that sort of stuff . 248440_251180
*PAR0:	but it wasn't like she wanted to put it in her basket . 251180_254300
*PAR0:	and because you know how giant has the little baskets and stuff like and the kid's baskets . 254680_258040
*PAR0:	so she gets all of that . 258260_259240
*PAR0:	so &-um and does she have baby dolls at home . 260020_263100
*PAR0:	yes . 263340_263680
*PAR0:	and &-um she really didn't get into them until the last few months . 263980_269460
*PAR0:	like the last time <we were> [/] we were here I guess at eighteen months that's what . 269460_274100
*PAR0:	about the time she started to even look at them before that she could care less . 274100_279380
*PAR0:	and then lately she's been more into holding the baby and changing the baby and feeding the baby [/] baby and [/] and all [/] all that [/] that sort [/] sort of [/] of stuff [/] stuff . 279920_287620
*PAR0:	&-um &-um does she [/] she usually use the likes to put like clothes on [/] on herself . 288540_292920
*PAR0:	she mostly strips them and then put diapers on . 293360_295340
*PAR0:	and then you know walks around . 295460_297020
*PAR0:	oh and she likes to get diaper . 297280_299000
*PAR0:	cream . 299000_299360
*PAR0:	and she goes the baby needs diaper cream on her bottom . 299520_301680
*PAR0:	and which is a little disturbing because she's like . 302400_306640
*PAR0:	gotta . 306640_307120
*PAR0:	and she wants to put lotion on the baby . 307440_309160
*PAR0:	and she needs lotion . 309160_310440
*PAR0:	she has dry skin . 310440_311160
*PAR0:	but she's like the baby needs lotion . 311160_312960
*PAR0:	and yeah but watching her change to baby doll the other day was kind of interesting . 312960_317860
*PAR0:	she goes . 317860_318220
*PAR0:	oh and I need to go get wipes . 318220_319640
*PAR0:	I need to wipe the baby's bottom . 319640_321720
*PAR0:	and I'm like you need to go to potty . 321720_323860
*PAR0:	&-um so but she doesn't really spend time dressing it was mostly stripping hugging kissing feeding diving diapering . 324400_336220
*PAR0:	but like this is the putting clothes on as most I've ever seen her do putting clothes on because she didn't normally do that . 336220_344500
*PAR0:	and were there any other toys that maybe any of the animals anything you tried to get her to play with that . 345680_350220
*PAR0:	she wasn't really interested in . 350220_352420
*PAR0:	no I think she would have been more interested in this if she had could figure out instantly whether or it was a puzzle . 353220_358240
*PAR0:	&-um because it was first thing she sort of said is [/] is it a puzzle . 359180_362100
*PAR0:	and then . 362220_362400
*PAR0:	she's looking down looking for like . 362400_363760
*PAR0:	what where's the design to put the pieces in . 363760_366220
*PAR0:	and she's like . 366220_367020
*PAR0:	oh there's the baby doll . 367020_368260
*PAR0:	where's the pot . 368900_369880
*PAR0:	so yeah I think she would have been more interested in that . 370100_372980
*PAR0:	then . 373240_373480
*PAR0:	&-um she [/] she didn't seem to get the tool thing . 373480_381280
*PAR0:	&-um I and I don't know why it was kind of weird . 381940_386620
*PAR0:	but she may she didn't seem to be interested in that . 386620_389780
*PAR0:	she was thinking this was more of a bib . 390000_391160
*PAR0:	oh okay . 391700_392280
*PAR0:	&-um but she as you know I was trying to get her to focus on hammer and that sort of stuff . 392840_397560
*PAR0:	she's like . 397640_398120
*PAR0:	where's the baby . 398120_399580
*PAR0:	where's the cooking which is [/] is funny [/] funny because she has older brothers . 399580_404140
*PAR0:	and she plays I mean a lot of her toys are her brother's toys that they had . 404140_408900
*PAR0:	and we just have kept them all . 408900_410380
*PAR0:	so she you know hammers on like the little workbench sort of thing and that sort of stuff . 410380_416920
*PAR0:	but she didn't seem to focus that much on it . 416920_419760
*PAR0:	so is there any other I mean besides the toys any other toys that she has at home that we didn't have here that she usually plays with &-um toys . 420900_429380
*PAR0:	she's [/] she's &-um into like the little she has a little &-um little einstein rocket car . 429380_443760
*PAR0:	so she kinda goes around the house and plays with that . 443760_446940
*PAR0:	or she got like a trampoline for Christmas a little [/] little one for her . 446940_450740
*PAR0:	and so she kinda plays with that now . 450920_453280
*PAR0:	and she jumps on that . 453420_454560
*PAR0:	and [/] and &-um her brothers play hockey . 454720_458920
*PAR0:	so you know there many sticks around the house . 459100_461180
*PAR0:	so she does that . 461180_462180
*PAR0:	and she plays with . 462180_462940
*PAR0:	balls . 462940_463440
*PAR0:	&-um so you know she kicks the ball and does that sort of stuff . 464400_467900
*PAR0:	&-um tiny things toys per say . 468540_471200
*PAR0:	&-um I mean she likes more of the manipulative books . 472460_475960
*PAR0:	so like she likes [/] likes these and you know she knows Goodnight Moon but like Santa brought her a potty training book that has like a little button that you know you hear the toilet flushing . 476660_488180
*PAR0:	or &-um the Thomas Tank Engine books that you know if you see the picture you push and you get a noise right that [/] that sort of stuff she likes with books . 488180_497260
*PAR0:	I mean she'll usually sit down I think maybe she was getting a little sure it's [/] it's been a long day . 497300_501720
*PAR0:	yeah . 501720_501900
*PAR0:	&-um was there anything you noticed today about her . 503280_506460
*PAR0:	play that &-um was a little different from what she normally does or was it pretty much it's it more . 506460_512020
*PAR0:	it's the [/] the difference was more from what she did the last time we here I mean it's the play was definitely on what she's interested in . 512020_519760
*PAR0:	now the it was funny like as we've done this the first time she was really attracted to color like the bright stuff she was focused on if it was red or orange or pink . 519760_530120
*PAR0:	she was there . 530120_531660
*PAR0:	it couldn't she recognized sort of was starting to recognize food . 531660_537360
*PAR0:	but it was more that the bright colors . 537360_539360
*PAR0:	that's where she was . 539540_540080
*PAR0:	and then the next time it was more she was into the animals and things that she recognized and food and stuff . 540580_545220
*PAR0:	like she wasn't how to say she wasn't putting everything together . 545220_548380
*PAR0:	okay . 548660_548920
*PAR0:	versus now she could sort of see her focus on . 549140_553460
*PAR0:	something . 553460_553820
*PAR0:	and it sort of fits into a an area versus what she used to do . 553820_559560
*PAR0:	so like she'll play with the dolls and like have something do or she's like . 559860_562960
*PAR0:	okay I'm going shopping . 562960_563860
*PAR0:	and I'm doing all of that versus like the first time she's like you know I n I see pizza you know when she was talking pizza or this or that but she wouldn't go . 563860_573880
*PAR0:	and next thing . 574000_574540
*PAR0:	okay . 574620_574800
*PAR0:	let me go find the things to go on the pizza or let me go take it to the stove sort of thing . 574800_578540
*PAR0:	&-um but the other thing is the toys are a little bit more mature too . 579160_582460
*PAR0:	yeah . 582780_583200
*PAR0:	I ever tried to do that . 583200_583940
*PAR0:	yeah . 584120_584440
*PAR0:	cause I [/] I remember the pot . 584900_586140
*PAR0:	these things weren't here . 586280_587140
*PAR0:	this was here before but this wasn't here before . 587240_589900
*PAR0:	and as I mentioned these were and first of all and I think they were little puzzles before which she would play with . 590240_598160
*PAR0:	and so great . 598160_601020
*PAR0:	<she did a> [/] she did a great job today . 601700_603520
