@Comment:	MOT is involved in the play at some points but is frequently distracted by her cat and by conversation with the EXP. She occasionally directs activities and does make some attempt to engage in science talk with Chi about the pull of the magnets. The cat is present during most of the activity and causes disruption in the flow of play
