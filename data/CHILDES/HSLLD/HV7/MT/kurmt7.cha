@Comment:	At this meal were Chi , MOT , and Chi's younger Sis. The radio was on very loudly in the background throughout the taping session , making the speakers very hard to hear. There was very minimal conversation between Mot , Chi , and Sis. They talked about routine , mundane things. Chi and Sis would ask Mot if they could do something and Mot would reply , MOT at one point asked Sis if she had taken her medicine , and so on. Towards the end of the session , SIS called her friend on the phone.
