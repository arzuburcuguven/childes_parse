@Comment:	MOT and Chi discuss Chi's favorite part of Eric Carle's book. Mot helps Chi spell a few words (but declines to help spell sincerely) , comments on his punctuation , and discusses topics to include in the letter. In a conversation with INV she says the study has become a fun staple of their life even though their only meets with INV once or twice a year. Despite lots_of extra conversation , which Chi participates in , he writes the letter independently and well (but gives Mot due credit as a collaborator). Mot uses sophisticated vocabulary (traumatized , remission; talking about a cat , mind you) in conversation with INV. Mot and Chi seem to have a very warm relationship. Letter is in cursive.
