*PAR0:	sure . 8720_9000
*PAR0:	oh okay . 9000_11660
*PAR0:	&-um I think that she liked all these little toys . 11660_15380
*PAR0:	she doesn't have any of these at home . 15380_17080
*PAR0:	so they were all kind of new . 17080_18900
*PAR0:	and I really think that she liked the stacking and watching them fall down like the sound . 18900_24440
*PAR0:	right . 24440_26020
*PAR0:	I &-um tried to keep them all out of her mouth . 26020_30300
*PAR0:	I think the goal for her was trying to eat them . 30300_32620
*PAR0:	and I think I was trying to keep them away . 32620_35180
*PAR0:	I [/] I think from the you've told it on stage . 35180_37820
*PAR0:	yeah . 37820_38080
*PAR0:	okay . 38080_38640
*PAR0:	fascination . 38640_39500
*PAR0:	but umto give her play with these at first . 39500_51960
*PAR0:	but they were kind of boring . 51960_52960
*PAR0:	it looked it seemed like she was like . 52960_54320
*PAR0:	yeah that's kind of nice . 54320_55360
*PAR0:	and then she liked the baby . 55360_57080
*PAR0:	I [/] I think that &-uh she wanted to attack the baby for a [/] a little while . 57380_61260
*PAR0:	and I couldn't decide if I was it was overstimulating her with all the different things . 61260_65740
*PAR0:	&-um but she seemed to have more pleasure with [/] with [/] with these toys . 65740_72180
*PAR0:	the ones that made a clack the yeah the made noise . 73080_75280
*PAR0:	yeah exactly . 75480_76240
*PAR0:	&-um so you don't think she recognizes any of them . 76680_79120
*PAR0:	I guess some of them don't actually look like what they're supposed to look like . 79260_81440
*PAR0:	right . 81440_82000
*PAR0:	I don't no I don't think that she recognizes it because we don't really have any of these type of foods or you know right . 82000_89940
*PAR0:	so that's a good idea for me to give her some like little things to show her different colors . 90080_93440
*PAR0:	I oh not the colors of some things . 94440_96080
*PAR0:	I just so I read those to her . 96160_107140
*PAR0:	&-um like the and [/] and I say the colors to her . 107140_109880
*PAR0:	but I don't know if it's I'm s I'm . 110440_111660
*PAR0:	s I I'm trying to [/] to get that going to for her to recognize it different colors . 111660_115760
*PAR0:	she's excited . 116500_118020
*PAR0:	yeah green [/] green . 118020_122760
*PAR0:	I also try to push them away so she can go to them . 122760_130000
*PAR0:	so I'm trying to get her to kind of see if she goes after stuff a little bit more . 130000_135620
*PAR0:	so she's [/] she's pretty mobile . 135620_137400
*PAR0:	I would say . 137400_138040
*PAR0:	mhm . 138140_138480
*PAR0:	smart [/] smart . 139060_140020
*PAR0:	oh she's from the books . 140720_141720
*PAR0:	do you read to her a lot of books . 142500_143660
*PAR0:	yeah . 143840_144500
*PAR0:	I read to her at home . 144500_146120
*PAR0:	I don't know why I didn't choose to read to her today . 146280_149700
*PAR0:	I don't know . 150140_151060
*PAR0:	I felt like I wanted d for her to explore something new besides the books because that's the only and besides the stackable color things that we have at home . 151820_159220
*PAR0:	these were kind of new . 159220_160340
*PAR0:	but I read to her a lot . 161600_162820
*PAR0:	&-um just like one two three we have the touch [/] touch and feel books . 163880_168320
*PAR0:	good night moon and all the little harder books . 168640_172120
*PAR0:	she likes to eat them . 172580_173580
*PAR0:	and I think that's why I didn't want to read to him because <I was> [/] I was trying to keep stuff out of her mouth . 173840_177980
*PAR0:	oh okay . 178160_181080
*PAR0:	just sanitize . 183940_185580
*PAR0:	sanitize . 185740_186360
*PAR0:	okay . 186520_186940
*PAR0:	okay . 188700_190280
*PAR0:	&-um do you think she recognizes any of the fuzzy book I think that she recognized right away because she screamed when she saw it at first I think that she like had some kind of connection with it because she has that same book . 191860_209740
*PAR0:	yeah this book . 209740_210780
*PAR0:	yeah . 210780_213280
*PAR0:	when she saw that she kind of like . 213280_216280
*PAR0:	ah I know that book . 216280_217960
*PAR0:	mhm no we don't . 217960_230180
*PAR0:	have any dolls . 230180_231300
*PAR0:	she has some stuffed animals but they're not this small . 231300_234060
*PAR0:	her stuffed animals are kinda big . 234200_235780
*PAR0:	they're large . 235940_237140
*PAR0:	&-um and she plays with it you know like the [/] the pillow that's a pillow . 237560_243340
*PAR0:	and it's also a bumblebee . 243340_244520
*PAR0:	then she has like a giant ape . 244780_246440
*PAR0:	she has all these big animals . 246900_249420
*PAR0:	so all these were little [/] little maybe that's why she didn't really get into those . 249540_254100
*PAR0:	I'm not sure . 254100_255660
*PAR0:	I don't know if she recognized them . 255660_257600
*PAR0:	we have this but it's a lot bigger . 257600_262720
*PAR0:	yeah . 262720_263180
*PAR0:	so what here's the lady again . 263180_269420
*PAR0:	the little baby's back to play with you . 269420_275060
*PAR0:	hey friend . 275060_279060
*PAR0:	you're my size . 279060_283080
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 283080_289180
*PAR0:	no I think mostly if she recognized it would just be by color . 289180_296340
*PAR0:	so these things . 296340_297480
*PAR0:	yeah no not really I think that she likes for some reason . 297480_310000
*PAR0:	I feel like she likes reds &-um because we have those stackable colors . 310000_316080
*PAR0:	and she always hold on to the those the red one . 316080_318560
*PAR0:	but I can't decide if it's because of the color or because of the size because the red is the smallest one . 318560_322720
*PAR0:	it's on top . 322720_323380
*PAR0:	and the giraffe . 323740_327240
*PAR0:	she has a red giraffe over there that she always that's the one that she cries for . 327240_331740
*PAR0:	I can just see you the room because I'm trying to get her to explore . 333580_380320
*PAR0:	&-um she doesn't she like goes to the bookshelf . 381020_383660
*PAR0:	and like she'll eat my books . 383660_385100
*PAR0:	&-um and then like she crawls up under the night the [/] the [/] the coffee table . 385920_392440
*PAR0:	like she likes to get in there and like push stuff out of the way . 392780_395720
*PAR0:	&-um and so this is kinda different like cause I don't really put everything in one space . 396760_402980
*PAR0:	for her <I felt> [/] I felt like it was overwhelming like to so many different things . 402980_407140
*PAR0:	because I probably put like four or five things down the floor in different parts that she has to find on her own . 407140_414220
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah no you're right . 414220_419760
*PAR0:	that's what I was thinking . 419760_421000
*PAR0:	I like . 421000_421200
*PAR0:	oh I should get more like these sort of things . 421200_425700
*PAR0:	yeah . 425700_425840
*PAR0:	stackable things . 425840_428780
*PAR0:	you got it . 428780_438500
*PAR0:	you got the green book . 438500_446540
*PAR0:	okay . 446540_449360
*PAR0:	alright . 449360_450120
*PAR0:	that was pretty . 450120_450560
