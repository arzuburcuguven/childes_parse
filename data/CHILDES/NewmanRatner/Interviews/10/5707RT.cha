*PAR0:	&-um do you think I can ask you a few questions . 600_2720
*PAR0:	sure . 2780_3040
*PAR0:	great . 3900_4340
*PAR0:	&-um again we're still gonna be recording . 4920_6540
*PAR0:	sure . 6620_6840
*PAR0:	so we'll have to write anything down so you can be as lanky as you'd like . 6860_11180
*PAR0:	okay . 11460_11580
*PAR0:	&-um so what do you think &-uh was different today than from other days . 12420_16980
*PAR0:	&-uh from the last visit . 16980_18060
*PAR0:	&-um well the last visit he wasn't as mobile . 18780_22560
*PAR0:	so he [/] he basically you know just grabbed what was in front of him but nothing was familiar . 22560_27540
*PAR0:	so &-um he didn't really play with it as much . 27920_30780
*PAR0:	and he didn't vocalize at all where &-um you know <he and I> [/] he and I played mostly through making noises not words just noises . 30820_42180
*PAR0:	so &-um I don't know he [/] he like he likes the noises . 42700_49120
*PAR0:	so you know he played with this book . 49220_50800
*PAR0:	he's banging them together first . 51080_52540
*PAR0:	so that's usually what he does at home too . 52680_54540
*PAR0:	he just starts banging . 54840_56400
*PAR0:	and then I don't know just roaming around being physical like he is . 57180_64000
*PAR0:	plus the &-uh the sounds usually makes him pretty happy . 64000_66780
*PAR0:	so right more than just the [/] the toys really make no difference at this point . 67240_72180
*PAR0:	&-uh huh it matter what he's playing with . 72260_73780
*PAR0:	if it makes a noise at some point you were &-um building right . 73960_78880
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 79280_81020
*PAR0:	&-um I at home we have these blocks <or you> [/] or you know those little shapes that you put into . 81020_86040
*PAR0:	&-um &-um it's like a fisher price thing where the shapes fit into an exact spot . 86040_92440
*PAR0:	and I don't know I just discovered this week that &-um whenever . 93260_97260
*PAR0:	I would start building them'd . 97260_98520
*PAR0:	take him down . 98520_99080
*PAR0:	anyway let's forget that <you were> [/] you were taking him down this week . 100040_105560
*PAR0:	well no he was when we were playing with him . 105720_109060
*PAR0:	&-um I'd build him up . 109060_110980
*PAR0:	and he'd take him down one by one . 110980_112500
*PAR0:	okay . 112580_112800
*PAR0:	so it was just kind of something that he seemed to like to do . 113120_116320
*PAR0:	mhm . 116620_116780
*PAR0:	so &-um I've been doing that with more things . 117080_119480
*PAR0:	just kind of building him up . 119720_120700
*PAR0:	okay . 121300_121440
*PAR0:	taking him down . 121440_122060
*PAR0:	did he &-um play with any of the animals today . 122940_126580
*PAR0:	nope no animals . 126820_128220
*PAR0:	he really has no interest in plush animals . 128280_130860
*PAR0:	no [/] no the texture probably the sound or the register . 131320_134780
*PAR0:	it's the sound . 135040_135860
*PAR0:	it's &-um he li he likes to feel things but he's not really interested in plush things right now . 136000_142920
*PAR0:	and it's mostly hard things and things that he can bang and [/] and put together . 143140_148220
*PAR0:	he does not put things in his mouth . 148720_150460
*PAR0:	oh that's good . 151220_152280
*PAR0:	it's &-um a [/] a little unusual . 152480_154500
*PAR0:	&-um but he [/] he just he doesn't play like that . 154980_157620
*PAR0:	hi hey Bud how about the food . 158040_162700
*PAR0:	I've seen him in Alice popular just by the title . 162980_166220
*PAR0:	yeah I don't know . 166800_168460
*PAR0:	&-um I don't think he recognizes them as food . 168760_170900
*PAR0:	mm hm oh hi he . 171060_173100
*PAR0:	mm hm that's another court . 173380_174660
*PAR0:	yes it is &-um <it's more> [/] it's more the noises <and the> [/] and the feel of them . 174780_182260
*PAR0:	mm than the actual items . 182500_184800
*PAR0:	but he like around the house . 185400_186840
*PAR0:	he probably doesn't hear certain ones or . 186840_190800
*PAR0:	okay you know honestly we don't do &-uh . 192420_196540
*PAR0:	a whole lot of food stuff with him at all . 196540_198800
*PAR0:	he's not eating regular food yet . 199120_202480
*PAR0:	he won't he actually won't he only eats baby food . 202720_205540
*PAR0:	he refuses to eat anything . 205640_206820
*PAR0:	oh harder . 207160_208240
*PAR0:	he won't eat try finger food or anything like that as much as we try nothing . 208240_214460
*PAR0:	he eats looks like food &-uh huh . 214460_216480
*PAR0:	so &-uh and none of our toys are food . 216780_220180
*PAR0:	&-um so it might be the color . 221080_224660
*PAR0:	it might be the just the feel of [/] of the plastic hard that he can bang . 224800_230820
*PAR0:	no but I don't if he recognizes it I'm not sure where it would be from . 231260_237280
*PAR0:	okay . 237660_238340
*PAR0:	how about the &-um &-uh books the books . 239060_241880
*PAR0:	he usually likes books . 242160_243020
*PAR0:	he likes the feel of them more than anything else which is where he was going with that one more than . 243120_247580
*PAR0:	he doesn't usually sit have them to him . 247580_250600
*PAR0:	but &-um if we can like point out certain things and get the noises going . 250600_256980
*PAR0:	he'll play with it . 256980_259240
*PAR0:	excited . 259620_259820
*PAR0:	which book was that by the way was he that was the Mr Brown Camu oh okay . 259920_264360
*PAR0:	cameo . 264580_265000
*PAR0:	okay . 265440_265820
*PAR0:	yep . 266120_266360
*PAR0:	it's funny . 266780_267180
*PAR0:	he seemed to like that . 267180_268220
*PAR0:	and he seemed to like one sound over another . 268340_270900
*PAR0:	yes . 271080_271360
*PAR0:	didn't he [/] he does he has favorite sounds . 271480_273800
*PAR0:	well what are those sounds . 274200_275620
*PAR0:	what are they . 275700_276140
*PAR0:	&-um as he's grown let's see his first found sound that I discovered was Ble he just liked the word Ble and &-uh then it was . 276480_286140
*PAR0:	oh Achoo was a big one . 286140_288480
*PAR0:	achoo . 289320_289860
*PAR0:	achoo . 290780_292920
*PAR0:	I don't feel happy . 293500_294500
*PAR0:	yeah it does . 294820_295780
*PAR0:	and then for a little while it was Broccoli [/] Broccoli but then he had Broccoli and that one hasn't really worked as well . 296100_302700
*PAR0:	and what was it this week . 302980_306580
*PAR0:	there was a new one this week . 306660_307860
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know . 308720_315020
*PAR0:	I can't remember what a new one . 315020_315820
*PAR0:	but we'll add Moo [/] Moo to the list . 315820_317440
*PAR0:	right . 317620_317840
*PAR0:	Moo moo [/] moo [/] moo yeah he [/] he just has sounds that have always just made him light up . 318080_326220
*PAR0:	yeah . 326500_326980
*PAR0:	&-um so usually if I can just &-uh mimic his sounds until I get to something close then there will be something that makes him smile . 326980_338780
*PAR0:	and that makes me latch onto it . 338940_341820
*PAR0:	yeah and do it more of course . 341920_343700
*PAR0:	and it's something that laughing made me laugh . 343960_345760
*PAR0:	I was you know I was doing something else . 345880_347580
*PAR0:	and I just it was funny . 347580_349680
*PAR0:	yeah . 349900_350120
*PAR0:	the &-uh we have videos of him . 350120_351780
*PAR0:	when he flashes on to these words it just makes him happy . 351780_355260
*PAR0:	the achoo is the biggest one . 355580_356920
*PAR0:	it's lasted the longest . 357260_358460
*PAR0:	achoo . 358560_358920
*PAR0:	achoo . 360540_361060
*PAR0:	and he doesn't normally mimic back mean we we'll get back and forth with da [/] da and bow [/] bow . 362380_370300
*PAR0:	mm hm it's I don't know . 370720_373020
*PAR0:	just kind of a we have music going a lot at home . 373020_376920
*PAR0:	I guess . 376920_377340
*PAR0:	so maybe that's part of it . 377420_378900
*PAR0:	I was gonna ask other activities . 379340_381120
*PAR0:	&-um I sometimes say like Patty cake . 381580_384560
*PAR0:	there's other activities you could do or even you know counting sometimes you could do like singing and counting . 384800_390180
*PAR0:	I sing constantly at home . 390640_392240
*PAR0:	I [/] I don't know why I never sing . 392300_394940
*PAR0:	I have a horrible singing voice . 395020_395920
*PAR0:	but at home with him . 396420_397940
*PAR0:	&-um it calms him down . 397940_399300
*PAR0:	so like when I'm changing him on a in the morning he's like wanting to go . 399640_403840
*PAR0:	and he starts singing . 403840_404640
*PAR0:	he'll at least relax a little bit . 404640_406320
*PAR0:	and I just think but this is another one . 406320_408660
*PAR0:	it again it [/] it it's [/] it's all with noises with him . 409440_412180

*PAR0:	show her again . 420580_425540
*PAR0:	sorry . 425540_427120
*PAR0:	I only do it when he puts my hands together to make the noise . 427120_431980
*PAR0:	it's not me pulling it . 431980_434860
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah he just likes the noise . 434860_441000
*PAR0:	he's actually really funny . 441880_443120
*PAR0:	but he won't play Patty cake himself . 443660_445920
*PAR0:	like when I try and do it with his hands he [/] he pulls back and [/] and won't have anything to do . 446040_450400
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 450400_450900
*PAR0:	so he won't do Patty cakes . 451180_452640
*PAR0:	he likes Eatsy Weetsy Spider right Eatsy Weets't do any of the motions or anything . 453660_466260
*PAR0:	&-um and we [/] we keep trying so big . 466580_470300
*PAR0:	&-uh and he gets a kick out of it . 470700_473260
*PAR0:	but he won't actually you know put his arms up around . 473560_476780
*PAR0:	yeah . 477400_477760

*PAR0:	but [/] but was . 508640_508980
*PAR0:	there anything else that you noticed that maybe was comparable or contrastable I guess different from how you guys played today . 508980_516120
*PAR0:	&-um I was trying to think of the kinds of . 516120_521060
*PAR0:	honestly we don't have many of these toys out . 521820_524480
*PAR0:	we have &-um like the &-um one of those Jimmy Mats ours has a little noise thing on it that <you can> [/] you can push on and make noises . 525700_539260
*PAR0:	&-uh we don't have a top on it . 539440_541200
*PAR0:	but &-um that every everything we have kinda has is noise related . 541300_545200
*PAR0:	mhm . 545520_545740
*PAR0:	&-uh I don't like . 546180_547000
*PAR0:	that's what he likes . 547000_547940

*PAR0:	mhm . 554340_554460
*PAR0:	the feel of blocks . 555600_556300

*PAR0:	we don't have any of his toys out . 561200_563960
*PAR0:	okay . 563960_564380
*PAR0:	&-um so <they're all> [/] they're all gonna be new to him . 564380_566900
*PAR0:	&-uh we do let him play with some books . 567820_569220
*PAR0:	&-um so he [/] he he's familiar with those but none of the same titles . 570060_574780
*PAR0:	nope . 575280_577880
*PAR0:	nope . 578180_579860

*PAR0:	mhm . 589240_589400
*PAR0:	relaxation kind of thing . 589520_591580

*PAR0:	&-uh he'll [/] he'll sit for a couple of pages . 596240_599460

*PAR0:	mhm . 601640_601840
*PAR0:	itself . 601960_602280

*PAR0:	so anything that's kind of lyrical . 613640_617160
*PAR0:	you have a little bit more attention span for it than an actual story . 617160_623360
*PAR0:	but this is usually what it is [/] is playing with mom and dad or the . 623360_629180
