*PAR0:	I mean she went right for the food this time . 16840_18920
*PAR0:	and that I do remember being different . 18920_21360
*PAR0:	I mean she played a little bit with it . 21360_22600
*PAR0:	yeah you've got the measuring spoons . 22600_25700
*PAR0:	she was very interested the last time in the little Yellow Bee guy . 25700_29140
*PAR0:	and this time you know she was interested . 29140_31340
*PAR0:	but she didn't go for it like . 31340_32820
*PAR0:	yeah you like that huh . 32820_37920
*PAR0:	yeah . 37920_39080
*PAR0:	and she was a little more interested in the books this time I was [/] was I was surprised last time she didn't go for them because she loves them at home . 39080_44440
*PAR0:	and this time she was when I gave her the one she was opening em &-uh opening it up and looking at it . 44480_49040
*PAR0:	and [/] and that's more typical for that's more typical . 49040_51000
*PAR0:	yeah yes I got a spoon . 51360_53100
*PAR0:	and she's doing that . 53520_54340
*PAR0:	she wasn't doing that before she'll hand you things and take them away . 54500_56880
*PAR0:	and thank you thank [/] thank you [/] you . 56880_60180
*PAR0:	I see . 60180_60780
*PAR0:	do you think that she's interested in these food items or the kitchen things . 60780_68940
*PAR0:	&-um for any particular reason . 68940_71360
*PAR0:	&-um she may be a little hungry . 71360_73740
*PAR0:	and she thinks it looks like food . 73740_75320
*PAR0:	so she's trying to and that confirms it because that na [/] na [/] na . 75320_79520
*PAR0:	yep . 79780_80040
*PAR0:	she's trying ta tell me that she wants ta eat something because we you can go ahead and give it to her . 80100_85420
*PAR0:	yeah because I see so . 86020_87120
*PAR0:	that's her word sort of for . 87120_88580
*PAR0:	mhm . 88580_88780
*PAR0:	she I think she uses it to a p .
*PAR0:	she's been smacking her lips a little bit too . 89340_93160
*PAR0:	and that does mean she's hungry like the na [/] na because I'm still nursing . 93560_96080
*PAR0:	she applies that to nursing . 96400_97760
*PAR0:	and [/] and then [/] then the sound [/] sound . 97760_99360
*PAR0:	so I think that was part of why &-um that also . 99360_102940
*PAR0:	but she [/] she realizes what they are . 102940_104760
*PAR0:	and she's trying to hold them up to me probably saying . 104760_107000
*PAR0:	yeah . 107000_107380
*PAR0:	do you want peas . 107380_108100
*PAR0:	I don't have any peas with me . 108100_109720
*PAR0:	but you like peas . 109720_110480
*PAR0:	okay . 111000_111160
*PAR0:	so you think she would recognize that for instance would . 111160_113140
*PAR0:	mhm . 113420_113540
*PAR0:	okay . 113800_114160
*PAR0:	any of the other food items . 114160_115440
*PAR0:	yeah . 115540_115880
*PAR0:	definitely the spaghetti &-uh the pizza not so much but the bread pieces . 115880_120820
*PAR0:	&-um she's seen these before . 120820_122400
*PAR0:	you know she's seen ice cream cones before . 122400_123900
*PAR0:	and we might have tasted em . 123900_125740
*PAR0:	I mean she she's never had pizza . 125820_127180
*PAR0:	but she's seen us eat it before . 127180_129340
*PAR0:	and &-uh she you know she liked the hamburger . 129840_133380
*PAR0:	she has had those . 133520_134440
*PAR0:	and when I asked her if she wanted the hamburger she pointed at it . 134660_137520
*PAR0:	so because she was pointing over . 137520_139760
*PAR0:	yeah I got your peas interesting Exc when [/] when she pointed over here I was said by I handed her I [/] I think it was a plate . 139760_146460
*PAR0:	and she said . 146620_146900
*PAR0:	I said . 146900_147080
*PAR0:	do you want the hamburger . 147080_147820
*PAR0:	and she took one of that . 148000_149280
*PAR0:	so she may recognize a lot of these . 151080_153480
*PAR0:	then . 153480_153780
*PAR0:	yeah . 154000_154980
*PAR0:	do you think she is recognizing the way it looks . 154980_158580
*PAR0:	or does she do you think she would recognize the words for some of these . 158580_161840
*PAR0:	I think she'd probably recognize the word cause . 161840_165320
*PAR0:	like if I yeah [/] yeah . 165320_167760
*PAR0:	do <you want> [/] you want to eat peas . 167760_171240
*PAR0:	you want to eat peas and smack your huh . 171240_175160
*PAR0:	oh you got your pinky in . 175160_176580
*PAR0:	yeah . 176580_177320
*PAR0:	you want to eat your peas maybe . 177320_180300
*PAR0:	yeah . 180300_180780
*PAR0:	want to eat peas . 180780_182640
*PAR0:	no you're not going to eat you want ice cream . 182640_186220
*PAR0:	yeah you do know what that is . 186220_188460
*PAR0:	don't you . 188460_189300
*PAR0:	so I think she does just based on the reaction . 189300_193040
*PAR0:	like if we say Cauliflower at home . 193040_194760
*PAR0:	she gets all excited . 194760_195520
*PAR0:	that's her favorite food . 195640_196340
*PAR0:	and we figured it out because of the reaction that she has to the Cauliflower and then she eats it . 196780_201240
*PAR0:	and she eats it . 201440_201860
*PAR0:	no she loves it . 201900_202380
*PAR0:	in . 202420_202480
*PAR0:	fact if I give her my she likes mashed potatoes . 202480_204080
*PAR0:	but she thinks they look of course the same . 204080_206120
*PAR0:	and then she'll taste it . 206540_207200
*PAR0:	and I asked did you see the ducky . 224080_226120
*PAR0:	and she pointed to the duck . 226120_227280
*PAR0:	so I think she knows what that means . 227280_229600
*PAR0:	I know if there was like a stuffed cat was looking for a cat or a dog . 229600_232680
*PAR0:	because like in the waiting room she you know when she pulled the dog down I said doggy . 233000_236760
*PAR0:	and then she was like . 237080_237760
*PAR0:	oh and she got all excited because she li she likes dogs and cats . 237760_240900
*PAR0:	I don't even think we have a cat . 241380_242880
*PAR0:	but I think we've got a pink poodle over there . 242940_245060
*PAR0:	oh that doesn't look much like a dog . 245140_246160
*PAR0:	oh just a thing . 246340_247280
*PAR0:	let's see . 247360_247940

*PAR0:	is that a doggy . 254360_255260
*PAR0:	is that the doggy that might have been a little . 255260_260000
*PAR0:	leading but I'm not sure . 260000_261460
*PAR0:	she looked at me like . 261460_262540
*PAR0:	where's the doggy . 262540_263420
*PAR0:	&-um not particular aside from the yellow guy . 263420_269240
*PAR0:	not particularly like I was we play with the chicken a little bit because she's seen those . 269240_274520
*PAR0:	and [/] and this guy I mean she liked him when it was more of a surprise . 274520_277680
*PAR0:	like the Peekaboo you is that a cookie . 277680_282420
*PAR0:	there you go . 282420_283540
*PAR0:	so when you brought it up and showed her like the &-um whatever animal that is with the hat . 283540_289040
*PAR0:	yeah like the [/] the [/] the groundhog the other one . 289680_291640
*PAR0:	m right then she'd interrupt but she didn't go get him . 292140_294060
*PAR0:	okay . 294160_294400
*PAR0:	yeah huh . 294720_295240

*PAR0:	oh [/] oh no [/] no sweetie you can't have that . 300040_302000
*PAR0:	she &-um she didn't go for the baby doll . 302300_304880
*PAR0:	but when I saw her pick up the bottle I [/] I said . 304900_307420
*PAR0:	do you wanna I said . 307420_308080
*PAR0:	do want to feed the baby . 308080_308920
*PAR0:	and so I set the baby on her lap . 308920_310520
*PAR0:	and she went to try to give the baby the bottle . 310520_312800
*PAR0:	and she tapped it on the head . 312800_314120
*PAR0:	but [/] but she did she went to give her baby the . 314120_316880

*PAR0:	was she ever interested in the baby doll . 323120_324920
*PAR0:	previous . 324920_325280
*PAR0:	no [/] no she had never been interested in the baby doll before . 325280_328200
*PAR0:	and she's not really interested in at home . 328200_330520
*PAR0:	she has one at home . 330520_331620
*PAR0:	okay . 331780_332020
*PAR0:	and she'll carry it sometimes but not any more than any of her other stuffed animals . 332140_335620
*PAR0:	okay . 336020_336280
*PAR0:	so it's about the same . 336280_337200
*PAR0:	so she's somewhat she has some of these items at home . 337320_340280
*PAR0:	and she . 340280_340660
*PAR0:	mhm . 340660_340800
*PAR0:	and . 341080_341840
*PAR0:	they're sort of eh right . 341840_343000
*PAR0:	yeah . 343200_343520
*PAR0:	she &-um the [/] the stuffed animals at home . 343520_344920
*PAR0:	she seems to like . 344920_345660
*PAR0:	and I thought it was interesting with the bee . 345660_347100
*PAR0:	the last time is . 347300_348360
*PAR0:	yeah you tend she tends to like things that are yellow like she has a big bird that she likes and a yellow triceratops and that [/] that . 348540_358200
*PAR0:	do you have any of these play &-um kitchen items at . 358480_362220
*PAR0:	no . 362220_362700
*PAR0:	mm . 362900_362980
*PAR0:	how about a day care in her room . 362980_365800
*PAR0:	I'm not sure . 365800_366820
*PAR0:	I know in her room . 367080_367820
*PAR0:	they have the stuffed animals and books and things . 367820_370240
*PAR0:	keys . 370560_371360
*PAR0:	they do have keys . 371580_372220
*PAR0:	but they don't have the food . 372320_373260
*PAR0:	<they've got the> [/] they've got the plastic food upstairs in the older kids room . 373320_376100
*PAR0:	so no idea this that she's seen has been either my husband and I eating it or [/] or feeding her things . 376780_381820
*PAR0:	be biting the bee again . 383220_387100
*PAR0:	&-um probably I'm thinking probably the stuffed animals . 387100_400360
*PAR0:	but I'm not sure because I know she doesn't because she does like the stuffed animals . 400360_406820
*PAR0:	but she doesn't seem to gravitate toward those as much as the other thing she was doing with these . 406820_410440
*PAR0:	and she does this at home with her blocks . 410440_411820
*PAR0:	and she bangs them together and makes noises and things . 411820_414680
*PAR0:	and then we have like I said some of the books because she always gets read to at night . 414680_419460
*PAR0:	she'll bring the book over . 419460_420400
*PAR0:	and we'll take it . 420400_420980
*PAR0:	we'll [/] we'll play the you know the back and forth game or [/] or she'll &-uh she'll wanna you know pretend she's reading them or she'll hand them to you . 421100_427840
*PAR0:	and then I'll [/] I'll go to open it . 427900_429180
*PAR0:	and she'll take it back . 429180_429960
*PAR0:	so I think least is probably the stuffed animal . 430660_433100
*PAR0:	she'll play with them a little bit but not you know she might cuddle one or she might you know look like she's talking to it . 433180_439080
*PAR0:	and then she know be done . 439140_441100
*PAR0:	it's not as interactive right . 441100_442280
*PAR0:	mhm . 442540_442720
*PAR0:	yeah . 442920_443400
*PAR0:	whereas yeah these make noise or the book she can turn . 443400_445840
*PAR0:	and except for that beat . 445840_448680
*PAR0:	yeah except for that beat . 448860_449560
*PAR0:	yeah . 449560_449900
*PAR0:	except like that beat that unusual . 450320_451540
*PAR0:	mhm . 452000_452320
*PAR0:	unusual beat . 452500_453200
*PAR0:	&-um alright . 453880_454620
*PAR0:	is there anything you know of that . 454620_456120
*PAR0:	she really loves at home or at day care that we don't have here . 456120_459860
*PAR0:	&-um she does have a lot of like rattle toys . 459860_465220
*PAR0:	and then she's got one of these Fisher Price &-um and also &-um a Sesame Street one where you push different buttons . 465220_472640
*PAR0:	and they make noises or they doors open . 472640_475340
*PAR0:	and she's figured out recently how to close the or open the door and push the buttons . 475600_480680
*PAR0:	and she recognizes different like the Sesame street toy has . 480680_486160
*PAR0:	it's like a cookie monster Elmo Ernie and Oscar and they open and I'll say different things . 486160_494260
*PAR0:	well if we happen to be watching Sesame Street or she sees them she'll point . 494260_498240
*PAR0:	and she knows like the Elmo's world song . 498240_501900
*PAR0:	or she knows the cookie monster and things like that . 501900_505960
*PAR0:	so it's more like the ones that make noise . 505960_508460
*PAR0:	and she likes the ones . 508460_509300
*PAR0:	it'll talk to her like she'll sit there . 509300_510620
*PAR0:	and she'll push it . 510620_511280
*PAR0:	and she'll and she's like she figured out how to close the door on one of them . 511280_514840
*PAR0:	so she'll go back and forth . 514840_516540
*PAR0:	and she'll talk back to it sometimes which is funny . 516540_519340
*PAR0:	so she does seem to like things that . 519340_520820
*PAR0:	make noise . 520820_521880
*PAR0:	she does like music . 521880_523860
*PAR0:	&-uh they play a lot of music at the daycare . 523860_525640
*PAR0:	yes you're okay . 525640_528640
*PAR0:	we're not ignoring you . 528640_530640
*PAR0:	we're really about done . 530640_531720
*PAR0:	I [/] I can't think of anything else . 531720_532980
*PAR0:	I need to ask the book . 532980_534200
*PAR0:	is that for me . 534200_535140
*PAR0:	would you like to read the book . 535140_536960

*PAR0:	she does she takes a thing . 547660_550460
