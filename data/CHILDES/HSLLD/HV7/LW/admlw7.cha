@Comment:	MOT and Chi worked together on this task , with no help from EXP. EXP did not talk at all , and Chi talked very little. Mot did most of the talking. Chi first asked Mot what to write , and Mot prompted Chi to come up with his own ideas. At one point , MOT suggested one sentence , which he used. Later she suggested he ask about the author's sister , which he did. Mot also helped with punctuation and capitalization. Otherwise , Chi worked very independently. Mot was very supportive , patient , and encouraging.
