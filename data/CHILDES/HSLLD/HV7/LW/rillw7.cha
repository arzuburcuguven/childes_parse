*MOT:	xxx letter to him ?
@Comment:	Time is 0:04
@Comment:	MOT starts out by asking if they can go over the book first and then write the letter. After they go over the book , MOT asks Chi what she would like to write. Chi gives an answer , but Mot seems to disregard it. Mot suggests something else and then tells Chi what to write for the rest of the letter. There seems to be a friendly atmosphere. Chi sighs heavily a few times when Mot corrects her writing. Chi seems to have some difficulty with spelling.
