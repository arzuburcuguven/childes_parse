can i ask you some questions
about what you guys played with
-um we played with
aha bch
we played with
the ice cream
the peas
the waffles
the pooh bear
then i brought out this but he wasnt that into this
and i brought out this one and he seemed more into that one
we read this book
the foot book
why do you think he was more into one versus the other
i think the colors
probably more
and then the purple
than just this white and black
he also seem interested in the eyes
on this one
for whatever reason
but i think maybe the contrast on here
was a little bit more interesting to him
than the black and white one
is he more familiar with the one word
meaning has he heard it more than the other
-um i doubt it to be honest with you
because i dont think we really have said bee more than zebra
or vice versa
im thinking it mightve been the color contrast
or whatever
and then
i think he was
oh im sorry bch
im sorry bch
baby bch
youre okay bch
and then i think he was interested in how this felt
the waffles in particular
because he kind of focused on this one

oh okay
im gonna talk to mommy
you can keep playing
you can play with devon if you want okay
keep going
are you gonna play babies
do you remember what macy played with last time
i think it was the plates
i think so
-uh did you notice any difference have you noticed even at home any differences with how she plays with things at home
not really
she -um
i dont know
shes usually
like this like shell get tired of a toy like
within five seconds and go on to the next
is so is she still into toys rather than more so than books
no i have some books that i put in front of her that she likes
theyre like the huge
books that have like million and one different like pictures of things and
but she likes those books and then of course the ones that make noise
so but
and then
she has a good night moon book
its not this one this ones the counting book but like
the regular good night moon book that she likes
-um have how about so today she played with well what do you think was her like favorite thing
all this food stuff
like -um
a couple times she would grab the stuffed animals or i would try to
introduce the stuffed animals or the book and
and do you think she recognized the names of any like any of the foods familiar
-um probably pizza
because and as soon as she seen the pizza and picked it up she tried to eat it
because she had pizza a few nights ago
i think she recognized and was like hey
but -um
other than that
she eats peas but we dont really specifiy that shes eating peas at the moment
anything else
other than the bottle
i dont even know if i had said bottle but
that would be the other really other thing she i think would understand what it was
-uh how about like the sundaes or the co the icecream cone
she might recognize icecream
because she gets icecream at home
or like when were out but
i dont think we have it often enough for her to
kinda put two and two together
but thats a big treat though for her to get that
do you have any -um similar toys at home
-um we dont have any of the food which i should probably get
sh she has she has a bunch of stuffed animals but she really doesnt like to play with them at home either
i would say probably the only thing that i know she has is the keys
and she has a babydoll at home too but shes not really into the playing with babydolls stage yet i guess
did she
kind of like i -um
put it next to her and she kinda looked at it like
whats going on but
but -um
and then like a couple seconds later she went back to it and was like pulling it towards here and
like messing with its hand
youre crawling all over the food
its slippery huh
having fun
you having fun
-um so you said you have the animals at home
does she know them like by name or is she familiar with the name at least
probably the only
that she would know the name of other than dogs because have dogs or puppy
like she knows the names of those
and -um
the only other one that like stuffed animal wise i think she would recognize is a bunny
because she has a bunny that she plays with constantly at home
not plays with she usually sleeps with it
but say i cant go to bed without my bunny
do you think shes -um shes at home more interested in some categories
-um stuffed animals dolls food books like that
at home
she probably likes more hard plastic toys the best
-um like shell look through books and like shes reading
but -um and then the stuffed animals but she doesnt
play with them like shell play with them for a few minutes but shell always go back to that hard plastic
is she eating soups at home or anything like brothy
not yet weve just started introducing a lot of foods so
but like a couple weeks ago she had pizza and shes had
shes had -uh
a lot of stuff actually i dont think though
ive ever given her
soup or anything like that
-um i was just bringing it up because i saw the
oh yeah
so i was just thinking
trying to formulate it in some way
-uh so the food was a big success today and what do you think was the thing she went for the least
probably the books
because every time and especially this book
because i remember her kind of
messing with it last ni either last time or the time before because of the little patches of hair but
all of the books like i would put in front of her and shed be like eh
shes like theres food here
how is she playing with the food what do you think she likes about the food
i dont know
like a couple of times she would bang it together and then
like with the peas
she had like they when we got here they were on a plate like this
and she picked them up played with them for a little bit tried to put them back on the plate
and when that didnt work she tried to put it on the other side
but -um
and then
other than that she
youre losing all sorts of traction
other than that i think she was just kinda holding them checking them out and
banging them a little
and throwing them
that toy i handed it to her and she was like threw it over her shoulder i was like oh
maybe cookie
-uh i mean she has like the little bitter biscuits that like melt in their mouth and we call them her cookies
so -um she might recognize it but she doesnt get them often because theyre so messy so
other than that
i dont think she really
would recognize them or the name of them
no we dont eat a lot of bread type stuff in our house so
i dont think shes ever tried pancakes or waffles or bread or anything
okay well thats it for the line of questioning today
lets stop there
she kept looking up at you guys like why wont you play with me and smile
oh really
mean sitting in the corner
lets see
so which group of toys did she seem interested in
-um i think definitely the play food was her favorite
play food
did she like any specific ones
-um she liked the pizza
-uh liked the pizza a lot
the pasta
-um the peas
the plate
you gonna say hi bch
-um she liked the -uh the pitcher and the spoon
she played with that a lot
and the -uh carrot soup she liked
would she recognize any of these do you think
-um yeah she recognized i think the peas because we weve had peas the past couple nights
-um pizza she i dont know if she would necessarily recognize the shape per say because we cut it up but you know ive said you know shes had pizza before ive cut up
-um and bread
you know she knows her bread and we just had pasta for the first time too this week so i think she
yeah bch
okay -um
so why would you say she likes this group
-um i mean she did play with the frog too she liked the frog
and the eagle she played with
-um i think its because we really dont have any play food at home so its something new different
we -uh we asked for some for your birthday right bch
-um but i think that that was the main reason
-um because she has plenty of books at home and loves her books at home
you know shell take them all off her shelf and flip through them and
-um and she has some stuffed animals but theyre really you know she could take them or leave them
-um do you have any of the books we have
-um we have goodnight moon but not in the board book
we have the foot book and mister brown
-um and we have a karen katz book but not the baby peekaboo
-uh lets see
so which would you say she was least interested in
the books or
-uh yeah i guess the books
i tried to read her peekaboo and she was like
-um do you think therere any other items shed recognize the name of
-um definitely cheese
-um she loves cheese so she would recognize the cheese the pizza the peas the bread
oh icecream bch
you havent had icecream bch
one day youll know what that is bch
got the keys bch
we have keys at home bch
hi bch
aw bch
-um oh what about the animals would she recognize names of or
-um she recognized some of them -um
-um you know we talked about frogs and she has some books about frogs or that have frogs in them
-um you know the bumblebee she would recognize the name
-um and you said you have
oh you answered that question
would you say she prefers toys or books now
at home
at home i mean its its pretty much a fifty split
-um when we play in the living room we have all of her toys and she has some books there but when were in her room she has a lot more books and you know shell take all the books of her shelf and
so its pretty split
you know it depends on where we are and what shes in the mood for but -um
oh you got it bch
you know how to eat it bch
you know how to eat it bch
-um oh what about the doll
did she
didnt even go near it
does she have any dolls at home
-um not like that no
she has like a -um a more of a stuffed doll -um
oh yeah
that you know but she doesnt have like a real babydoll
-um okay i think thats it
unless is there anything you wanna tell us like does she have a favorite toy at home or anything
ball maybe bch
-um she has a couple of balls she does like to to chase those around and watch them roll
-um -um -um like she loves her cups you know like the stacking cups and -um the rings
you know shes shes putting on the rings and things
yeah bch
she really liked the pitcher
and the spoon
oh yeah
okay i think were all set then
you did a good job bch
say thank you bch
we can turn everything off
oh did she get her prize already
yes we did
she got a book
have you noticed
this visit that he was -um
that he have different interests
in different toys or
some kinds
-um he seemed to
he seemed
have a maybe longer attention span
with a few of them
hes getting
to eat more
like finger food table food
kind of stuff so
i thought he was
most interested in the food youd say
i think so
okay -um
do you think hed recognize
any of the foods we have here
any of the names of them
the peas hes had
fairly frequently
so that might be when
he recognizes
maybe from last time
i cant remember what
food we played with last time
but i know we played with some food
yeah its been a while
do you guys have play food at home
we do
so thats why okay
which would you say hes least
interested in
which -uh set
-uh -um
probably the stuffed animals i guess
we dont have many
because his older brother
doesnt like them
he seems to be a little bit interested
right you have a bird
alright and -um
do you
read books at home
do you have of the ones you have here
we have put me in the zoo and the foot book
and weve gotten this one from the library a few times
so would you say hes into toys
or books
-um mostly toys
books hes not so interested in
looking through them he wants to close them
youre two on them
what about
did he like the doll
at all
he didnt seem very interested
you have any of those at home
we have one
-um but its his brothers
so he doesnt
i do not know
he doesnt see it much
play with it
oh okay
do you think hed recognize any of the
the names of them
we just went to the
so we saw a bunch of
like farm animals i dont see any
farm animals
do you think he would know a dog
-um yeah he might
i dont know that
those look like any of the dogs ha
oh okay
i think thats it
plus is there anything you can think of
that he plays at home
we have a lot of cars
and trucks
and trains and all that
and he seems very interested in them
-uh huh
pushing them
okay i think
hes started to enjoy puzzles
taking the pieces out
trying to put them back
either while hes standing or sitting down
what hes able to do
you know
i think were all set then -um
did you guys get a prize
we did
wanna play with erica
come on
while i talk to mommy
-um has there been anything youve noticed has changed since the last time that you were here
-um i think the last time she really liked the doll and this time i dont think she could have cared less
about the doll
she was like really into the doll
she was holding her hand and everything
this time she didnt care
so which toys do you think she was most interested in this time
-um all the food
the food toys
maybe shes hungry
could be
i dont know
she was really into the food toys and she loves this gross thing
the hair is gross but i guess its cool it feels cool
-um which toys do you think she has the least interested in besides the doll
-um like just the little animals in general
she kinda just picked them up and threw them
and then
she got into the books at the end
so yeah i would say these stuffed animals
does she play with similar toys at home
yeah we have food toys
and -um i dont have little stuffed animals really
a couple but not many
but yeah we play with these similar ones at home
and any of the books
do you have any of these books at home
i dont have these same books but we have a lot of books
and she likes to look through them
which book do you think she was most interested today
she liked this one
the the peekaboo one
-um do you think there are any items here that she would recognize the name of
-um doggie
yeah she knows doggie and baby
the little baby but she didnt
say it
she usually calls her doll a baby
-um what about any of the food items
-um that she would recognize the name of yeah but she doesnt know how to say the word yet
mhm so you use the words at home
like if i say spaghetti shell look at the spaghetti
try to say it
-um do you think that she prefers books or toys in general
hm i think she likes both
i dont know which one she prefers
i guess toys
if i hadta pick one
kim did you say you have any dolls at home
we have a doll oops sorry
yeah we have a doll
a couple dolls
we have a baby doll and then like you know little animal dolls
is there anything that you think we should know about her play
-um nope
nothing special sorry
we ruined your
its okay
i think its fixable
yeah it is
look at this guy
this gross guy
hes got like hair
like real hair
its like stuck to the gummy hair
its gross
we tried to clean them off
yeah i know
i know
yeah thats it
i think similar to last time shes just really into the pizza
i guess the pizzas pretty
its got a lot of colors
okay -um the only the question i have for you is we wont see her again until she is around two
-um would you like called for other studies in between
sure mhm
i dont know of i can come to all of them but
of course yeah
you have the option anytime to decline and we keep you on the list
so -um youll call me when she is ready to come back for the
mhm either our lab or there are three other labs on campus
so it could be any of those labs too
is that the last one
or is that just one of the series
of tests in this one
this study is only four well call you when shes at two
oh thats the last one
okay and then -um but we
thats awhile
but we have studies here for all ages
-um and the other labs as well
yeah it was kinda fun
so what was he most interested in
standing up
the peas of course
every time the peas have been his favorite
its the food that he recognizes the most
he likes peas a lot
but i think theyre also very chewy
the texture to chew them and such
the waffles
he likes the waffles
not for very long though
was he interested in any other of the foods
-uh he looked at the pizza and the spaghetti
thats about it today
oh and this can thing
what is that
what have you got
did you show
he just likes the way he can hold it and drop it
that one he doesnt really chew it
he just holds it and drops it
did you show him any of the animals
i did
i showed him the bee and the sheep and the kangaroo
but mostly he just liked that this had eyes that he could bite
we dont have to be at home right now so he doesnt know what they are
but they do
so what was the game you were playing with him with the
aha peas on the head
well first it was all fall down because he likes to drop things
and so like before we were we -um
like he likes to do it in the bathtub and stuff like that
like he just picks something up and drops it
over something or around something
and so were just calling it all fall down
and then he started falling down
and then i was putting peas on our heads and they were falling down
and peas in the mouth and it fell down too
was there anything he was interested last time that he didnt go for this time
he did more of the food last time
this time he was more happy standing up
and he usually goes and pulls her hair for a little bit but he didnt do that this time
oh heres the ice cream cone
thats the only thing baby dolls are good for him
you can pull their hair without them getting mad at you huh bch
he likes to pull hair
and bite
so do you guys have a lot of these toys at home or
-um we have some spoons and plates and not really many food toys like that
so we have the bottle
-um lots of stuffed animals but
he doesnt play with those as much lots of little stuff animals
my daughter plays with those more than him
and we have a babydoll like that
we have a couple babydolls for my daughter but
does he like it when you read to him
we usually do one book for him and the rest he just sits through his siblings books
he just listens to their books too
what kinda books do you read to him
oh he likes the touch and feel ones a lot
and ones with baby pictures
and we have some little ones that are little tiny ones that he likes to carry around
but he mostly listens pretty well to theirs actually
just because hes got the lap and he likes to keep his throne
are you a good listener
its good to be a good listener
well we are done with this part
you see
you can play
i think ill talk to your mom
talk to your mom
yeah thats her
thats right thats your mom
well -um i dont know how long ago it was that you came for the second visit but
it was like a month
okay so maybe there have been some changes i do not know
that you noticed with what he likes to play with or how hes playing with toys
im not going to write this down
just gonna capture it
i think -um hes starting to learn what things are a little bit more
so you know he mightve known that this kind of stuff is food i do not know
-um we dont have any toys like this at home
any of the food toys
so its different for him
i mean when were in the kitchen he plays with the spoons and the spatulas and
but -uh otherwise we dont have any of the play foods so thats sorta new to him
okay did he seem to like that a lot
yeah i mean i would point out the animals and he didnt even seem to care about those as much
you like the food and everything
did he have any favorite foods
he kept grabbing the -uh
the pizza and the hamburger he kept going for
he did
he really liked that pizza
but it doesnt look so much like a real thing do you think he
i dont know that he would know that its real pizza
i mean all hes ever had is a crust with pizza anyways
so hes never really seen it
for some reason he liked it
why do you think he liked those
hamburger and pizza
-um i do not know hes always liked things that are red in color
i do not know if that has anything to do with it thats a complete guess
-um because then this is sorta boring looking in comparison so
but he liked that
he liked it he was holding on to this like the whole time
wow okay
-um lets see
so would you say the food interested him the most of all the toys
definitely yeah
where you going alex
which things do you think interested him the least
you can go find your car
i think the books
he likes books at home but usually its when hes quiet
and were sitting
and napping
so for him that was just too slow
so he wasnt as interested
-um he definitely seemed to be interested in the baby
but then as soon as you brought it over he was you know
he thought it was neat
but -uh
he noticed it or something
he definitely noticed it
you noticed the baby interesting
but maybe doesnt know how to play with it
thats interesting
a lot of kids seem to be interested in the facial features of the baby
wheres the nose
wheres the nose
wheres the nose
how about any of these
he remembered this from last time
and thats completely because of the head
i think he loves this texture
so -um this he recognized and this he loved
mom says you like that
i think i heard animal names and sounds but i wasnt sure if they were these animals i
-um i mean i did a horse sound and a doggie sound
and then you know we did all the sounds in this
oh in that maybe that was what i was
those are farm ones
and so he knows all the farm animals he knows his rubber duckie at home
does he make the noises yet
but -uh when he takes his bath he knows his rubber duckies
and he has this little crab
and if i say wheres the crab he gives me the crab
so he knows what they are
so he knows what that means interesting okay
-uh huh and you pair the sound with the animal
so i do it often
so he would pick up on it
-um and i asked you about differences from last time
no over here
they all like that
ill have to get a different system for when they get older like you
hey what did i say no
you can play over here
oh that feels good
that feels really good
do you think overall he prefers toys or books at this point
-um at this point toys
okay alright
and do you know what -um qualities about toys you would say that attract him
you mentioned color
i think the texture is probably bigger than anything
-um because he likes to put things in his mouth
you know so he was holding the things that are softer
versus really hard
yeah he wasnt as much
i mean thats a guess
-uh he has lots of blocks at home so i was sorta doing blocks with that
youre smiling about that
and do you have any dolls at home
-um you know theyre all not baby dolls theyre animals
so theres like a big puppy big bear but actually no baby
so maybe that was its a little different from what hes useta
no we fed alex
he fed himself
so he liked drinking from this
except i think he was disappointed there was no water in it
and -uh he ate with a spoon
oh he did very nice
well sort of
he pretended right
-um so do you think he recognizes any of the object names for any of these yet
of whats here i think he might have recognized this
-uh when i called it do you want a drink do you want water
i dont use the term cup very often actually
so he definitely recognized that
-um he mightve recognized spoon
but im not sure
it seems like you played with a variety of things though
-um you got around to at least offering most of these kinds of toys
thats great
that is great
-um i think thats all i needta ask you at this point
-um unless theres anything you noticed that you thought was kind of interesting for us to know -um
-um i dont think so
i thought it was odd how he was sitting still the whole time at home he never sits still
hes always all over the place
yeah he was right in that frame the whole time
yeah i said oh you wanna see the bee and he just sort of stared
he didnt really go for it
okay well i think thats all i need
and then youre going to come back when hes two
big difference yeah
im just gonna ask you a few questions
i see the lights
he can play with the toys if he still wants while were
asking some questions
which of the toys
seem to interest cayden the most
well he played with this bee for a long time
and the baby
and the books a little bit
come get me
which ones do think interest him
the least
and why
he didnt seem that interested in
a lot of the stuff animals
he doesnt really seem interested in them at home either
so i do not know
why he not just
i know
he just doesnt
doesnt really capture his interest very much
yeah i know
and the food he didnt play with
and im surprised because
because we have a lot of
food type toys at home
i know youre hungry
okay hold on
so i wouldve thought that maybe hed play with those a little more
you know what
i know your hungry hold on ha
okay hold on
ill feed you in a minute haha
hold on
so do you think any of the items
that caydens been interested maybe have changed since
the last time you were here
last time he was all over -um
the waffles and the pizza
and i thought it was
i thought because it was similar to what we had at home
-um he seemed more willing to explore
more unfamiliar toys this time
i know your hungry
what would cayden probably prefer to look at with you
what kind of books do you think cayden would prefer
-um he likes to look at the kinda where the
the pages
flip open like
you know theyre folded over
and then they flip open
or they have little flaps that open
he really likes the
open and close ones
but he also liked that one with the texture
oh my goodness your nails are sharp
does cayden play with some more toys at home
pretty similar yeah
-um we dont have a lot of babies
but he has a sister so
sorta the same idea haha
he does like to -uh
get on her and give her kisses like that so
wow good job
yeah your big on pieces
books or toys
i think toys
but he seems a lot more interested
in -um
in books lately
just the last month or so
ive really seen him
kinda get interested in looking at books
more and all
even when hes playing independently now hell look at books where before he would always play with toys
i mean you said that you do have pretend food at home
does cayden play with the pretend food at home
yeah he does he loves it
do you think
he recognizes any of the foods from the last time
that he was here or maybe some of them from home
he might
we do have a little juice thing
like the one he was playing with like this one
so that one is exactly the same
so that ones really familiar
we dont have the bread but he does
eat sandwiches
so haha
ha that could be the connection
what are you doing putting that on top
cayden recognizes any of the names
of any of these
or other items or maybe hes beginning to
i feel that he is
beginning to get -um
sometimes ill say
do you see the
fishy or something and -um
he might not necessarily go get it but i kinda see his eyes going toward it
a few things
yeah more he recognizes people
than things
ouch that hurts when you pinch
are you hungry you wanna eat
ill let you go eat
ha wanna eat now or go eat in the car
hes a good boy he just got hungry
totally understandable
do you remember what -um he primarily played with last time you were here
i think he did more of the stuffed animals
and the baby
he always goes to the baby
do you think he remembers it in particular
-um he has one at home
so i dont know if he remembers this particular baby
but he does have a doll at home that he likes to play with so
are there other things here that are like what you have at home
-um he has some stuffed animals
but he doesnt really pay much attention to them
he has books at home -um that he likes to look through
and hell listen to a short story usually
the plates
-um did he play as much with the food items before
he didnt
i think he spent more time today with the food items than he did previously
do you think theres anything there that hed recognize
probably not because hes not a good eater
so he
no he could kinda match if i shh you know showed him
he did like to hold things that were the same
but i dont think he really knows what they are because hes not a good eater
so mostly looking for things for which there were pairs
yeah or were similar -um in shape i think
or you know like he would pick up the two spoons or
where you going
do you think there was anything else among those that made them particularly interesting
-um well the bottle because hes useta those
so he did that
-um and i think to put the cookie in here
he was trying to get it out
but i think it kinda frustrated him a little bit that he couldnt get it out
not yours
come here
come here
not yours
come here
you coming
you want that box huh
see the stickers
-um were there particular books -um that that you also have at home or that you think hed be familiar with
-um no
he doesnt have
he has the foot book at home
but he doesnt really
he is more interested in books with real -um babies in them
things like that
or -um pictures of real animals he seems to focus on more -uh than drawings
and all of those are yeah
that seems to be what hes doing now
have you noticed a change in the way he plays with toys at home
yeah -um its more purposeful now
you know hes putting things in -um taking things out
-um he has a stacked ring thing now that -um hell put the rings on
and also more frustration
like if he has -um a train that balls go in hell try to put blocks in it
if they dont go in it makes him angry
-um if he cant put stack things on the rings that makes him angry
-um so
yeah i think hes more purposeful
he loves balls
and hes starting to -um chase after them
and hell try to throw them a little bit
-um so i think its more purposeful kind of play
hes always been a pretty good player
he -um can keep himself occupied for pretty you know a pretty good amount of time with toys and things just on the floor
when you first started playing with the food items i know you pulled out particularly the can
he usually likes things to be stacked
and he does like to play with -um like real -uh soda cans and things like that or water bottles
hell go and pull them out and play with them
i dont know if its the so the water in them he likes to shake and kinda maneuver them
thats cheese
where you going
my goodness
come back here
oh you want that huh
thats okay
itll pull out completely actually
you gonna pull it out
i wouldnt trust it as sturdy enough to try using to stand on
but but its fine if he tries playing with it
you wanna take those out
you gotta pull hard
pull hard
you wanna put it back in
wanna push it in
wanna push it
there it goes
you got it
does he have a lot of toys at home that make noise
-um a lot of things that he can shake
balls and things like that
and also -um -um like puppies that will talk or make noise
that kinda
elecontronic electronic type things yeah
a few of those
remotes that you know you can push buttons and theyll make sounds
you gonna move it
what you trying to do
you want it out of the way
out of the way
get another one
youre gonna have to move back
i was worrying about that one
i thought you were gonna pull so hard you would fall back
you taking it out or putting it in
thats two
now there were some things that there were pairs of that you didnt play with
whats the matter
you dont want it there
he didnt go for the two slices of bread for example
no he didnt
do you think there was something about the ones he did go for
they were smaller maybe and easier for him to hold i guess
because it did seem to be like the peas and the
i dont know
where you going
i dont know
it didnt or maybe the color
i dont know if they were more colorful
what are you doing
what are you doing
yeah theres another one
gonna go get the other one
i was gonna say it almost seemed like he was going for the softer
yeah yeah
yeah it may be
these are definitely harder
yeah things he could squeeze a little bit
no not up there
yeah what do you want
thought you wanted that last bin
you dont want the last bin
get the last bin
where you going
you can get the bin from this side
youre busy
no you dont need those
i know
you say hi
whats that
is that your waffle
i think last time he did play a lot with that
he was interested in the the the holes
the indentations in it for some reason
does he have anything like that at home
i assume he doesnt eat real
no hes not a good eater
-uh as table foods go hell eat pieces of bread and cheerios but
not good with things like spaghetti
theres the bread
anything else you particularly noticed either about what he was playing with today or what he seemed interested in or what he does at home
what his favorites are
-um as far as toys here
he seemed to spend a lot more time with the foods than he did usually
-um you know the bottle and the cup i think because hes useta them at home he -um put those you know to him
-um going for those pens
you like pens too dont you
that can break
that can break
that can break
theres your baby
give the baby hugs
thats a bigger baby than your baby isnt it
he has a baby
hugs for the baby
headbutt the baby huh
babys ear
say hi baby
give baby kisses
hi baby
done with baby
you all finished with her
babys got shoes
babys got shoes
that babys got shoes
unlike you
thats another thing you like to play with though shoes
you like shoes dont you
no you dont have shoes do you
you just have feet
just your feet
you wrestling with the baby
well as you know this is the the third and last for a while
the next visit isnt until he turns two
so youve still got a ways until you come back for another one of these
-um at that point -um it will be basically a series of -uh language assessments and -um working memory tests and a whole bunch of things
-um as well as some social stuff
-um as well as some assessments of kind of again what kinds of things hes interested in social skills cognitive skills
how about going back over this way
come this way
keep moving
oh shoes
you got a can
well what do you think
should we go in the room and get you a toy for participating today
oh dont worry about them
are you sure
yeah because ill take them out to put other stuff in
oh thats where they store everything
yeah you were gonna take it out anyway huh
you gonna take it out anyway
thats a big bin huh
thats a big bin
wanna put them in
alright so what do you think his favorite toy was this time
besides the camera and the cord -um
i think the sippycup and the spoon were the two that he seemed to play with the most
why do you think so
i think hes hungry
hes ready for lunch
he hasnt had anything to drink in a little bit so hes probably just hungry and thirsty
do you think he recognizes those things
yes definitely
i bet a lot of it he probably doesnt recognize but the sippycup and the spoon and the bottle
i think he definitely does
and he loved the icecream cones last time and this time and so i dont know if he recognizes them or not or if he just likes to chew on them
you know what i mean like he likes the shape of them or whatever so
because we dont usually get this kind of cone
so yeah hes always gravitates towards plastic toys hes never been into the stuffed animals hell play with books at home
mostly to take them off the shelf and throw them but
the stuffed animals hes never interested in
maybe the pizza
and the cheese
im gonna say thats probably i dont know thats probably about it
so what did he like last time you said the icecream
the icecream cones
the icecream cones and the icecream sundae well and and you know what he might recognize those like thats been one of his favorite things lately is when we eat icecream he loves to have some
so i think yeah maybe he might recognize the icecream
and that doesnt really look like pasta so i dont know if hed recognize that
i agree
maybe the bread
weve started giving him bread lately
do you think he recognizes any of the stuffed animals
i dont think so i mean we read books and talk you know ill point out animals and stuff he doesnt seem to be real engaged
he likes to play with those little farm toys but he doesnt real like he doesnt seem real interested in stuffed animals and so its hard to tell
he likes when we make noises and stuff but then hes like kinda done with it
right so
and i think he likes to play with the eyes on the doll
which makes me nervous because my sisters getting ready to have a baby
and hell poke the baby in the eye
oh man
thats why i always try to treat dolls like real kids
hows that spoon
say it better food on it
yeah you are hungry
and hes still teething so he has no teeth yet so he chews on anything he can get in his mouth
and i think thats part of the reason he likes to play with the the hard toys compared to the soft toys
because hes never played with soft toys
oh that makes sense
gentle nathan remember
look gentle there you go good job
not in the eye though
youre a good listener
do you -um use a lot of words of encouragement when he does something right or
yeah i mean i try to i try to
unfortunately you know most of the time he ends up going for the outlet or the video camera or the cord or the you know so he spends a lot of time doing that so yeah we try to look out for that and do as much words of encouragement as we can
does he gravitate towards toys that make noise
he likes them -um but thats not like the only hell play with like
we you know and its funny because when i think about it i think all of our noise making toys are in one room and like all of his other toys you know what i mean and like not on purpose i think thats just how it worked out but
nathan no
and youre gonna try to cr crawl climb up that arent you
come here come see mama
im gonna get you
good boy
-um he does like he does like toys that make noise but
like theres some toys when we turn them off he enjoys them just as much when theyre not making noise so he likes to play with a lot of stuff that doesnt make noise too
so its probably half and half
so do you think he -um likes certain certain colors or textures
definitely like hard plastic better than like soft stuff
im trying to think if weve got like wood toys or anything like that
he definitely likes bumpy stuff -um if somethings got like a you know some kind of pattern texture on it he likes that
im trying to think of what else
yeah i think that thats probably the most of it and he likes he likes chewing on board books he likes chewing on paper he loves chewing on paper
thats always a challenge because he tries to choke on that too
but yeah i think mostly just the harder toys and then if theres like a bumpy some soft of bumpy texture on it he likes that
basically anything that feels good on his gums
is really wants to but hes started like he has a shape sorter at home
and he loves playing with that and he started putting shapes into the box and trying to put it through the right holes
he never quite gets them the right direction but like hell put the circle over the circle hole and
you know and so i think hes starting to get that like different shapes and stuff like that hes starting to learn that
and hes figured out he loves -um he has a little people barn and like theres certain doors that open and close that make noises and stuff and he loves hes figured out how to move all the things that makes noise and he likes to do that
thats really good
then he also likes to just carry the little people around with him and chew on them and whatever
yeah and hell like hell definitely put stuff in and take stuff out of buckets and hes got a train thats got like the balls that come out of the top and hell grab them and hell put them back in and
he the putting in and taking out has been his latest favorite thing to do
oh i wanted to ask if you remember what his favorite toy was on the first visit
the first visit he was just kinda playing with all of the food toys
and i think it was like i dont know if it was this one but it was like one of these like i think rectangular kind of things
maybe like this one because he was probably smaller then
but yeah it was just i think it was one of these little things i dont know
yeah i think it was just one of these
ooh you know actually you know what it was it was i think there was like a can of peas or maybe this
i think this like one of these things
oh good
so hes been consistent with the food
and i think now hes starting to recognize more of it too since hes eating more like real food
he definitely gets excited when we when we pull a cracker out like he recognizes the package of crackers
and hes like i was putting it in the diaper bag earlier and i thought he was gonna jump out of his skin and then hes like what youre not giving me one
thats funny
alright so thats all the questions i have
and then he doesnt come back until hes two or something right
keep playing
keep licking everything
the clock
do you need me to leave this on
that way i dont have to write anything down
-um so have you noticed any changes since the last time
that you were here in terms of his interest in the toys or
interest in toys
these toys
ah no hes pretty much was drawn to the exact same things
he has no interest in the stuffed animals
gavin look at all these toys over here
id rather play with the person
okay so hes drawn to the same things you said as last time
no interest in these
he starts usually with the books
then he usually winds up on these things
okay so he was somewhat interested in the books
i mean he picked up one
and then he threw it away
okay and that was about the same as last time
okay so you think he really both times preferred the -um food and dishes
and weve started at home now incorporating books into like his play times too
so he can just
like we did like the touch and feel books so
so i thought he might be more interested in them
but he picked up that one and then
i mean hes still interested in things he can stick in his mouth so
so would you say that could be a reason why he likes those other things
i think so
yeah okay
well and theres variety
and theres things to explore in them
-um different textures
-um things like that so
some of them make noise
they make noise
they move
they resemble things hes familiar with like the bottle
right i was gonna ask about that so
i mean hes never had pizza
hes never had spaghetti
and when he eats peas they dont look like this
and his waffles dont really look like this
theyre cut up but
so maybe the bottle is the most realistic looking thing
i mean because that he put in his mouth the appropriate way and
and i mean he recognized the spoons
spoons mean food to him so
particularly this spoon
this one was more like a shaky thing
but this one was more like a spoon to put in his mouth
so he likes doing that
and he did the right thing with it
okay so you recognize those things
right gavin
what he did different this time compared to last time he did a little bit more copying
which he had never really done before
like i shook that
and then he shook these
-um so hes done that a little bit more
was there any other kind of copying that he was doing today
i mean for the most part i was f following him
i was letting him lead but
and then that seemed to engage him
when you did that
i mean thats how i let him play at home
i let him kinda have free reign
i dont really direct his play yet
i mean
so go ahead
like ill stack blocks or something to get him interested in them
but i usually let him
just do what
j do what he wants to do
and at home if you did the same thing that you did here sort of -um copy what he does
is he noticing that more
engaged with that more
mhm absolutely
at home too
like -um if i shake a rattle hell shake one too
or hell come over and pick one up and shake it
often what he does if im shaking something hell come and take it outta my hand
and do what i was doing
and then ill pick up another one and do it with him
okay so its a back and forth kinda thing youre doing
i hear him talking
so would you say the same as last time that these were the toys that interested him the least today
same as last time
because hell just eat that paper
it should be able to come with you if you wanna move around with it
hes a paper loving guy huh
here you wanna book
he can play with this now right
like with that car that he got last time
after he saw me move it back and forth then he would start to move it back and forth too
gavin look
oh its this way
which way does it go
hah here it comes
show her how it works
no wires
answered this but
-um are there any items that you think his interest has changed around
between the last time and this time
this toys here
no okay
were not gonna play with the wires thank you
were gonna play over here
okay -um and which book of these do you think he would prefer
the one with the touch and feel one
and did you play with any similar kinds of toys like these at home
just the books but
we still dont do any pretend toys
we just use stuffed animals really to distract him like when were changing his diaper and stuff like that
he doesnt really play with
does he
i guess in his toy box he has like a stuffed cookie monster and an elmo
that he sometimes plays with
but -um its not a preferred thing
we usually
its not a preferred thing
and does he play with any dolls at home
just those stuffed animals
we dont have a doll at home
although i did think about getting one after the last time we were here haha
he seemed interested in the baby this time
he was more interested in it last time i think
now he just wants to lick the face
-um and i know we asked you this last time
but i dont remember what you said
d do you think he recognized any of those besides the bottle -um and the spoon
oops you found our microphone
no theres nothing else there that
you can move over this way
that he would have had
okay and last question
do you think there were any of these items that he would recognize the names of yet
book or story maybe
but you know a lot of the questions that are in the developmental questionnaires about asking if he recognizes words
its hard to know because so much of what we do is part of a routine
you know when we go and sit down in the rocking chair thats when were reading
so he knows were reading
theres one book that hes started to recognize that he actually says something when he sees
he has the book -um moo baa
its the sandra boyton book
and when he sees it he goes
you know that huh
so he knows that book
-um and then are there
so you answered my next question
yeah if there any th any items at home that you think he would recognize that he doesnt have here
so that particular book
by the name of it
yeah by the name of it
its so hard to know what words he knows because we pair everything with gestures
you know it was so hard to fill out those questionnaires because theres very little that we do without a gesture with it
you know when we say eat were always saying eat or walking over to his highchair or showing him food
when its time for a we say and show him the bottle
so you were having to take a guess but
im taking a guess on a lot of things
okay well thats fine
i mean i think he recognizes animal sounds
like moo and woof or whatever
okay well thats great
thats all we need
just a general idea of
but i mean his main thing now is just gross motor things
and hes just learned how to climb
and thats really what he wants to do
itll be interesting to see what hes like when he comes back in two years
hopefully hes talking when hes two
he comes back in two years
or he comes back when hes two
when hes two
so about a year
so i can go ahead and turn this off
okay so lets find out what do you think if anything is different about the kinds of things he liked today versus last time
-um i think i remember last time him throwing a lot of stuff
he really didnt want anything at all
he wanted the baby he played the baby and he threw everything else
-um this time hes actually picking up more than one thing at a time
and he wasnt doing that before either on when we did the play thing as far as i can remember
hes more interested in the other things and not just because he can put them in his mouth
but hes actually like using the spoon the way its sposta be useta feed the baby and
hes playing differently as well
thats those are big changes
its amazing just a couple weeks how it can make such a change
i know
we dont have any play food at home
i was gonna ask you of these toys do you have -um stuffed animals babydolls
-um we have some stuffed animals
we have books
we really only have books like in his bedroom
i have a book downstairs but he never never like plays with it downstairs
when hes in his bedroom and were sitting in his rocker he grabs for his books and wants me to read to him
any of these books -um the same as you have at home or similar
in other words would he recognize any of these
-um we have one thats similar to that fuzzy book
-um so
and we have the foot book but he thats one of the ones he closes every time i try to read it to him
he has a couple favorites that he wants to read all the time
do you remember what those are
-um moo baa la
and the other one is a a book similar to that but its like fuzzy animals
those are the ones he likes to read
it seemed like he liked animals
does he know any animals
does he know the names of them or sounds
we have -um four cats
so he he knows cats and he he makes the sound
my mom has a lot of dogs so he knows doggie
and we we do baby sign with him
and he does this for the sign for doggie
and sometimes hell sorta kinda bark
and does he know any like farm animals yet or does he do that stuff yet
no not
i mean i started to to show him cows and chickens and sheep -um on a computer game that i have but hes kinda slightly interested
i think maybe if they were the real thing he might be more interested
i wanna eventually take him somewhere where there are animals but i havent gotten to it yet
we went to the zoo when he was really little but that was more for just a moms outing than a babies outing
yeah these experiences kind of change as they get older
-um well what kinds of toys do you think are best for his personality
well he likes the babydolls a lot
and it seems like he really likes the food toys a lot
so we might have to be getting some -uh play food pretty soon
mhm it seemed like he was playing with several items
do you think he recognizes any of these items
the waffle he
well see we cut it up before we give it to him
so he probably wouldnt necessarily recognize that
same with the bread
we cut it up before we give it to him
i give him like grilled cheese sandwiches
and i give him like cinnamon toast
-um the spoon he would recognize
the plate
the pizza
spaghetti peas any of those
peas maybe
he throws them usually
-um he doesnt really prefer
hes hes really picky with food
i might have to start trying pizza because he might actually eat pizza
because like he likes a lot of different flavors he doesnt like just plain old chicken
he needs to have chicken with spices and stuff in it
thats unusual
yeah hes
does he like toys that make noise still
mhm yep
he likes things that he can shake that makes noise
and what else was i looking at
oh the peekaboo -um type of book does he like that
-um at home he does
but a lot of times if if its not the two books that he likes the best he likes to clo
but he likes to close that book too
so but he we have one peekaboo book at home
its like a sesame street peekaboo that you lift things up and he seems to be tickled by that
so he really likes the babydolls you said
yeah -uh when we go to play group the little girl has babydolls and hes always going after them
that and electronics
its just interesting because most of the kids his age dont really go for the babydoll
at all
youre unique
yeah the the the little girl is over a year shes like four thirteen or fourteen months
and she carries around her babydoll and they kind of fight over it
hell rip it away from her and try to play with it
and i gave him a cabbage patch kid at home
and he he plays with that
he definitely knows what it is
when you say it
and he started kissing him on his own
at home
it looked like he was feeding
yeah he was
and i was like wow
thats amazing
you are amazing bch
and hes walking already too
you are bch
wow bch
look oh my god he just stood up
that that was the first time hes done that
you stood up
hes never stood up without holding on to something
oh my gosh
okay we need a plaque on the wall
thats funny
parker bch
he took his first steps in the doctors appointment after he fell from the swing on our front porch
it was the three of us in the swing and the whole swing went
it was a front porch swing
and it he fell backwards wound up fracturing the back of his skull
and then the next day for our follow up appointment in the doctors office he walked for the first time
like coup just like two steps but
there goes the camera
parker bch
you come to momma bch
oh yeah bch
im almost done i just needta scan to make sure theres nothing else i missed
and he also likes balls a lot
oh thats another thing because several people have mentioned that and we dont have any but that their children like them
he he likes
hey parker bch
you like ball bch
look at mommy bch
ball bch
ball bch
what do you like to do with it
-um he he hell like toss it or throw it and you give it back to him he does does it back to you
thats cool
-um okay you dont have play food at home but you do have his cabbage patch doll
and you talked about recognizing
oh which things do you think interested him the least
well hes scared of that still
-um he seemed to be a little scared -um of this doggie for some reason i dont know if its that fluff around his neck
what are you doing buddy buds bch
-um the books at this point seem to not interest him as much as all the other toys
could be because theres so many other choices
i cant believe you bch
i cant believe youre so silly bch
alright i think thats all
now i gotta call daddy and tell him the next step bch
he -um he sat up from a laying down position really early too
hes been ahead of the game on the milestones
do you mind if i ask you a few questions
-um not so much
i mean i think he he kind of
well he i think he maybe self-directed himself a little more
in terms of he kind of moved through the toys more on his own i guess
-um and you know i tried to let him do that to see what he was interested in
-uh but not not a heck of a lot of difference
-um the toys that he chose to play with this time
well he i think he likes more of those toys
hes hes hes sort of somewhat interested in everything
he was less interested i think in the books this time
last time i think i tried to read him a book and this time i didnt
he didnt seem very into it
i mean i sort of did
but he didnt seem into it at all
-um he seemed actually kind of interested in this thing for for more than before
im not really sure why
-um and you know he seemed somewhat interested in the animals
but i think those toys are a little more interesting to him in in general
do you think he recognized the clock from home
i think he wants to teeth on it actually
i think its the texture
at first i thought he was trying to play peekaboo
hes been doing that a lot lately
like on the changing table he might pull up his onesie over his head and do peekaboo
-um but he likes things obviously like that that make a little bit of noise
and he is teething so
-um i mean he was last time too
he has a lot of teeth
and so i think hes looking also for a certain texture sometimes
do you think he recognized the word clock
how about any of the other toys this time
do you think he recognized any of their names
-uh you know i dont think so really
because -um yeah like we dont have like a fox at home
-um -uh i dont know
honestly these are really difficult
book maybe
-um doggie maybe
but im not sure
because like my my other son has a ton of stuffed animals
but none of them look like that
so i dont know if he recog
do you know what i mean
like if he really recognizes the words
im not sure
i feel like he doesnt recognize a lot of words yet
but i think he understands like intonation and and meaning more so
like you know when when youre like dont touch that kind of thing versus like you know trying to be more like happy about something
i think he understands that much more than than the words themselves
that makes sense
-um any foods -um that he might
well the peas that he eats are a little more pureed than that
so i dont know
i mean and weve started to obviously because he has -um you know good swallowing and chewing
ive been trying to do some like mashed peas for him without the skin
-um he might recognize them
but im not really sure
the waffle he has some wheat free ones that he has occasionally
so he might recognize that
but theyre round not square
so i dont know
and how about at home
any changes in the toys that hes been playing with at home
you know not really
the funny thing is actually like i feel like here maybe its because theres its quieter and less distractions but like he sat and played with all the toys
and at home i feel like if you try to get him interested in something hell wanna go and like play with the dogs toys or go and like you know -uh pull up the plants or something like that
like hes much more into doing something else other than like kind of sitting here and playing with the different toys in a way even when you try to do that with him
its kind of funny
i dont know
-um how about any activities that you played
i know you had -um
that we do at home versus here
well yeah or maybe that you did do here
either one
it doesnt have to be different than what you did here
well we do similar things at at home
like we might play with certain types of toys or -um try and read a book or play with like stuffed animals or things like that
so i mean its somewhat the same
i mean a a lot of times like i say i think hes more active at home
i think thats -um
oh maybe what what do you think he was most interested in
-um i think those spoons at the end there actually
that he was interested in that pitcher for a little bit and the spoons
i think he liked trying to stick them in his mouth
and i think he liked the sound that they made and the fact that there was more than one of them
-um but yeah i think
and a little bit with the the bee like when it bounced
he smiled when i did that a little bit
-um so
but i think for himself i think the the spoons
do you find youre using -um like a lot of sound effects at home when you like use animals and things because thats what he he likes sound effects
-um im not sure if i u -uh
i dont know if i u
i mean i guess i do to some extent
you know
its kinda fun watching him like trying to figure these things out and that kind of stuff
-um yeah i mean i think he likes being surprised sometimes
like he loves playing peekaboo
sometimes like you can really get him laughing
and -um he has this clacker toy that its its a musical thing that he thinks its hysterical
i dont know why
you know like
but thats like one of the few things he responds to like that
so i guess he does like
he likes getting like you know raspberries on his skin and stuff like that
he likes -um you know -uh being sort of like held up and down kind of thing
so i mean he -um -uh i think he he sort of likes a diversity of activities i guess
and at one point i could tell he was trying to make a poop
thats okay
-uh so you think this time he he probably preferred the books least
id say least this time
yeah definitely
seems to be liking that pile over there
yeah today he really seemed into it
yeah hes into throwing stuff too so
and im not sure if hes doing it for the this part of it or to hear them like as they you know kind of crash together kind of thing
thank you very much for coming in
we always appreciate it
okay no problem
yeah normally its like im trying to get him to you know stay out of trouble
he was great
okay im gonna ask you some questions now
about the play session you just had
so what was the first thing that she went to
big circle clock
she bit on it
like that
is it familiar do you have anything like that at home or
we do but its not foamy
its its this color and it has the dials but its not made out of this
its wood
oh so but she does have a toy -um
its not a toy but she plays with it
oh its a real one
its for their play room so its for kids but its not soft like this one
but its the exact same colors
so i dont know if she likes the texture of it if she likes the colors im not sure
when i pretended it was a hat she threw it off so she i think she knows its not a hat
we pretended it was a plate and she just really just wanted to bite it
now what did she go to after that
-um well i kind of pretended the frog was leaping on her and she was excited about the frog after he was pretending to kiss her neck
she was laughing a little bit
and then she went straight for the food
which is what she did last time when we were here
she likes the food
specifically the peas
but she didnt find those right away
she played with the plates
so something about circles maybe
and she was playing with mostly playing with the plates at first and then i showed her that these were here and then this was all she really wanted to play with
so i dont know if its color or the tex
im not sure what it is about these but she likes these
she wasnt as interested in the baby this time
in fact she didnt really seem to like the baby this time
-um she didnt really interact much with her didnt wanna feed her didnt wanna hold her hair like she did before
so last time she played with the baby
she did
for quite a bit of time
and she would feed it and do stuff like that
she wasnt interested today
maybe because i pretended she was my baby
-um does she have like one like that at home
not that big but she does have babydolls
and she plays with them sometimes
did she play with the clock a lot last time too
i dont think she played with the clock before at all
was it here
i dont she even noticed it before
and the animals
you said she really liked the frog
she liked the frog
shh -um no she doesnt have a frog at home
she has a lot of stuffed animals but not i dont think she has one that looks like this
she didnt seem interested in the rest of them
she actually fed one of them
she fed the fox her peas
when i asked her if shell give him some peas
she fed them to her
to the fox
she wasnt interested in the donkey at all
i thought the colors would get her attention but she didnt seem interested
and she played with this little bottle
might remind her of her own bottle
does she do a lot of play at home
she has a lot of toys little small toys that she plays with in her pack and play
and then her and i will crawl around and play with different stuff
shes got tons of toys
she has three siblings that are like not much older than her
so yeah
so are most of the toys that you have at home things like this that are imitations of real things or
we have play food and we have a a large play room in our basement and we have play food down there and she always goes straight to that
i do not know if she thinks its real or if she just likes the texture
im not sure but of course everythings in her mouth at this stage
so i do not know if she thinks its food or if she just wants to explore
but she really likes the peas
i dont know what it is about those peas
and usually at home she likes noisy toys that make noise
a lot of music type things
we have a microphone toy that she sings in it she just puts it the whole thing almost in her mouth
and she talks in it
really loud into it
its a microphone so
i think she likes to hear herself
and that keeps her occupied
and then any of the toys that have lots of lights and stuff on it shes excited
kennedy bch
what about the -um over there
the the books
you know i didnt really do anything with the books i think theyre behind me i didnt even see them over here
but we do have lots of books at home and lots of thick books that she she usually just bites on them
and at story time of course at night we read them and shell have her attention there for a couple seconds but she just not really interested in sitting and hearing the whole book yet
do you have of of those
these specific books
we have one i i think its this one it might be just really similar
its got the different things you can touch
and then
no thats it
just similar to this one but not we dont have that
i have doctor seuss books but not this one in particular
and goodnight moon it sounds familiar but i dont think we have it at home
i might have just seen it when i was here
is there anything else you that noticed that was different than the last time or anything she did that surprised you today
-um she actually gave the stuffed animals although i only tried a few of them she gave them a little bit more attention this time than she did before
-um shes kinda doing the same
she didnt like the doll as much this time
so i dont know why that is
but last time she was trying to put shoes on it and everything
-um and she didnt notice the books either maybe just because of where they are
in relation to where im sitting yeah
other than that
she liked the pizza because i think she likes the colors
she was here last
about a month
so do you notice any differences overall
on how shes playing or what shes interested in
-um shes a lot more interested in containers
in and out
she will actually help clean up now on her own
which is really helpful
i dont know if that says something about me or
but she likes to do that
she likes building toys
much more into cause and effect -um kinds of things
the the little popper with the animals
where you push the different things
she cant quite work that part yet
but she knows that when we do it the little things pop up
and she likes to put the faces back down so well pop them back up
-uh what else do you like aoife
she actually realy likes puzzles now
-um and very much over the past month has gotten into she liked sitting and reading before
but now she will go get books for us to read to her
instead of us sitting down saying okay we are gonna read a story
shell you know get books out of the little basket and come find us with it
so you said she does have favorites
okay what kind of books are those
theres an abc book that she likes because her dad sings it to her
thank you
-um she has a couple books with baby faces that she likes
-um the eric carle book from head to toe
because we do the actions with it
and she will do some of them to mimic us
a couple of like the sandra boynton books that weve just been reading forever
so she knows the pictures she knows the story
shell actually nod you know after youve finished a page like yes youve said it correctly and then turn it
but she its actually a pretty wide variety of books that she likes
she likes -um you know the ones with the real animals that you can touch
pretty much everything
but she does like the ones especially that we have downstairs
where we have to you know sing or do an action or
so interactive types of study
and she is unbelievably active
all the time
yeah she
i dont have much of a comparison but
she does seem active
i mean they all are at this age to some extent
but -um shes very curious about the other things going on
mhm yeah
and shes she always has been interactive with other people
she really likes other babies and really likes people -um
you said shes more interested in you than she is in the toys
by far
mom said that right
-um so then how about babydolls is she interested in faces like that
not particularly
not so much
-um she has started to like -um
a hug
-um she has started to like her sorta stuffed animals more
she will take a teddy bear and hug it
-um shell try to give it her bottle
-um but more of the teddy bears than the babydolls
the babydolls shes just kinda
how about little -um you said a number of
does she know any of those names for those kinds of animals
-um she knows duck
she knows pig
she knows cat
she knows dog
-um i would guess she knows frog
-um cause she will actively seek out if there is a frog in a picture
she will actively seek out and make sure she touches the frog
i guess she knows bear
theres some very unusual ones in here and i wouldnt think that most kids would know some of them
the donkey and the groundhog yeah
yeah of course mommy picked the strange ones
or they dont come up as much for you
thats right
you do know hippopotamus though
well the stories but not the hippopotamus
so shes actually heard that word a number of times
where you going
how about the food items
is she eating foods like any of these kinds of foods
-um she eats peas
she loves peas
-um she eats cheese
she eats bread
-um she eats waffles though she didnt go after that all
-um shes never had an mm cookie but she will have animal crackers
pretty much all veggies
she doesnt like spaghetti which i think is odd
but she does love berries
which you know the strawberries and the raspberries are bright red
she sees something red i think and immediately thinks it might be a berry
got your scarf
-uh huh -um
keep you warm
let us see -um
she did play with
bring it over
bring it over
food items she did sorta was interested in those today
mm okay
and again although we asked for some for christmas she didnt get any
weve probably asked you in the past if she has
i know you said she has stuffed animals and books
does she have any of these types of things
nope we dont have any of these kinds of things
although she -um a couple of babydolls -um although we have started
thank you should mommy put that on
okay no didnt even look huh
thank you for bringing that over
theyre soft
-um we have started having her eat off of f instead of just kind of just putting it on trays plates and bowls
-um so shes now more familiar with plates and
she picked em up
has she had any ice cream cones
or any ice cream
shes had like a piece of like a popsicle but that doesnt look anything like the
it doesnt look no
shes had pizza crust
you found your book aoife good memory
either that or its by chance but regardless you found it
okay i think i might have covered everything i needta ask you
when she comes back for her two year old visit there will be a different set of toys which will be nice
and -um
what do you think he enjoyed the most today
ah the fake bottles
the little juice cup and the little bottle
do you have that kind of food at home
we do
weve got a little pretend kitchen set
and he and his sister spend a lot of time playing at it
and playing with the food
so some of these things we have at home
ah which ones do you have
we have the icecream cone
we have pasta that looks similar to that
and the peas
-um and have one fake bottle
but its a fake milk bottle
-um we dont have big wooden ones like this
i think he liked the weight of them
he liked playing with the peanut butter jar
no he doesnt stack so much yet
he likes to knock things down when i stack them
or especially if his sister stacks them
she likes stacking
he likes knocking down
they make a good pair
-um today was actually the first time that id seen him take something gently from the top of the stack instead of just knocking the whole thing over
normally he just likes to go kaboom with them
but today he actually picked something up off the top
well yeah i mean he probably recognizes peas because we both eat peas and have toy peas at home
-um dont really eat peanut butter
-um and the kids dont really have much juice
but i think he probably just from the playing recognizes it
because his sister does drink juice
he does not
so he may recognize that word as something that hes not normally allowed to have
like no thats sabrinas juice
-um hes also teething
it could just be that he likes gnawing on them because it hits some of the back or you know some of the back gums
hey baby
what do you think he liked the least today
the stuffed animals
every time
he just doesnt care about them
like i dont know if hes played with them at all when hes been here
and we have stuffed animals at home
and he rarely
unless they have like something jingly inside them
he just doesnt care about them
-um he might
-um maybe more regular ones like just dog and cat and stuff
he might recognize some of those
but he just doesnt really like playing with stuffed animals
ah how about the books was that a big success today or
ah hes generally sort of luke warm about books
-um ill read to him when im nursing him
and hell listen
and sometimes like when im burping ill keep reading to him
-um he doesnt really have the patience to sit and listen to the word books at this point in time
hed rather chew on them
or if he can get his hands on paper books he likes to try and pull the paper because it makes paper
he loves noise
you do
-um so his interest in the books here is about his interest in the books at home
-um if im reading to his sister he likes to be on my lap too
and well all read together
that is not for you
he loves wires
loves wires
if you had a pile of wires and electronics remotes you know cameras iphones anything like that thats what he would would play with
ah which books did you read today
-um we did put me in the zoo
and what was the other
oh we looked at the farm one
he does have a touchy -um book on -um like vehicles
trucks and stuff
that he like to read
that will entertain him when hes in the car
-um you know he guess he likes the feeling of them
and put me in the zoo he just picked up and handed to me
we dont have this one at home
weve read it before
but we dont have it at home
go ahead
im sorry
i was just gonna ask
so -um just to get the gist of it
what do you think that -um everything that he liked today had in common
hard stuff that he could chew on
hard or hardish
he likes the textures
and he likes things that make noise
its actually it was an idea i got last time when we were here
there was already the little cookie in here
and he liked rattling it back and forth
and so we spent some time putting you know things
and once i put the first thing in he followed my direction and was putting more stuff in
-um but he liked the rattling
-um you know rattling this stuff
and i guess the touch of the the books
you keep grabbing the pizza
is that the most typical thing that he
we dont have this at home
but at our play group theres a
it looks exactly like this just bigger
piece of pizza
its the thing that they all fight over
theres only one piece
im sure that there were more at some point in time
and kids probably walked off with the other pieces
i dont know what is so fascinating about it
but he was playing with the pizza
and every time he picked up some
thank you
would you like it back
you cannot have the wire
-um so no i dont know whats fas
maybe its the texture
-um but he was playing with it a lot
and -um yeah its a big favorite at play group too
ah how about the baby doll
we have a couple baby dolls at home
they are his sisters baby dolls
he occasionally expresses interest in them
mainly when she is trying to play with them
he doesnt really look at them when hes on his own
or when shes not around
-um so -um i was trying to see if he would look at it and be like
oh look its a baby doll
you can play with it and feed it and stuff like that
are you upside down
he likes being upside down
hell crawl and put his head on the ground and try and do a somersault
likes being upside down
into climbing on everything
yeah the daredevil
yeah very physical
does he play with his sister with the baby doll
its generally trying to grab the baby doll and chew on her face
or you know i think its plastic
its not real hard
you know probably felt good against his gums
and it gives the added benefit of ah teasing her because shes trying to play with it
-um yeah
thats entertainment most days is them figuring out how to annoy the other one
were there any differences on how he played here today and how he plays at home
-um not a lot
at home we have more -um cars and trucks
he likes those a lot
and things with wheels that he can move
and we also have -um a lot of little people figures
like the fisherprice little people
and he likes playing with those
ah but its yeah trucks and little people he likes a lot
-um so you guys dont have them here
but yeah he doesnt have much interest in stuffed animals at home either
and youve got a new friend
careful stevie
do not pull hair
do not pull hair
be gentle
youve gotta be gentle
you do not know your own strength
good listening
look at you
thats sweet
how about across the visits
do you remember
he never really played with the stuffed animals
hes always sort of looked at the books
and has spent most of the time chewing on the food
i mean its pretty much been the same each of our visits here
-um and once or twice making a break for the wires
-um yeah but its been pretty common
its always been the food that hes played with -um the most
but that makes sense for how he plays at home as well
he likes playing with that stuff
and -um one thing he didnt do today that he normally does at home is -um
hes spent a lot of time lately taking two things and banging them against each other
or banging them on the table
like that seems to be his -um entertainment of choice recently is the banging
trying to think
what else do you do at home
yeah its strange because honestly i dont see him play on his own all that often
because he and his sister are always playing together so that kind of changes the dynamic of things
because the two of them are interacting and either avoiding each other
or one of them is trying to take the others things
either shes trying to take his stuff
or hes trying to take her stuff
and sometimes they trade back and forth and actually play w in the same space nicely
which is awesome
-um and really cool to see
-um but its just there isnt much time that he doesnt have somebody else around him
either a play group or with his sister at home thats in the same general space playing with him
so thats i guess a difference of being here versus being at home as well
i was just thinking just having seen him react to you know well definitely the no
do you think he knows the name book
he might know book
im not sure
he does know no
whether or not he chooses to mind me he knows no
you know hes got a handful of words that he definitely knows
and the rest of them its its kind of amorphous as to
is it that hes responding to my t like when i said
oh hand me the book
and let me read it to you
he handed it to me
but is it because i said book
is it because i said hand it to me
is it because of my tone
or is it because my hand is out like this
and thats what hes holding
-um because he likes to share
hell crawl over to me and hand me something
and ill take it and be like
oh thank you
and hand it back to him
and that makes him happy because hes sharing
-um i dont know if he knows the word book
he might
i guess it depends on what foods hes eating for him to have a level of excitement to eat it
-um not really because i mean its were still having a lot of junky baby food
we dont dont really get into the whole baby signing thing
-um the two signs that i had learned were more and enough
and so when ive been feeding him ive been trying to go
okay do you want more
you want more
at which point his two and a half year old sister pipes up
i want more
i want more
like you already have your words
you dont needta do that
but today for the first time i was feeding him
and i was giving him some bits of hotdog -um at lunchtime which was unusual for him
and he kept going like this and going
and i tried giving him some cheerios which he also had
and he kind of threw them of his plate and kept going
and so i was like
do you want this
and he started shoveling another piece of hotdog into his mouth
so that was the first time that actually worked
it never worked with his sister
so now i think i might have to learn a few more to teach him
besides more
so i dont think that he knows food names yet
other than you know
either he gets food or he doesnt
-um well probably work on water or milk
ah to try and really see if
the drinks are ah
sometimes i cant tell if hes thirsty or not
or hell go and get in a big fight with his sister
and i find out it was because he was after her water bottle
and its like oh yours was empty
i didnt realize that
other than yeah screams and cries
-um but yeah the bulk of his words are you know
come here
we know that he r like
wheres your sister
like hell look around for sabrina
you know
but i dont know i just remember with his sister that it was at some point she was crawling around
and i was like
okay its naptime
lets go upstairs
and i didnt gesture in any way
she just crawled to the stairs and started going upstairs
i dont remember how old she was at that point
but it was just like
wow how long had this been building that i was able to say this sentence to her
and shes nowhere near talking
but she understood and followed it
its cool
theyre cool
so compared to with like past visits because this is your third session right
like what was different that like the toys she took interest in as opposed to other past ones
she took a little bit more interest in the baby than in the past but
she pretty much just likes the plastic food
-um which items in particular was she pretty interested in
-uh definitely the bottle and the sippycup
does she have like items in her environment at home that are similar to that do you think thats why or
yeah she was drinking some juice in a bottle on the way here
i noticed like kind of just a little bit from what ive heard like you tend to like be like into different like actions or positions emphasize that is there any in particular like like you play at home or
she likes to be upside-down
and she likes to be tickled
shes very active and so we
we let her be active
thats good
she looks like she was having fun with it
-um do anything of these toys like fit her personality well at this stage or
oh you like that bottle
pretty much anything she can get her mouth on is all that she likes right now
come on stand up
no you wanna be upside-down
ah you singing
singing us a pretty song
does she have -um have any like plastic food at your ha home
or stuffed animals or anything
weve got a couple of stuffed animals but shes never shown any interest
except to chew on them
more a food person
most of the toys that she has at home are hard plastic theyre not food but theyre hard plastic toys
similar or anything
did you notice any difference in how she interacted the food like
i know some kids will like bang stuff together and i dont know stuff like that
this was the first time shes re definitely recognized that as a bottle this time
because she always put the nipple in into her mouth
she still banged it with the other things but
she knew what it was
shes funny
yeah pretty much
is that silly
so there wasnt really any other food besides like the bottle or the sippycup that she paid much attention to
not really
she likes that
thats gotta hurt
thats gotta hurt baby
i know theres carpet
weve got progo at home so theres a lot of padding compared to that
you like the keys
have you noticed her language are into like after doing these sessions like do you think she like remembers anything from them for the next time she comes back or
i dont know
she hasnt really
well she mightve remembered the clock
she liked pulling things off of it last time
you wanna be upside-down again
shes like a diver or something
you sure are squirmy
kay well i think thats it then
you ready to go baby
thank you so much for coming
no problem sorry i was late
you gonna let me and mommy talk
is it okay if i ask some questions
so what do you think she -um liked the most today
shes into food
she shouldnt be hungry
shes had enough food
was she into food last time too
she was into some of the food items
a lot of the food items
there was more
i mean she was into the pizza again
the waffle
the cheese she didnt play with the cheese today really
-um she was holding the peas can
not the peanut butter but i thought it was something else here but
the definitely the peas can
and she was into the biting the spaghetti
oh i think i at least heard
and she was looking at the cookie and the hamburger
but she was playing with that and i mean she plays with the bottle and the cup
but it was like food
is she familiar do you think with the words
yeah pizza she shes familiar with
i mean her brothers love pizza
and so we make homemade pizza -um
cheese she hears
and we have cheese on the pizza for example
-um her brothers like waffles
so thats
they like waffles dont they
the boys
you know
most mornings the boys are like can i have a waffle
a lot of mornings its no
he liked the peas but i think it was more the shape and the color
he doesnt
he doesnt eat things in that format
and she likes the spoons and stuff
she goes into the drawers
im gonna catch you
you wanna talk to the babydoll
oh thats nice
and i noticed -uh you call her not alex but you have like another name or
we have nicknames for her
she goes by alex
or ally
or allyboo
and so she
or like her dad calls her girlyboo
because her brothers are the boos
so shes the girlyboo
oh no coughing
shes sometimes occasionally called by her middle name
what is her middle name
oh thats nice
and so
shes getting useta a lot of names
but she answers she knows its her
she comes running
-uh what about the books
didnt she interested in anything today
i mean she looked at the -um
the one that was
where she
am i sitting on it
-um no the on the farm book
she was interested in that
and other than just opening and closing the books not really anything
like when she was interested in
she wasnt really interested in the animals today
except for she did pick up the zebra
has she been in the past interested in the animals on the other visits
the first visit she was into the pooh and the eagle
because i thought it was just red
she really useta really be into red things
and now its more like food items
she seems to be
like shes picking up the dish and shes picking up the spaghetti
she did that the last time was eating the spaghetti and was playing with that
the cups and
the different food items
she wasnt interested in the baby the last time at all so this time she sort of looked at the baby
do you have babies at home
shes the baby
there is a babydoll and but and theres a lot of stuffed animals but she nor her brothers have ever really been interested i mean she has like a cow that she sort of walks around with occasionally
and tries to nibble on but its not
none of them have really
none of them were into -um
stuffed animals
particularly i mean
the boys had pacifiers and that was their friend they never really got into them i mean
and alex with play with some of them but
not really much
but now shes playing with them
what do you think -um attracts her to the food
i thought it was the brightness of the colors originally like last time
sorry not last week
last time
anything red she went after so she went after the spam
and the hat on the donkey or eagle or the thing
and then
last time she sorta was attracted to food
and i thought well maybe its food around the house but she was really into the spaghetti
i thought okay its the red thing again
-um or the icecream she was into the last time but this time shes more into
sort of food that she sort of sees or eat because shes had a little bit of spaghetti at home in the last few weeks for the first time
brothers have the pizza
we have cabinets with cans in it and she goes into the cabinets now and tries to grab the cans
so i think it may be sort of things that she actually sort of recognizes cookie
brothers like cookies
thats interesting
do you think when youre talking to her and kind of cheer like -uh i dont know saying like propper or social things
do you think she like catches on like
sorry youre welcome things like that
shes starting to like she will nod her head
or -um she doesnt say yes or no or anything like that but -um
she says hi she says bye
she waves
if you say come here shell come
-um if youll say you know leave the cat alone then shell leave sam alone
oh okay
you know goofs off with her brothers when we tell her to stop she generally stops
well thats nice
thats very nice
and did you say at home does she enjoy books at home
what kind of toys is she playing with home
at home shes playing more with -um we have one of those fisher price tables
we have two types
one we have the old fashioned type that doesnt sing or do anything like a leapster and the other ones like the leapster type
so shell go and the one she plays with more
if you push buttons itll make music theres like a little book and if you flip the book then itll play one type of tune if you flip it the other way itll play a different type of tune
oh cool
and so like one of the book pages you flip and it starts doing the song so she sits there and looks like shes trying to dance and trying to sing to it so you get these sounds that sound like out of her
oh thats really cool
so shell do that
you know she roughhouses with her brothers
ah no
excuse me missy
you cant tear up the place
she explores a lot so this is typical like finding her finding the paperclip and stuff thats
excuse me
i mean we constantly have to keep things out of her mouth
-um you know she has you know blocks and things like that in her -um
pack and play but she more like cruises around the house and looks for things to grab onto
and she has like a soft book that she flips and will drag it around the house with her thats
oh okay
-um like a bath toy
then like
hi yes
she has drawers that she can like pull out and play
and so she takes the kitchen stuff out
so she does that or -um
we have a lazy susan in our kitchen
and it has all the kids dishes and plates and cups and
so shell go in and pull out all the cups and put them on the floor or like pull down all the plates and
theyre all over the house or something like that
we have to pick them up and wash them and put them back
be careful
oh so funny
so its sort of
i guess theres conventional play like she has like toys
floating around but then she goes through and
hey no dont do that
dont do that
its -uh funny because one of my girlfriends daughters got into that phase
like gagging herself and she thought it was so funny
except for when it actually worked and then she was really upset you know
the child you know
shes like oh i didnt like that
no aw
thats dirty you made the spoon dirty
are you laughing about that
are you gonna get it out and bring it back
you guys did a great job thank you
what did you guys play with first
-um i guess the food
-um does he have pretend food at home
-um what did he pick up that he recognizes or that he may have had before
-um well i mean i guess hes seen all of this stuff twice before
but its been a while
i do not know each time hes liked to play with the plastic stuff and the food
and again its in the middle so i dont know if that has anything to do with it
but when i try to get him interested in the other toys he seems more interested in that
-um the doll he had the same reaction he had last time
which was to try and give it lots of baby kisses
-um which foods did he pick up
the pizza and i guess the bread
and the hamburger and the salami
and then he played a lot with the plates and the spoon
which arent food
but food related
-um what did you play with next
what next
-um he spent pretty much the whole time playing with the food and the dishes
he stopped to eat the baby dolls face periodically
he wasnt very interested in reading books
right now
yeah we did a couple pages
do you play that game at home
yeah he loves peek a boo he plays it in lots of different forms
-um yeah i try to play with him with the puppets and stuffed animals a little bit but he was mainly interested in going back and doing this kind of thing
which animals did you play with
-um the kangaroo puppet
the deer
i tried to show him the zebra and the chicken and the otter but he didnt really
seem interested
okay well thank you
so which toys do you think she was the most interested in
-um the pizza
not sure why
you found it
didnt you
was it the same as last time
-um i dont think so i think she liked the keys more last time
which she still liked this time
thats why you have this
-um and
why do you think she was most interested in the pizza
i dont know
i set it up when we first got in here
i dont know if she saw that or
just likes the texture of it
okay what do you think she was least interested in here
stuffed animals
-um did you look at any books while you were here
-uh just one
she was more interested in playing with the toys though
is that typical for her
she usually likes to at least look at the books
but theres so much more stuff to look at
that shes not useta at home
do you have similar toys at home
we have food
and books
and stuffed animals
nothing exactly the same
mhm what about the doll
does she have things like that
oh yeah
she loves dolls
im sure her older sister has some too
just a few
-um do you think she would recognize the name of any of the objects we have here
books and bottles and maybe some of the food
and obviously the doll
okay and -uh
does she eat any of the foods that we have here
yeah shell eat pizza and bread and cheese and waffles
cheese doesnt look exactly like ours
alright is there anything else you think we should know about her play
are there things that are different that she does at home that we didnt see here
i dont think so
i mean other than putting everything in her mouth
normally she doesnt have her pacifier in her mouth
so everything goes in
that seems to be pretty typical for kids of this age
say hi
so what would you say were her favorite was
the baby and the icecream cone which actually were the same favorite toys from the last time we were here
thats funny
does she have those toys at home or any others
-um we have play food
we have -uh wooden play food so its just different
and we have babydolls but theyre in her sisters room so she doesnt usually play
and its funny the past three times weve been here she never goes near these toys and her two year old sister has like a whole collection of them and loves them and doesnt let her touch them and even like alone when i try to get her to play with them shes like no
im like afraid to go there
which of these toys does her sister have
she has
i mean she has a lot of toys just you know small ones like that but she has the sea other and
she has a pink poodle its not exactly the same
she has a fox like this
and then she has like a different frog but like similar toys
i think just in general she tries to steer clear of this
which of these foods has she seen before
shes had everything
she eats pretty much whatever we eat for dinner now so
yeah so anything thats there shes eaten
does she like them a lot does she like these ones
she loves peas
she likes icecream
you love it
-um i dont know if shed recognize that we usually give her shredded cheese
or cut up in really tiny thats only the other thing i would say is that usually when she does eat everythings cut up really small so
like the spaghetti wouldnt look like a pile like that for example
yeah -um
i know she looked at these books
we have a bunch of other caring cats books that she really likes
-um and we do a lot of reading with her but we dont have any of these exact books except we have a lot that
shes seen all of the animals in this book
she didnt do it today but she does make several of the animal noises
at home when we read her animals books like shell do a cow and a sheep
-um what else
shell do a duck
she just didnt wanna do it today
-um lets see what about these
does she play with yours
she does she loves mine
or like my phone
anything thats like not really a toy like she likes all these better than like the knockoff toy version
-um yeah so anytime she can get a hold of my keys she likes to play with those
-um lets see
she played with those two or is that
i kinda pulled those out and tried to get her to see like would she do it because i was wondering that after the past couple times if shed play with these kinda toys if her older sister wasnt around and she was kind of like wasnt feeling it
either not interested or like conditioned to know not to touch those
and its not like i dont let her play with them at home but just the second she gets them her sister like rips them out of her hand
no matter what i try to do so
what about this one does she eat a lot of these
not too many cookies but she does have them -um
or how about this
shell eat pizza too yeah
she eats everything
she does eat everything
yes she does
-um well she has ten teeth too she has molars so
-um so she probably eats things that other kids her age might not be eating because she has the tooth capacity to do it
you gonna give that baby another big kiss
lets see does she have like toy food and everything
yeah we have like a little play kitchen and then like i said most of our toys are wooden or we have felt food too
that she plays with
wheres that baby going
how about has she been on a farm or to a zoo and seen these
yeah we gotta the zoo my parents have a farm
with horses and chickens and
pheasants bees
-um so she gets you know she gets that and we were just at a petting zoo last week down in south carolina
come on
-um and we just tend to do a lot of like animal books and when we do shows she watches a lot of animal shows and
right sweetie
-um do you wanna fill this out now
sure i can
is that okay if she keeps playing okay
sure yeah
heres a
oh theres one there
okay thanks
so im ask you some questions
so -um what do you think she liked the most today
the pizza
the play food yeah
she definitely liked that
and the icecream cone
she kinda tried a little bit of everything
she did
is it -um different from last time or the last two times
no i think its pretty much similar
from what i remember
was -uh the pizza her favorite last time or
i dont know if she had a particular last time i cant remember
and she always likes stuffed animals
and shes been playing a lot more with her books at home
so we kinda think its funny because she just sits there and read but -er flips the pages
so do you have any books like that at home
yeah we have all these kinda
thats why i put that up
she was gonna rip that one
all these -uh board books kinda
and anything doctor seuss
yeah we have a lot of books
right erin
do you have one like that
she will go through her bin at home and pull that like theres toys and stuff but shell pull that book out
because of the
she can feel everything
you didnt see that one huh
and everything must go in her mouth
-um let me think
does she eat any of those foods
-um y she i mean she will have pizza but yeah
i havent really ventured out much more than
basic foods with her so
does she do you think she recognizes it or no
no i think it was just the right size to go into her mouth and the right you know
plastic chewing
but the -um baby bottle she recognized because she right away and tha the juice cup right there which shes play with now but yeah she knew that this was a you know a bottle
do you have a babydoll at home
she has soft babydolls
not one like this but she has little soft ones
does she ever try to feed the baby or
because i know you were trying to do it
no shes never
im laughing because she has a walker thing thats a stroller
and we put the babydoll in there but li she prefers to walk the dish towel
so she will grab the dish towel and put it over the
so i dont think she knows or she has like a little -um stuffed rabbit
thats like a little blank and shell walk that
but thats what she sleeps with every night so thats her connection
well that makes sense
so its either lovie or the dish towel
thats funny have you started using utensils
shh i mean we feed her with a spoon but she doesnt use anything she uses just her hands
so you dont think she would recognize the spoon
she probably would recognize the spoon yeah
but she wouldnt gravitate towards it
no i dont know if she saw it to be honest with you
i mean i think theres a lot here
see something
i knew you were going
so -um what kind of stuffed animals do you have at home
are they similar
-um yeah we had a huge winnie the pooh that she
well its huge its about the size of her that she likes
-um like her little stuffed rabbit blanket she loves
and any you know at christmas time i had a ton of little holiday bears and
shell find them and pull them down and she gives them like hugs
she loves stuffed animals yeah
and we have those like learning ones those like leapfrog ones
theres one that actually says her name and stuff so she has that she likes that one too
youre silly
what are those
everything in the mouth
-um i noticed she was banging things around
yes thats her shell shh yeah i mean we ha you know she got blocks for christmas and so its just you know constant
is that what you do
anything to make noise
like that
-um i also noticed that you were saying the colors of things
do you do that often are you trying to teach her or
yeah definitely trying to teach her so
anything we can
does she gravitate towards one particular
i dont think so
is her room in particular
its obnoxiously pink
and lime green and all pastels
oh thats cute
so im trying to put a little more purple into her
yeah right so youre not too pink
so do you play games like -um pattycake or like
she loves peek a boo
with that same dish towel
she will go and grab it
and -uh
and sometimes well catch her by herself playing
so we go over and play with her so she thats her favorite
thats cute
thats the babydoll
say hi baby
hi baby aw you give the baby a hug
thats quite a hug
and -um what kind of words of encouragement do you use like -um
do you clap a lot or do you say like yay
we clap and say go erin
yeah we clap or we do like a little dance for her
and so shell start doing her
yeah right yay erin
thats good
yeah and she knows it
thats good
that babys kinda heavy for you huh
it is a big baby
its really
i dont know why we have such a big baby in here
i know its like the size of her
hello baby
oh sure
so -um
what do you think her favorite thing was to play with today
i tried to get her
shes in this section
this plastic
fake food
and which food in particular
-uh i do not know
if it was a particular food
she pretty much likes anything that makes noise
generally is banging them together
this kind of stuff
i would say
i noticed that too
whats she think about that
thats interesting last time she was really
into that
fascinated by it and this time shes kinda
take it or leave it
does she have any at home
-uh not the hard plastic kind
but the soft
and shell lay her in bed and kind of hug it but
shes got a twin brother that
what a thing doll
does she
-um do anything with the
the dolls at home
besides just hugging them like
she would with like a real child almost
do you know what i mean
not yet
i think shes starting to get the potential to be interested in doing some of that
shes starting to mimic
a little bit
-um what was her least favorite
toys or area
eh probably the stuffed animals
cause she really engage in books
are a little over her head
kind of books
but this kind of stuff shell really
like she made it through the whole book
these guys she just kinda
does she have a
does she know any of those animals
like do you think the
not that i can tell
i noticed that you -um
made the
the animal noises a lot
you do that a lot at home
do you think she
connects them
you know cow seems to be the one that i
she seems to wanna mimic
the sound im making
on cow but the rest of them
she points at them and will even kind of outline them
with her hand and kinda circle
so she sees them
i do not know
that she knows specifics
do you -um
do you mean the word cow
or the
the picture of it in the book
right but she chose to mimic
oh im sorry
yeah no thats
-um the word
yes not the words
i havent seen her do that one time
and so you said like the
do you think those sounds are easier maybe for him to say
one syllable
then repeat
what else
your yourself
now the food
that you said she likes a lot
does she have
toy food at home
thats one thing we
we useta have it
for my son
and then
got rid of it after my son and then
had a couple more
haha so we just havent
thats one thing we havent replaced yet
do you feed her like -um
sandwiches at home yet
so do you think she would relate
mm -uh cause its just recent
just recent
she does
she is my little observer
and shell sit there and watch as i make anything
so i do
tell her about it so i do not know what she retains
at all but
and how about desserts does she
do you know that
not once haha
has ever had anything think
do you think she sees her older brother do you think
she doesnt really care
from meat to cracker to
cheerio to anything
shell eat whatever right now
is she
usually utensils
ah shes just starting to get interested in
trying with the spoon with the fork
hand me a little
plastic fork shes not
you know great but
yeah shes showing interest in doing that
to hold it and try
do you use a lot of words of encouragement
at home
cause i noticed you saying some here
can you give some examples
well i
tell her when shes doing something right
like if i say sela can you do this
and she does what i say im
good job and then -uh
a little personal
shes excited about something that she did
you know
acknowledge just anything really that
is positive for her
and want her to know
thats great
and what did she play with last time
what was her same
the same
exact -um
she really
was into the books last time too but this doll seemed to dominate
last time for some reason
so no stuffed animals any of the last few
shes just not it really
other than her little doll in her bed but
and we have them
do you think she prefers the books over
toys or at home
toys over books
thats really hard to say
cause shes really content in whatever
is being done at the moment
so shell
stay and do whatever shes doing for a while
and then can move and stay
so i cant really say that i
i see a preference
i think probably the toys
just cause its more practical for her to on her own
i have to be engaged in the books
you know so
i guess in that regard
and do you have any of those
i have the other ones
oh you do
-uh huh oh yes yeah
well i have but
shes more interested in
chewing on the book and moving it around
than actually engaging
in it
alright i think were done
alright good
i think shes about done
and her initials are
whats her last name
i just didnt have the sheet with me
so i i didnt know what her initials were
her initials are
i believe shes participant five two four
but im not positive
perfect and now ill just ask you
im sure that you -um
answered these same questions and some of them might be the same and some of them are probably different since hes so
-um active now he might not have been the last time
yeah definitely not like
which of the toys seemed to interest jack the most this time
and which is a good toy for
-um cause he does like other kids and stuff so
-um i mean he doesnt sit and play with it but like you know like pretend its but he likes to look at it that caught his attention
and then all this stuff like -um
hes not into stuffed animals even at home
i think the objects things that look like stuff at home like the sippy cup he picked up and
he knew what it was
you know like to drink from it and -um
i think theyre just easier to pick up really
i think the animals stuffed animals even at home he just doesnt really
he likes hard objects i dont know what that means but
which of the toys seem to interest jack the least
-um the books
an i d think its because at home the books are only for -um sleep time
maybe we should have them out all day but we dont
go to sleep so he thought he was gonna go to sleep
we needta get this cord out of here
you just wanna eat it up
just had lunch why are
isnt food
like youre hungry
food mommy has food
hey here
-um do you think that your childs interest has changed in any of the items since you were last here
no i think it kind of all stayed the same i mean last time he wasnt really interested in the books
and the stuffed animals he went for all of things he could pick and hold and look at and feel and
thats yeah and the baby and the baby
so no i dont i dont think its really changed
if you hadta pick a book even if it was at bedtime which book do you think that jack would prefer to read or look at
-um the one that you could feel the little duck on the farm the touch and feel i guess
you know what we dont have like fake food or animals hes got
-um just things that make noise toys and cars and
boys stuff
boys stuff you know what i noticed this was all very girl like i mean not that its just its even more geared to girls like food they play with f you know babies and stuffed animals
there is no like ca like stuff that he can push and that rolls
cause thats the kinda stuff that we have at home
maybe thats why he cant sit still
so do you think he prefers books or toys
which one
oh toys
does jack play with any dolls at home
no we dont have any dolls
oh no well we have a spiderman doll and yes
he does play with that
and you dont really play with pretend food or do you feed the doll do you feed the spiderman
you know what no but i think im gonna start trying to do that to see if he gets it you know
and do you think that jack recognized any of the foods from last time you were here or from home
i think like the juice
the sippy cup
id like to say he recognized the cheese cause it is ki you know
its the square kinda orange -um
and maybe thats about it i dont know if
thats probably the mo
i think cheese
cause he eats a lot of that
i dont know if he knows baby
i think he might cause
thats about it yeah
well thats it
hi having fun bch
okay so i just have a few questions for you
-um so this time which of the toys did he seem the most interested in
as usual the food
the food
any in particular
-um he really likes spoons of couse
you know what things fit in and out
so he really likes smaller things that he can put in to bigger things
but mainly if it makes noise it makes him happy
what about last time
was it pretty much the same stuff
the same yeah
first and second visit
you showing her the spoons bch
you giving her spoons bch
very nice of you to share bch
thank you bch
can you give them up bch
no yeah bch
youre not ready to give them up yet bch
almost bch
oh bch
-um which of the toys does he seem the least interested in
-um the doll
as usual
even at home he doesnt play with any of the dolls
do you bch
do you think he recognizes the words of any of these
not yet
yes bch
ah what about the animals
you dont think hes familiar
no yeah
he has the the little otter
daddy has this doesnt he bch
the otter bch
what about the other ones
ah i mean we have other variations of animals but
lets see
we have some zoo stuff
so we have the fox
we have dogs
and of course we have bears
and zebra
and the frog
we have a frog dont we bch
aha bch
we have a big frog dont we bch
-um what about books
is he interested at all
we love books
but we usually read those before nap and bedtime
and so he is just in the last couple of weeks gotten ah more attached to the touch and feel books
and then of course the ones if theres a hole in the front of the book
he loves them
so the hungry caterpillars our favorite right now because they have holes in it
do you do you own any of these books
see we have the foot book
and we have the bigger version of put me in the zoo
and we have the bigger one of good night moon
do you ever play with pretend food at home
okay do you have any of these items
-um some of the stuff exactly the same like the icecream
and plates
but ah other things just similar
we have bread pizza
dont we bch
and of course you have dolly cups and bottles bch
but we dont have anything like this do we bch
no we do not bch
lets see what else do we have
i think thats pretty much all we have for you today
yes bch
think we can go ahead and ask you some questions
did you notice anything different about what he liked today
compared to last time
yeah he liked the books even less
i dont know if its a novelty thing or if its a
hes at that age where hes discovering foods and he recognizes them
yeah i was curious about that -um are any of these things -um
foods or items that he might recognize from home or from
you know what
we dont really eat cookies and
like this might look like yogurt he does yogurt
but he
but he definitely doesnt eat meat and we very rarely eat hamburgers like
i think he recognizes it as food though like when i bring out new foods at home
he automatically knows that its food
even when its not offered to him
and so he would know yogurt but he wouldnt know icecream
hes never had that before
and hes seen us eat icecream before though
and so none of these other things either
or did you see some
he like he looked
i didnt offer him anything i offered him like the peas and he was not that interested
hes more interested in the hamburger like he grabbed it and tried to eat it versus you know like this which he looked at and then just set it down
he didnt i dont know
so i dont know if its a texture thing it feels like food
tried to drink the juice
are you being shy
you being shy
so those are the main items that he looked at was -um the ones you already mentioned
this ones for mommy
yeah the cookie is the main one
the main one okay
each time its been the cookie
is there any reason do you think he likes that one in particular
no idea
-uh it could be because of because its something he can hold in his hand
you think its the right size
i think its partially that its kind of colorful
its colorful
did you do any in and out games
like -um some kids will drop things into the pitcher
into the pitcher no not yet
is he making noise with something
i cant remember if he was
with the book he started talking with the book
im trying to think with the foods hes talking to the pitcher also
he really likes the pitcher he played with the pitcher every time weve come in too
something he was rattling
oh the -um spoons
yeah the measuring spoons where are they
oh okay
oh theyre there
he still has them
he liked those
so he likes things that he can shake like that
oh i see
and then he did pay attention to some of the books right
and first thing he did he kind of took inventory
and then he stopped and looked at the books
like he was thinking about it and then hes like no im gonna go for the food
and he kept stopping and looking at the books and hes like no theres not enough time
i gotta get to the food what are you doing
what are you doing
are you just lounging
yeah are you being silly
so does he like books
yeah because his brother does
yeah his favorite books are
like anything we have with -um
that are like really short but still have kind of
some sort of plot like if its just picture hes not as interested in it
or even if its nonsensical that has photography with babies
oh interesting
very interested in other little kids
very interested
so did he pay any attention to ours
thats why i tried to get him to play with the baby and he was not interested
he did look at her
he looked at her
the baby
play peek a boo where are you
do you guys play
peek a boo
do you guys do that kind of game at home
so hes done that before
yeah but usually he always waits for me to initiate it i think maybe because its a peek a boo book we just we just read
but normally i have to initiate it and quite often he waits for me to do the work
those things im like i see this as a pattern with both of my male children is it a
a boy thing
wait for mom to initiate it yeah
and then you can do the work
you do it
at least in my experience
oh were losing our microphone cover
and then -um i wanted to ask about the animals was he interested at all in the animals
i tried making noises with them and and he just he wouldnt even look at them
no okay
and then -um
and hes been around a few animals and hes very scared of them so i think that might be part of why hes not interested in stuffed animals yet
oh okay
i was thinking the dog which actually looks enough like the dog that we that hes had interactions with that i though he would recognize but
so he might know the name though
he might know dog and he knows
-um pictures weve done pictures and associating sounds with cows sheep ducks and horses and he seems to recognize those and anticipate those
frog too
i dont think frog yet
-um and probably not any of the more unusual animals that you have there
hi are you just kinda sleepy youre gonna put yourself to sleep
well lets see if theres anything i think that might be it
haha ha
-uh huh
there are going to be a lot of
im useta it
so what was his favorite
this genre
any in particular
mm i wouldnt say in particular
cause he kind of liked to play with
whatever is in his hands
and when he didnt like the
pea on the plate thing
but im not sure what
how to
classify that
haha hah
mhm you sharing
you dont wanna share
ha haha
that was silly
does he eat that at home
ah version of that
hes never seen actual spaghetti and noodles but
like rigatoni noodles but
easier to grab
now youre gonna do it
he definitely eats peas
okay and you said that
some of the things his
older brother might eat
do you think he recognized them
i just kind of
try to incorporate brendon
into it cause its not enough
that he seems him eat icecream
and like for the first time yesterday and
stuff like that so
do you think it hasta do anything with the shape of them
i dont know
if the shape or the color
im not sure
like the texture maybe
and yes
i definitely think the texture
cause hell like touch it and then grab it
so and
and that is a pretty cool texture
yeah it is haha ha
did you think some of
did you
do you think that
he thought some of the things were real
the bottle
definitely saw that
oh i know i felt it
and the peas
but -um
other than that -uh
i dont think so
maybe the cheese
and does he -uh
use utensils too
hes all his hands
i can put it in his hand
and hell put it aside and use his hands
hes not into that right now
all barbarian boy right now
so you
haha thats what youre saying haha
so you think he might not know what -um
no he knows
i dont think he has the patience
for it right now
or the desire
to do it
cause hell see me
and hell maybe do one time
and then
doesnt wanna do it anymore
with a fork or
mm mhm
there hasnt been much need for a spoon so far
what do you think he got out of those -uh stuffed animals
ah -um
hed like to look at them
and touch them
neither one of my kiddos really seem that into stuffed animals
yeah i guess maybe get a little bit older and know what they are before
they see a
i do not know
what about
the other items on the floor
well he was not interested in the books
i know that was different
thats a definite personality difference
he does not sit
he moves all the time
so hes definitely all boy
ha just like his older brother
and what about the dog
he actually acted like it was real
-um at first and kinda of
and then touched it and think he realized it wasnt and then
got over it
but -uh
other than that thats his
in this
these sessions are the only time hes ever
come across it so -um
if he gave much thought after he realized it wasnt a
a threat to him
so he doesnt
play with his sisters
i know
but no he you know what
honestly his toys at home are
and cars
so he likes to do that kind of stuff
roll the ball around and
those are action
things so i think he likes those
where are you going
and you used -um
-uh huh
you didnt use it as much with him
noises that the animals make
cause that didnt have the opportunity i guess
i didnt really want
do you do it
know what to call this
haha i mean its a dog but haha
do you do that with him at home
he just wasnt interested today
not today i guess
with them
and we have -um
animals at home that are
like this kinda material
that he likes to play with
and he really gets into that
a little more than the stuffed animals
i do not know if he doesnt have like a fantasy
imagination yet
to understand that they represent
but -uh he likes those little things a lot
good and what about -um
like how does he like
toys with noise
oh yes
the louder the better
and he will laugh
i mean always
i mean call it keeping the beat cause he will just
bang and hah it is so funny
yeah reese
its usually what he
goes right for
does he
play with yours
with my
the keys
oh yeah
i dont really allow that so much these days cause the teething thing
just everything goes in the mouth but yeah he likes
and hes got
a whole set of keys that are
much more involved than that one
that they play with
words of encouragement again
you used -um
you used a few of them here with him
you do the same thing where as
he does something good
they just really -um
just to help them develop
you could almost see it
you know that they become the person
theyre sposta be when you
let them know they are doing something
the right way
now do you usually say things or do you
it depends on if
if its something that is the first time ive ever seen him do it
then i clap
cause thats like a
a lot of times thats what ill
a wow really good
try that again
thats really good
and then i just
encourage him if its something hes done
i think weve asked all the questions
thank you so much
its a long
hah a long study
i really know how much you guys are doing its is -um
twice as long
as but
most but
-um i know you were just here recently
but i wanted to just ask if there have been any chances that you noticed in her interests in terms of what she wanted to play with today
compared to last time
seemed like at first the bottle and the sippycup and the baby
i dont know if thats because shes getting hungry
and she associated the bottle with herself but
-um she seemed more interested this time in the baby
-um this is what really had her going last time
texture has been a real big thing lately
is that a sippycup
oh thank you
-um different this time
didnt seem as much into animals this time
no thats not for the baby
thats for this baby
anything that pretty much bangs
she seems like she really just likes to make noise
and she definitely imitates more
ive noticed even the last couple of weeks
anything that i do she tends to wanna do it too
like when i was doing this
then she wanted to put something in it too
so she definitely likes to imitate
more than she has lately haha
so thats a new thing
-um but again we have a book very similar
and she loves opening the flaps
so i think a lot of things today she was picking up things she does at home
such as the baby doll
the bottle
the sippycup
this book
so she does have a baby doll at home
its a little bit smaller
but she has a baby doll at home that she puts in the cradle
she kind of tends rocking it and
does she feed that baby doll also
she tries to with her bottle at home yeah
-um does she play with pretend food at home
-um not as much no
so i dont know if its just something different something new that she just
i didnt notice did she play with any of the food items or kitchen items today much
yeah i mean just kind of more the banging part of it
more so than j really like putting it in something
she was putting them in here
but -um was just kind of all different things today right megan
do you think she would recognize any of the food -um from the last time or from home
any of the food items
-um not as much
i mean because we dont really have any actually any food items at home
but i mean we dont have any of these same foods
any of these
fake food items
do you think she would recognize any of these -um comp you know as real food items
i know peas dont really come like this
but they look a little like this
she still really
she has kind of food aversions
shes really only eating mainly baby food
so i dont know if shed really recognize
she would recognize these okay
shes a little young for that
yeah maybe like the cookies just from holding trying to you know take bites of baby cookies but
i think this she definitely recognized from last time haha
she likes the hair texture
which of the toys do you think or which toy is good for her personality
-um shes pretty active
so she likes to you know do the noises and haha hold things
shes pretty active pretty ah personable baby
so i think doing things that make you know sound and effect or
making people look at her haha
like doing that
which is maybe why the animals she doesnt really have as much of an interest
i see they dont do
its pretty much of her like sleeping thing at home
she sleeps with an animal but
thats really the only time she really plays with stuffed animals
do you think she prefers books or toys
-um during the day id say probably toys
i mean shes at daycare all week
its mainly you know toys
that theyre kind of playing with
although th this book she seems very fascinated by the flaps but
we do read the books at night and so
but i think during the day she mainly is with toys
haha megan
which of these toys do you think interests her the least
-um well other than this id say all the stuffed animals
i think when i put them in front of her she didnt really seem to go for them
lets see
you like this one though huh
you like that hair tickle your tummy
which of these books do you think she would most wanna look at with you
just because shes involved in it
and she can do something also
okay i think thats it
do you have anything else that you think we should know about that i didnt asked you
not that i can think offhand
im surprised she actually sat here
and now shes so mobile crawling around
she did
she does a lot of the crawling all over the place at home
so im surprised she sat here for the
so she was definitely interested
i think maybe because it was something different
i mean thats why she sat so much longer than at home
its the same old toys
so i think she gets more bored easily
she did sit the whole time
yeah shes usually crawling on everything
all over the room so
haha is that fun
you like that hair
that is fun isnt it
that seems to be your favorite toy right now
sure does
okay well i think thats all i have to ask you
you can leave that right there cause that way i dont have to write the answers to the questions
with her spoon
-um so first question is have you noticed any differences in what shes interested in playing with or the way shes playing with toys since the last time she was here
-um i think the last two times -um she showed pretty equal interest in everything and this time she pretty much ignored pile number three here
-um i kind of think that teething has trumped everything else she went straight for things that looked hard and yummy to chew on
-um and she caught a top tooth yesterday and so i just think
yeah you got some spit on you
-um i kinda think that trumped everything else in the play session today
-um but she also showed interest in the frogs so you know its it wasnt to the exclusion of other things
did she -um was she interested in any of the other animals that you got out for her
the frog and the chicken were the two that she showed the most interest in
i you know pointed out some other things but she didnt really going for it she definitely liked this frog
you too
what about the hard toys that you said she did like the best
-um did she have certain ones that were favorites today
the cookies
the two cookies she really liked -um
the smaller of the two spoons she liked
-um she spent a little bit of time with the sandwich parts -um but mostly the cookies and the spoon
and do you think she would -um recognize the names of any of these especially like the food items -um
i dont know because it looks different
i make them sandwiches with cheese and turkey but i cut them up really small so it doesnt look like that so im not im not sure that she did that
-um theyre not drinking juices yet so -um apple juice is foreign to her
so probably not right
not at least by the way they look
aha cheese yeah shes definitely heard those things bread
let us see what else
and did she look at books today
-um not really i tried to get her interested in this good night moon one but she didnt really seem like she was interested in it
let us see
-um how about toys at home does she have stuffed animals does she have a baby doll
we dont have baby dolls -um
she does have lots of stuffed animals and she does have plastic food and -um ah
oh she does okay
thats recent she got a shopping cart from grandma for christmas including plastic food
so -um so thats a new thing
we have tons of books at home -um so shes familiar with some of these things
does she have any books like the ones that we have here
-um yeah very similar yeah
weve got doctor seuss weve got the original good night moon not this particular one
are you making a mess baby
so the main difference in the way played was the teething thing and so you feel like she was chewing more
i think yeah i mean she always chews when she comes here but -um
but yeah i think that her exclusive interest in the food was because of that yeah
because of that alright
i think thats everything i needta ask you -um
and im probably gonna ask you very similar things for allison
of course yup
because thats the way it works with twins
and ill go ahead and take it out and turn it off
so i just have a few questions for you
so do you think there have been any changes since the last visit or things she plays with
-um yes she plays with this
this kitchen
these kitchen toys where before she ignored them
any in particular
any toys in the kitchen
-um she likes the measuring spoons
she liked the fake bottle
yeah i think the spoons and the bottle
so what toys out of
any of the other categories does she like the best
-um she likes this bumble bee
what do you think attracted her to it
the colors
and -uh this
spongy texture
for the hair
does she have any of these toys at home
no not these exact toys no
obviously she has bottles
and -um
the sippy cups but no not the exact toys
so do you think she was attracted to the bottle because shh
looks like a real one
because she tried to suck it
which toys do you think she likes the least
the doll
do you have any at home
no baby dolls at home
oh no we dont want the microphone
well we do want the microphone but we cant play with the microphone
are there any of the books
do you have any of those at home or
not the exact books
we have a good night moon but not that version
so what did you say she played with last time
last time she played with the bumble bee a lot
and these stuffed animals if i remember correctly
are there anything in the
that you thought she mightve recognized
in names of
or even things at home that
youve noticed that shed recognize
of toys
not really
i mean she recognizes bottle i think
but the names of toy
she probably recognizes
-uh dog
although i dont think i said the word dog
but she probably would recognize dog
cause we have a dog
but other than that no i dont think she would recognize
she may recognize the word spoon
come over here
where you going
and do you use
does she use things to eat
she tries to
its not very successful
but she does try
right here
has she started eating any of the foods here
like cookies or
but not in the
it wouldnt look like this
its all
she has waffles but theyre all broken up
so i dont know that she would even recognize
what it looked like
and cookies of course
but you
use the names in the house
we do
and everything
what are you doing
i mean she would recognize
if i took the eggo box out she would recognize what it is
she wants to play with you
she wants to play on me
do you guys
when -um
i may have missed this question
when you play at home
do you play
what do you play most with
what does she like at home
at home
right now she likes her wheely cart
where she can stand and push it
-uh and thats probably her favorite
thing right now
but we also have sort of sta
stackable cups
that break apart and go back together
and she likes those
those are probably her favorite things right now
why do you think she likes those
stackable cups
the cups
theyre rightly rainbow colored
oh i know
and they come apart so she can bang them together
and she
she likes to throw them and they roll
so its multifunctional
i think
shes agreeing
she has agreed
well great
i think weve
-uh picked apart the discussion
well enough
with what happened and everything
guess i can ask you some questions now
since youve been playing for a while
i wasnt really looking at him too much
so im not sure what he liked best
-um out of these
but these look more spread out than these so thats what im guessing
definitely -um he went for the clock again and the food stuff
and the food
excuse me
specifically these peas
i dont know why
especially those
did he like anything else -um foodwise
he liked this
was it th this one or the red one
was more -um
this one
i dont know if it was color choice or not but
and then he liked this cookie once i showed it to him
but he hasnt really had cookies yet i mean i just think maybe the multiple colors
the colors mhm
the measuring spoons he liked the way that jingled
i tried to get him interested in the stuffed animals to see
and he didnt show any interest really
you were doing the rooster i thought he would like that
but he didnt show too -um
he didnt seem to
not really
didnt spark anything with him this time
looks like hes found it again
he really likes that
yeah and i mean i havent looked for anything similar to that but
i remember last time he liked that right
he did
and then when we asked him you know when i said
wheres the clock
h he went toward it
but this time he didnt seem to really register the way it did the first time
was that the main thing that he liked last time
im trying to remember
he just stayed with that for the longest time
and now hes found
oh look it hes trying a lot of things huh
and he likes to just pick things up and throw them to see how they sound when they land like that
you know these things are heavier
and i could see that he was like
that made a different thud instead of the the peas that were so light
so do you think he likes them for that reason
so ju different things theyre different weights and they sound different
i think thats what he likes to experiment with is yeah
just seeing how they
what gravity does huh
like what happens when i do this right
did he try any of the books today
he didnt
i got the out
and he didnt seem to even recognize what i was trying to read
oh i know you tried with
i tried the kangaroo
thats it
and the chicken or rooster
no interest there
he didnt like pitcher until i put something in there
it made a sound
made a sound
that was
so he didnt
that that he liked
and but he you know when he got it out then he didnt want the pitcher anymore
he didnt wanna try to put it back in like
sometimes he might
balance out huh
it does
you found the clock again i know
-um lets see
or at home maybe -um if youre reading a book with him
would he rather turn the pages himself or does he like you to to sort of do that
he wants to hold the book
he wants to hold it okay
what i found yesterday was that the best thing was for him to be in his highchair haha
to try to read because otherwise hes grabbing it
and depending on you know these books are fine but the thinner ones he would just be tearing at this point so
but he wants to be
he wants to be in control of that
and would you say he likes toys better at this point than books
definitely mhm
-um does he play with any dolls at home
he hasnt
and my daughter has a lot
but hes gone toward her favorite doll a few times but i think its only because she plays with it so much
i dont really think
its not so much that its a doll
right i mean out of all these dolls he didnt go for that
he wanted to play with this dolls eyes a little bit
and touch the mouth and the nose
but i dont think he was really
i dont think dolls are his interest area now
-um so would you say that i know its not the food toys but the animals or the books interested him the least this visit
which one was sort of least interesting
-um i would say the books would be the least interesting this time
i mean it seemed like i sparked a little bit of interest with the puppet and the r chicken but not
and the books i mean i may as well have not been saying anything
didnt seem to do anything with those
and which kinds of toys do you think are good for his personality
the stuff that has an effect like when hes shaking the the -um teaspoons or the measuring spoons
he can hear a reaction
so -um at home theres a little play piano
so i mean hes not playing it
but he likes to pound on it because he knows that it makes a sound
-um i dont know
does he have any of those toys that -um you push a button and something pops up
he likes those
theres a
so cause and effect
cause and effect kinda thing
you press a button and plays music
its something that you can hang on the side of a crib
but we dont use it for that
-um but theres a little -um dial that you can turn
and like these two gears turn
so he likes to see that happen
-um yeah push and pull kinda stuff
anything that he can hit to make a sound or
fair enough huh
yeah and our play kitchens in the basement
but he would be all over this stuff too if he could just
whatever he can shake and
whatevers making noise
move or press buttons
pounds things together all the time
because he was trying to do that with something there
-um and it didnt make much of a noise
i think it was the two peas
it was like the peas and something
and it didnt really do anything for him because it didnt make a noise
right so you skipped that and went on to something else huh
do you think he recognizes the names or any of the like food items or the utensils or any of the animal names yet
no -um you know i filled out that form and i said you know i dont know if hes sposta know any of this stuff but he doesnt
i mean we
no theyre so variable at this age their interests what -um
theres nothing that hes sposta be doing that we have here
its just sort of looking at what he wants
of interest
yeah i like last time we we said like
lucas find the clock
because he seemed to know the name of it then
but yeah
and i think there are random things
like i think he knows milk now but not any of the
i i dont think i could say to him you know
get the book
or get the
-um i think the reason we may be asking that is just that if he did know some of the names and you said the name would he be more likely to go get that than if he didnt recognize any of those names and was just playing so you know
no sweetie
its just interesting to look at patterns that way
he likes chords
-um so have you noticed any changes in the toys that shes been playing with here
since last week
no not not really
-um probably since last week i have tried to be more purposeful at home
because its it like made me aware that shes shes not doing too much like pretend play yet
but -um but you know she just kinda explores stuff
rather than doing too much meaningful play situations
can i have those
oh two thank you
she has been giving me stuff more lately
and -um she definitely gets angrier when shes not allowed to do what she wants
whether it be with a toy or not
-um so out of the toys that we have here which ones do you think she was most interested in
-um the clock
i could see that
-um what about the food items
do you think she liked those
-um mhm
yeah i think she likes plastic toys a lot
you know -um ones that she can put in her mouth
yeah i see her eating a lot
-um ones that make noise
yeah yummy
-um shes definitely not really too into stuffed animals or or dolls at home really either
-um you know brief brief interactions at best
okay -um i noticed that you were trying to read a book
-um is that something you do at home
mhm but i i really only have success if its like before she falls asleep and were in like a rocking chair and theres no other toys around
shes shes not really into them when theres other options going on
thats mommys
-um do you have any similar books at home
-um we dont have any of these specific books
like we have some of this series and we have a couple board books
the books she likes the best when she does like books are the ones that have the sensory -um piece to them
and like we have her books but not this specific book
and i pretty much only do like li lift the flap or -um the touch and feel books with her
those are the ones she has the most attention for
do you think there are any items here that she would recognize the names of
maybe cup
i i i kinda thought she would recognize the bottle
so i thought she might know bottle
-um and spoon
but pretty much the
and and cookie
are the ones that i would think she would r re identify most easily but im not sure she would
-um well shh we were here last week
and i think they were all the same
i think
oh yeah definitely
mhm like we dont have that whole sandwich kit
our pizza is different
icecream she doesnt see in real life
or war toys
-um so yeah
this stuff here is different yeah
do you have pretend food at home
mhm yeah
and she likes it
-um she likes best to like take it
we have a little kitchen
she likes best to see whats in the pot and dump it all out
you know shes still like into dumping
okay -um is there anything else youd like to tell us about her playing
at here or at home
-um nothing really too new
shh she really wants -um someone to play with her a lot of the times now
and thats pretty new in the past few months
and if her sister is playing somewhere in the same room shell go there
no matter what shes playing with thats where she wants to be
so i think shes looking for you know interaction more
she has been mouthing less since she started walking about a month ago
-um but with new things
and with things she knows that are typically mouthed
she puts it right in her mouth
youre so funny
is that good
alright well then i think were all done here
ready to go
dont with
what we need from you guys
that was just
so i can just ask you a few questions
i know you wanna
get her changed
haha ha
i think at one point she was
a little distracted cause she was
ha hah
well what did you was
her favorite
items or types of items today
i would have to say the cookies
ha since she
has been holding them the entire time
and or trying to eat them
and do you think she recognizes
that as a food that shes seen before
ah no
i dont think she recognizes any of the foods yet because
shes eating foods like this
but we usually just give her
you know well give her five or six small pieces at once
so she doesnt necessarily see the full
the full
you know shell have pizza but itll be you know a few little bites of pizza not the full slice
and so
do you think she just likes
im not sure if it was the colors or
they dont
i dont think they look like toys she has
so i dont know what it is about the cookies
that she likes in particular
i see that shes wanted to hang onto them
yeah haha
so did you think that she liked anything else
besides the cookies today
i was sorta surprised she loves books with flaps
and she didnt seem very interested
so i think the cookies kind of
for some reason
were such a focus
but usually she loves books like this
so she does have books at home
oh yeah
yeah the peekaboo books are her favorite
and she has
not this one but
i do not know its by the same author
but -um
she likes
she likes those so
weve got some
weve got a book over there
that has some textures does she have any like that or
her peekaboo books all have textures in it and she
she sleeps with a couple of them
and when
you know she wakes up in the morning
shell play with them
and ill come in and all the pages are open
and shes been you know
she knows right where to go on the page
to touch the texture and
does she have any -um baby dolls
does she have stuffed animals
has a few that are favorites -um
shes got a dog
that she sleeps with every night
and theres a couple of rabbits
that are sort of her cuddly animals
i noticed you were
showing her some of them
i dont remember which ones but
do you
do you guys
do you go through animal things with her
names of animals or sounds or things like that
i try to stick with the ones that make noises i know haha
ha ones that i went i dont know what noise this makes
but i could tell you what its called
but its not gonna be as interesting haha ha
yeah we have some odd ones in here dont we
haha ha
like i know this is a deer
but what sound do deer make
pick it up
you dropped a cookie
heres your cookie
heres the cookie
here it is
ha good job
and she did just learn earlier this week so big
which is why she sometimes just does it
cause she wants to hear
so big and
get that response
so big
one day
she just went around the living room
she just kept going like this
so then youd have to keep
she looks like she likes this chair
doesnt have any kid chairs at home
she useta at daycare and she loved it
-um i just havent gotten one for her yet
now youre talking
youre talking
lets see
do you think she
you said she probably wouldnt recognize any of the food items
as food items
would she recognize any of the names of food items
mm no
the only thing she knows
she knows the concept of being hungry and
she asks for more but i think that she thinks it just means food
and she
asks for milk
with sign language those are the only two shes doing right now
you know and yesterday i wasnt sure if she just
thought she always hadta show more when she was eating
but yesterday she was eating
i was giving her fruit
i was eating some
and she was eating some and i had a bunch cut up ready to give her
and i one point i said do you want more
and she kinda looked at me and turned around and started playing
she wasnt just doing it in a response to me always saying it
i think shes started to figure out
if i dont want more i dont say it and i haha
you know
i dont get it
yeah okay
you feel like youre starting to to pair the meanings with
out of these things here -um
what do you think she liked the least this visit
everything but the cookies
and do you
feel like
the way shes played
or the things that shes played with today are different than the last time you here
she usually goes for the food
i think because just
and she likes to put plastic toys in her mouth
oh now you have the peas
you had peas for lunch amelia
you liked them
they were yummy
so i think usually she goes for the food
and ill try
i always try
bring in books and read to her
sometimes shes playing
and im reading a book
and shes not really paying any attention but
but i figure
you know even if she just hears it
right theres no harm
and does she have any
favorite toys at home that arent here
she has a set of stacking cups that she really likes
and -um
like a sorting thing
she usually loves the peekaboo books
and shell
theres a couple other books she likes too
i think ones like babys first words
and its kinda got a soft cover
and i dont know if its the cover that she likes or
the images are all -um
theyre actual photographs
instead of
you know
drawn things and she
and actually now that i think about it the peekaboo books are photographs too
so i do not know if she prefers photograph books to other things
thats interesting
what else do you like to play with at home
a few moms have said
oh you dont have it here but my child loves balls for instance
i mean
we dont have a lot of balls really the only balls we have around the house are
the tennis balls for the dogs
and she doesnt really seem to have much interest in them
does she like
the dogs
-um sometimes shell ignore them sometimes she plays with them
or she tries to
she loves to feed them
she thinks thats really funny
and she sometimes likes their bones haha
but a lot of times they see her coming and theyre like
im out of here
haha ha
ha thats that kid again
oh theyre
theyre smart
i remember that stage
kids were that her age
so lets see
that might be
does she have any dishes and
and play food at home
not yet
i think
alright so
i think weve asked you this before but
in case we havent
what toys do you think are the best ones for her
or why do you think certain toys interest her
she likes the feel of the plastic
to chew on
also because they are a little bit smaller
these are a little bit bigger right
you know for her
hands and so these are easier to
to pick up
does she like toys that make noise
not so much
nah i mean
we dont really have any toys that require batteries
when she sees them
yeah the banging
we have some
musical toys -um
because we have a tambourine and some other things and
sometimes shell play with them
but i think i like them more than she does haha ha
and i bought her one of the little
pianos you know just has the four notes
and you press the buttons and every time
oh amelia come look
and ill play it and shell look at it
and then shell just turn it over
haha like okay
this was a bust haha
at least for now
im sure as she gets older
right for it would be more interesting
its not so compeling
yeah no
i think thats all
oh but she has a maraca she loves
we didnt tell about that
a maraca
its got a nice handle and you just shake it
you shake your maraca right
makes a nice noise
well is there anything else that we should know that i didnt ask you
i dont think so
what do you think amelia
well thank you though
so were gonna see you when youre two
another year
so is it okay for people to
for other labs or our lab to call you if theres studies in the meantime that shes the right age
so well leave you as
its okay to contact
well call you
-um well ahead of her
visit to set something up
here you go kiddo
careful whee
you mind if i start asking you some questions
okay what do you think -um she liked to play with the most
i think she loves noise makers
and -uh yeah she seems to be really into the spoon which looks a lot like the kinda spoon she would eat from so that doesnt really surprise me
-um and yeah she just likes to make little noises
and pick things up and see if they make soft sounds or loud sounds
shell experiment with that stuff at home so
thats not surprising is it
is it similar to what she played with last time
it i cant remember exactly what she played with last time
i know last time she liked the measuring spoons
-um but she always seems to gravitate toward the kinda food lou louder harder kinda toys and stuff
this was funny to me because since weve been here last she drinks more out of a sippy cup
so you know this i know this is a sippy cup but i wouldnt necessarily think thered be enough things that would make her think oh i should do this and put this in my mouth
and we dont drink anything bright orange for instance we dont have a little tiny thing
hers all have little handles and the spouts different
but it was interesting to me that she understood thats a mini sippy cup and im going to put it in my mouth and see if anything comes out
so thats kinda funny to me
was there something that you tried to play with her that she was absolutely not interested in
the books
you know she seemed like she had enough going on that she didnt really care about the books
and like this stuff was interesting but only in so much as can i make it make a noise when i hit it with a spoon
and if i cant okay then im moving back to my loud toys
so i think that she was kind of again gravitating toward the the food plastic kind of clanky sounding stuff
what were some of the animal names that are familiar to her
-um dog
certainly dog maybe not poodle
but dog
-um we do talk about a goose but not that much
-um the ones shes really familiar with actually arent really here
like we talk more about kind of the farm animal stuff
like the animals that would be in here she hears about a lot
she hears frog
what were the animals in that book that
definitely like -uh duck lamb or sheep horse cow a lot of and pig
i mean pretty much all these sort of farm animals are ones that she hears a lot
she has like a little play farm and then she has books that have the farm animals and we have a puzzle thats a farm puzzle
so it seems like we just have a lot of stuff that lends itself to being talked about
so she hears the sounds and we make the sounds and she plays with the different things
what is that bch
and at home -um -um does she prefer toys over books as well
its funny itll just kinda depend
-um she she definitely likes being read to
and we build that into her day
but i think she would prefer to be on the move right now
so reading is kinda like were reading to her and shes playing
and then reading is like before a nap or before bed
you know shes more willing to sit on our laps and and read for a while
and then sometimes you know shell be cuddled up and kinda quieter and we can read for a long time
so it it totally depends but mostly if shes in play mode books are not gonna do it for her
shes gonna wanna be like moving
does she like certain books over other books
like she normally will like things like this that have flaps and shell do the flaps after i do them
like some of the books we have at home while were reading it shell do this and then shell turn the page herself
-um shes not into long stories
i mean what you would kind of expect
faces real faces real pictures seem to be something shes more into
and then we have these helen oxberry books this like set of four books that are just really sweet really simple and they are all you know illustrated theyre not pictures
but its just real simple messages and theyre big baby faces that are doing things like clapping or tickling or theres a good night book
and she likes that
shell sit and look for a long time which
when we first got these books like they have a total of like eight words in the whole book
and im like how is this a book
how is my kid gonna like this
i dont like this
and its actually its some of our favorite stuff to do
because it really just kind of cuts it down to the simple you know like up down up in the sky
you know swing low swing high
bumpity hold on tight
hush little baby say good night
and thats the whole book
but its like she loves it and so we love it
she is just looking at you
yeah i know like hey i know that
she likes her goodnight moon
we read that
so just nothing thats like long or like we really havent gotten into doctor seuss she doesnt seem to like as much yet
thats too a little bit longer
longer story and maybe just not as interesting for her to connect with or something i do not know
what are some of the foods that might be familiar to her
-um in that you played with or
well definitely cheese
we you know will have a snack of like pieces of of a slice of cheese
-um the peas
-uh certainly bread you know
little pieces of bread
or waffle
probably not so much icecream we dont really eat that at home
she doesnt really see that
pizza maybe
-um and i have no idea what some of these things are so
i wouldnt be really familiar
but we dont do a lot of desserts
so nothing desserty
yeah bch
but certainly in the last couple months you know we eat a lot more solid foods and baby foods now
how about juices
no juice but we do -uh water in the sippy cup and milk
-um so she would be familiar with probably those kind of drinks
but nothing like that looks co like it has color to it
that would probably just look like something funny
im sure youd figure out to try to drink it because it was liquid bch
yeah bch
yeah bch
how about -um babydolls
does she have dolls at home or how did she fare with this babydoll here
she that baby doll doesnt really look anything like what she has she has kinda soft babies
-um a couple of them are sposta look human
one is like a funny yarn flower kind of doll
we have more stuffed animals now in the crib because we found that shes more into them
-um and she has like a big bunny thats really funny that has different sensory kind of noises it makes and things it can do and she will kiss that and hug that and like talk to that and the same thing with this little like one hundred and one dalmatian doll thats at our house
that she really gets into
but not so much anything that looks like a real baby i dont think she gets that as much yet
its just like a soft cuddly little thing at this point
are you doing like body parts and
yes we weve done that -um weve got some books that have that we have some rhymes we do and then we do were doing more like the songs
like han you know head shoulders knees and toes
were doing that more
we have these little rhymes that we do with her
so were doing body parts more and i dont know if im just projecting on her that shes getting it more but like if ill say wheres the bunnys ears and she grabs the ears i just assume thats real you know
whereas really it could just be that she likes the ears because they make a good sound
but shes definitely like in the last month ive noticed a real growth spurt in terms of what she understands what she seems to be following and doing and what she associates with like the sound of the front door opening even if were upstairs shell immediately start crawling because she knows somebodys either coming or going
and before she didnt really seem to connect that as much
and -uh if we say wheres mommy wheres daddy you know shell look for us
she says now
she says which sometimes means i think im sleepy night and sometimes i think means im hungry because she associates being fed with like sleep
so shes starting to -um do more labeling but definitely more you know understanding of language and i think some of that if im like youre pulling on mommys hair shell laugh and kind of pull more
so i think shes kind of getting some of that
i do not know
maybe im just projecting
but she certainly is just like in front of my eyes seems more aware of things that are going on
its harder to trick her or get something past her
you know like if she sees something she wants and before she even gets there if i have like real quickly put it away it useta be that she would just kind be like oh thats weird i thought i knew that was there
now she looks at me and just knows
i saw that
and shell start crawling around behind me until she finds it
and then shes like yeah i know
i knew that was there
dont even try to pull that past me anymore
so like the blackberry the remote controls the phones in the house
those are all really hard to sneak away anymore if she sees it its like over
yeah bch
but its funny because i filled out that paper work
and and we have a nanny whos home with her like three to four days a week
and so i like to you know partner with her on this stuff
and i want her to feel a vested interest in rosies development and language and all this stuff
so i always leave the paperwork with her and im like hey lets talk about this when when i get home
like tell me if you agree or disagree with anything i put
so you know the first time she was kind of like didnt really do it
the second time she was like i think she does this and im like okay and then we you know we looked at or whatever
and then the next day i said hey theres some things i didnt fill out why dont you try these with her and see if she likes them like putting a cheerio in the bottle and see if shell go for it
and so she got really excited about it
the nanny was like this is cool
so she was doing it and talking to me
so this time i said okay heres all the paperwork let me know and when i got home shes like you totally underestimate your daughter
shes like there is so much on here that she knows and does and im like really
shes like yes
she knows her stroller she knows diaper she knows
im like she does
shes like yeah i mean abby shes like every single day i say to the kids okay were gonna go to the stroller and they crawl to the top
and shes like now maybe theyre just associating that with leaving but they know stroller means something
and if i hand rosie you know if i say diaper shell crawl over to me
or if she thinks im gonna change it shell run away but she gets it
so it was so funny because i was like oh okay
so we went through this and and the nanny was so proud of herself because she was like right
rosie does know a lot more than i have associated her with knowing
so that was like both humbling like hm your nanny hasta tell you about your kid
but it was also a good reminder that sometimes i think were so useta what they dont know
that we dont pick up the clues when they get it
so thats kinda been a a mommy epiphany i think
well you also said that you -um you werent sure you were projecting on her so you never know we use this all the time i dont know if she knows the word or knows the routine you know so
right exactly
-uh its hard
so its certainly shes picking things up and shes getting that figured out
i sometimes worry because the other little boy in the nanny share is fifteen months
and he doesnt really have any language yet
-um and you know were a good four months behind him but shes not around a a kid whos like talking to her or engaging with her
and so thats why we really stress that we want the grownups who are around her to be creating a really language rich environment
because you know the the little boy i mean the parents are kinda worried about it and they might start doing just like looking into if theres anything cognitive there they needta be thinking about but
hes so advanced motor skills wise that i dont think they really worry about it
and then all the sudden its like okay but hes still not saying anything okay but hes still saying anything and
well see
-um they can get you know checked out -uh see what they say through the infants and toddlers program in their county
were in i dont even know if we have one
i feel like is kind of
i do not know either
but but theyre both doctors so i think theyve theyve looked into what kinda like first steps kinda thing would be around that they could look at
he could just be a late talker
you know
all of the sudden hell string a phrase together
i know
well that would be really cool
she is doing more like signs which is kinda fun
like shell do more
and shell do milk
yeah bch
oh bch
when she was sick she like went on a food strike for fifteen hours like she wouldnt eat she wouldnt
and i was kind of like worried about it and we were getting ready to go to the doctor just to check it out
and she was crying and she did the milk sign and i was like youre telling mommy that you do wanna eat now youre hungry
yeah bch
and she came right over and she nursed and i was like oh my god this is a language breakthrough
rosie just told me what she wanted with out more than crying
just like the first year it seems like its just crying and you determine the cry
whats in there bch
is that the horsie bch
do you feel the horsie bch
is that the lamb bch
like year right or something
a year
is it at two years that we come back
well call at twenty three months
two years old
and then we try to set something up -um by two years
and that evaluation we just started our first round of those
whats that like
whats that procedure
-um its lengthy
its about three hours
and then -um we -um do like a series of standardized testing
and -um but it looks fun
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
its not its not the
it looks fun for them and theres snack time and bathroom breaks and stuff like that
-um and yeah so every every kids been kind of performing differently
-um so we have so far we have one graduate clinician that is running it
-um so like ill ill have to be trained on it and things like that
so hopefully yeah ill be here this time next year so maybe ill be the one
thats so wild
like what will she be like
i do not know its gonna be crazy
but i mean a year has already gone so fast that i know the next one will be a blink of an eye too
well cool
well thatll be fun baby bch
thank you so much
oh were gonna leave that on
oh im sorry right
im sorry
he still likes these silly food things
do you have those at home
so probably this is the only place he sees those silly food bits
we do have -um
he went to the -um little bee guy
because hes s recently been playing with a purple thing that has the same texture as is the bees head
so he thinks
my shoes
oh hes gonna eat your shoes yeah
he thinks thats pretty wild
he loves the texture of them
what other stuffed animals did you think he
well he liked the froggie
hes got two stuffed froggies at home
he likes to pull on hair too
so he liked the froggie
do you think
oh he liked this because i think he was interested in either the eyes or the fact that he could maybe get them off
he liked that too
-um do you think hed prefer to play with the books or the toys
at home he likes to play with books
he likes
i didnt get to your peekaboo book
but he enjoys the peekaboo books and like the touch and feel books
-um i think the common thread still is things that he can chew on
these things he chews
he likes to chew
do you think he has a preference for like which ones of those
-um no he seemed to like the
i mean hes leaning towards the waffles
but last time he liked the burger
this time he still ate the burger too
the pizza
the pizza i think was good because he could get to his molars that i think are coming in
haha thats convenient
yeah mostly the he still likes the chewable things
yeah silly boy
arent you a ham
okay well i think were good then
i felt so silly after last time i left that i hadnt offered him a doll
like im like you know indepe well not ind whatever
but you know
whats the word
you know i got a degree
i got stuff
im empowered woman
didnt even occur to h me to give him a doll
so i went home and told my husband
we needta get him a doll
thats great
doesnt really like to play with it
he pokes it in the eyes a little bit
but hes got one so
well because i was like
he should
he should have one
so now hes got one
you like that waffle
thats a winner
so thats it i guess
thats good
well thank you for coming in
and now we wont see him again until hes almost two
i know thats crazy
hell be by then
i guess they all will be right
when it gets closer to then well schedule an appointment
and in the meanwhile
oh i didnt listen to the thing
oh well
oh im sorry
i can play it for you if youd like
is it too inconvenient
im just curious
-um i was gonna say
do you wanna be contacted for other studies in between
youve been coming here so often we try to keep him as -um as our own
but now that its a whole year we can kind of let the others
share the wealth
sure yeah i think he has fun coming here
if you dont mind id like to ask some questions
not gonna be writing anything down because were taping
right okay
so -um
what do you think he enjoyed the most
the icecream cone probably
its good to put in his mouth and to chew on isnt it
theyre very familiar
i mean th the juice and the sippycups
do you think he recognizes the
oh yeah that its a yeah i mean definitely
he wasnt getting anything out of it but he certainly recognizes that it was something to drink
were there any other toys that you thought
that he liked or
that he liked or preferred of the other toys
i think he had fun with the food toys we dont -um
what else
the i mean it seemed evident that the icecream cone was a hit
what else did he like to play with
th the blocks these little things when we made a little tower that seemed like it was good fun
and -um
i think thats probably maybe the baby he likes to look at babies and point to their features and
didnt seem that interested in the book but we have a similar karen katz book that hes that he likes to look at the babies in so the doll
do you have dolls at home
we have -um one little doll he doesnt give a whole lot of attention to
its -um but -um but books with babys in it
and he has a big brother that he plays with all the time so
and the books -um does he prefer books over toys
i dont think so i think generally toys over books now at this point
so hes -um
and it doesnt have to be a you know he doesnt obviously use the toy in the intended way at this point anyway generally
but -um any things toys measuring spoons
rocks you know
do you think he recognized the activity of that book that you read him
-um probably i mean we do peekaboo so
yeah and we have like i said i think we have a peekaboo karen katz book
not that book but i lift the flap something
-um so i think so right william wills
what are you doing
what do you see
felt that he was not
not terribly interested in
-um not in particular i think hed be interested in anything
theres a lot of toys here
so i think when
i j i often find you know if theres just one toy he would be you know if i were interacting with him with it he would probably be a lot more interested but theres a lot of toys here so
i think -um any toy i think here he would probably interested in if there werent other things to
to distract him from do you know what i mean
and the animals toys did you use any of the
not really i think i grabbed a little poodle at the end
but he doesnt hes not terribly interested in the animal toys
i mean we have some stuffed animals but hes never taken like a special a special little you know stuffed animal to bed or hes not attached to anything like that
you mentioned you had the doll
we have one doll it doesnt look anything like that i would say its a soft doll with a flat face thats much more realistic
but yes we do have a -um my mother gave my first son a doll when he was born so we have that doll kicking around
are there any other toys here that you also have at home or
not the particular books we have good night moon
like i said we have a karen katz book
and we have measuring spoons in the kitchen and sippycups for sure
but other than that we dont have any other toy plates or food or things like that
we have keys right
okay so
i think thats pretty much it
answered all the questions
do you have any questions
what is this i mean what is general
who do parents are you do you videotape other moms or dads playing with their children how do they im just curious like i you know what how other people play or how
i mean its just i guess it varies quite a
i think i think -um
its probably a different setting for everybody
at home
right sure its different how the children would
-um its hard to tell
somebody just you know
im not paying attention when i read because i want people to feel comfortable but
usually i mean its normal of what they do play they with -uh i guess every kid is interested in a different toy
you know
so the -um
the tower building and
things like that usually
parents only go first for the animal
-uh huh
you all done with your with your bottle there wills
okay we gotta say bye to miss sabrina oh weve been still videotaping
thats okay
so what did you notice was different from last time
well different
which toys did
okay we didnt do the peekaboo book before
and we didnt really use the pitcher for banging
he always comes back to these cylinder kind of things
but that was the first time he banged it on the the pitcher to get the noises
he was always banging them together before
-um never picked up the cookie before or the icecream
and otherwise i think he went to the same things pretty much
more or less
so what items do you like the best
that was a definite good one and he liked the peekaboo book for a little while
do you have that book at home
do you have anything like it
actually we dont and we
played peekaboo a little differently at home
we like cover him up with a little towel and he pulls them off himself and does peekaboo but
no we dont have anything like that
do you play any other games like peekaboo with him and stuff
we try and play peekaboo we try and play -um you know so big and
and pattycake but so far he really hasnt i mean he thinks theyre funny
but he wont actually play along
what do you doing bud
-um but yeah he laughs during them
which items do you think he liked the least
the least
he never seems interested in the plush animals
wait what did you do to your head
oh my goodness
-um he wasnt really interested in anything unless it made noise
he didnt seem very interested in this one when i tried to give it to him
does he -uh play with toys that make a lot of noise at home
he does he does
he either makes the noise with blocks
we have blocks and those little shapes that go into things
so he makes the noise that way or we have toys that you know are electronic and have sing songs
song songs or the alphabet
so -um do you have food items at home
we do not
im thinking we might needta because he wont eat food
he wont pick up food and put anything in his mouth so the
fact that he put that cookie in his mouth was actually kind of big because
he doesnt let us put anything in his mouth
besides baby food
like any pops or cheerios or anything like that he wont have anything to do with it
until he figures out how delicious they are
i know
thats why i dont wanna give him something sweet or thats all im ever gonna get out of him
right bud
but yeah we dont have any food items at home
do you have any of the same books
-um we have good night moon
-uh we have something similar to this one
i dont know if its this one its a little bit different but its similar to this one
and thats it
so you said a lot of the names of the objects would he recognize any of those names at home
no we havent been able to figure out if he knows any yet
but -um yeah i mean we tend to name them when were playing with them
but especially we dont have any of these things at home im sure he doesnt know any of the names
are you gonna stand up on your own
do that on video that would be cool
so -um the toys that he chose do you think they match his personality
like making the noise and -uh cylinder
yeah he likes things that he can really grab and things that he can bang together to make nosie
or things that he can you know like this that he likes to turn them around and see what they are
so yeah and he kinda pushed away the ones that were kind of just plain and werent gonna make a whole lot of noise
or wouldnt fit in his hand well either i guess that would be the other thing he likes to be able to hold it and turn it around
you know
-um pasta weve tried pasta
-um bread
cheese little bits of meat
-um cheerio type things
-um some vegetables
little bit of everything
so far nothing
occasionally we can sneak some in but -um weve been told its kind of a texture thing he doesnt like the texture of it
what you doing
go get that
no baby dolls are at home or
we have a lot of animals
a lot of -um we have a few stuffed animals the only ones hes really been interested in has actually been a rather large panda bear
-um and we do have a little bear that hes a little bit interested in
but in general hes right now his biggest thing at home is he
and he didnt do it here which
surprises me he takes whatever he can like a box or you know we have this little remote thing that says numbers
and he pushes it around like a truck
which he did not do here but that actually is kind of a normal thing hell take whatever he can and try and push it around
and then we
we have a cat who is extremely tolerant that has also kind of become his toy
what are you doing
oh so none of
the animal names here today even though well i guess he didnt play with them
do you think he would be familiar with any of it
i dont
i dont think hed be familiar with any of them
we do like with the books we do noi -uh animal sounds
but i dont see any recognition that he knows
what animal it is
but like hey rydan what does the cow say
the cow says
usually he laughs when we do the noises i mean my husband and i were talking about it and he might recognize -um something physical we do like
when we ask him to come here we might be in another room and tell him to come here and maybe the tone of our voice or something like that he recognizes but we dont think he actually recognizes the terms yet
anyway what are you doing
do you -um say any like words of encouragement like good job or
aha usually
especially when he does something new we tend i guess to do it more when he does it the first time than
after that but -uh most of his play is pretty physical
so he tends to wanna stand and roam around
he get gets the you know the -uh bowls out and the lids from the kitchen and bang on those
what are you doing
there it goes
where you going
ice cream
-uh huh
youre gonna go help arent you
are you
do you like papers bch
i should have like a pretend record form
for them to tear apart
here you want the book its kind of like it bch
hi bch
oh your up you wanna get oh look at that
a pink one bch
thats a dog bch
-uh huh bch
mhm bch
hes pretty friendly huh
he goes to anybody
that is so sweet
well what do you think about how hes playing with the toys and what hes interested in compared to last time you were here
-um hes
any differences
less interested in the stuffed animals this time till the very end there -um last time he was kind of equally interested i think
-um and then the -um he likes the books more it seems this time
but hes been reading a lot more books at home lately
in you know his spare time
so he -uh looked like maybe he would like to turn pages
yeah thats something in the last couple weeks hes started doing
hell pick up a book and starting flipping through and just looking at the pages
right bch
right bch
so he did like some of those then
yeah the one withs with m s the -uh the touchy feely stuff and yeah
he likes those and then the lift flap books
okay -uh
i think
then he likes this stuff the hard toys in the middle
and do you think thats why he likes them
i think there hard and there something he can pick up and bang together and -uh
and knock down stacks that mommy makes
come back here your quick bch
arent you quick come here bch
mommy wants you she does bch
come here can you walk to me bch
wow almost bch
not in these shoes its the shoes that are killing him
i know
the hard stuff he played with the most
okay were there any items that he tended to like
the peas he always like the peas
alright and anything else that he liked in particular
-um the ice creams and the peas but i dont know if its for color or familiarity or
if its familiar
has he had anything like pizza
yeah well hes had some bites of it but most of his are cut up
so they dont look like this
they dont look like this
the peas are probably the one thing that look like what hes useta getting
but look you have it now
of course now you want the pizza bch
and the cookie he likes the cookie
so besides cut up pizza and peas has he tasted any of these other
-um yeah the cookies the waffle -um
hamburger i mean hes had a lot of the lunch meat and stuff
weve had spaghetti
youre gonna pizza on spaghetti bch
thank you bch
youre a good sharer bch
well switch bch
there you go bch
-um and the any of the -um plates and the non food things
he eats off his tray right now so plates go flying right so we dont mess with plates
right bch
and he did like that
the pitcher he likes to put things in and out
so it was less the pitcher as a function and more pitcher as a place to put things
that sounds right huh bch
-um and then did he recognize the bottle or sippy cup as something that you think he wouldve
he didnt seem too
are there any of the food items do you think hes -um would recognize the names of
probably not
and then lets see oh animals -um would he recognize the names of any of the animals
-um maybe doggie
-um the doggie
doggie and kittie are the only ones we really do a lot of at home so
there must be a book over there with farm animals
that was this one the feeling yeah
oh yeah mhm
and do you think he would recognize any of those
-uh probably not
or the names of either the pictures of them or the names
weve told him the names of them in books and stuff like that i dont know if he would -uh you know directly recognize
if they mhm
familiarity -um hes heard them but maybe not a lot
yeah exactly
like i said doggie kittie and probably bird turtle things that he sees at friends houses and stuff like that we probably see the most
-um and then was he interested in any of the unusual animals that we have here
that he probably would not have seen at a friends house
-um it didnt seem that way but
of course i mean this is not exactly
hes kind of unusual he has a hat on
not too many animals you see like that
-um alright and then oh im sure other people have asked you this before but i dont think i have anyway i dont remember
if you have any toys like these at home or at daycare if hes in daycare
-um hes not in daycare
we have books we have stuffed animals no fake food -um but lots of blocks and stuff he likes to stack
he seemed to like that right
the knocking down
yes he loves making stacks and knocking them down
thank you for the hug that was very sweet bch
oh good kisses and hugs youre such a lovey bch
thank you bch
okay and so you told me what seemed different from last time
is he -um playing with things differently than maybe last time
-um a lot more of the in and out
thank you baby bch
-um a lot more of the flipping of the pages in the books
-um thats about it thats probably the biggest change in the last month is the you know just doing the more of the in and out
so in and out of containers
youre lovey today what do you want bch
yeah hes a nice boy is he tired
-uh yeah he does do that a lot but if he wants something hell pretend like he loves you
he does it to daddy all the time
does that already bch
oh my goodness
hell give daddy a hug to get closer to something
well yeah pretty smart boy huh bch
he says i like to think so bch
peas and spaghetti
peas and spaghetti
but it is lunchtime so that
i think i -um
you want them back bch
did he look at the babydoll at all
he looked at her briefly he played with her more last time than this time -um
bring it over here silly boy bch
oh hi bch
there we go bch
where you going you gonna try to walk again bch
hi bch
so he looked at her more last time
yeah i mean he looked at her and kinda just acknowledged her he doesnt you know wanna play with her
do you have any baby dolls at home
no we dont
i think thats all
no babies bch
i think thats it
im gonna go ahead and turn this stuff off
he wont be back till hes two
oh no
-um at least not for this study i should say
we have
playing and stuff
thanks luc
do you think anythings changed since the
last time that you guys came in
-um no actually
she picked the same toys
what kinds of things was she most interested in
all the food
so yeah last time we came in she wanted all the food toys
she wanted the food toys again so
does she play with those kinda toys at home
yeah she does
-um we have -um
we have a lot of play food at home
but we have the other stuff too we have books we have stuffed animals too she plays with all of them
at home
but i dont know
it might be the play
well i dont know the play food is in her brothers room
so sometimes thats enticing
do you think there are any of the foods that she might recognize
well she just ate a cookie before we got here so
so and i think she knows the peas
and then the cup she got real excited about
because shes been learning how to drink out of a cup
and she would know the pizza
i think she gets all excited when we have pizza at home
i dont know
none of the
some of them she wouldnt recognize like she wouldnt know
-um the burger
or some of the cans and boxes
which one would you say she was the most interested out of the different food
probably the spaghetti the spaghetti and the cup
probably the cup she was most interested in
-um she was a little bit interested in the books
i read her one or two books
i think i got one book two books by the last page she was like im done
and in this one like well shes been liking peek a boo books lately and then shes been liking books that have stuff you touch
and again by the end she was real interested but then by like almost at the end she was like thats enough im going back to the food
but the stuffed animals she didnt really seem to care for so
she likes them theyre okay at home like sometimes she likes them and sometimes she really could care less
were there any ones here that she liked
i dont know none that i know she was all interested in the food so
she would barely give them a second look
you said she plays with the food mostly at home
she plays with the food well she plays with her brothers toys so
and the food is in his room
we have books all over the house so
she plays with books at the house -um
but the big toys she plays at our house are actually her blocks
so -um
does she have any dolls or anything
she has a couple she has -um
actually she only has one
she has one doll and my son has a doll
-um we got him one when we were expecting her so
but shell play with them every once in awhile
but yeah her little baby she likes and she has a couple of stuffed animals that she particularly likes
but shes not
attached to any of them
-um lets see the one that she really likes is a little bear you like your bears
and she likes kitties
she really likes cats a lot
any cat she sees if its a picture or a real cat or
a stuffed cat she gets very excited about it because we have two cats
she gets real excited about the cats
yeah she really likes blocks
and balls
thats her other thing she really likes balls a lot
okay i think thats all the questions that i have
the peanut butter
i know
peanut butters one of those things like we put it out on the table when she wasnt allowed to have it yet
then we put it on the table and she just
she could tell it was something that we liked
and shes like
she thought she couldve had it
and she couldnt have it but shes like ah
like she was like i want it you know she was she was pointing at it and she wanted it and we were like youre not sposta get it yet
so i felt bad for her were like you cant have it yet
soon enough
she gets it soon
but yeah when she plays the blocks at home we for awhile she you know for awhile she was shed try to grab them and just you know wreck the tower whatever if like someone was building something shed wreck it up
but then we realized at one point she was trying to actually build
she wasnt trying to destroy she was trying to build and she just couldnt do it
so she would take a block like she would -um take a block and she would try to put it on but she didnt have the coordination to actually let it go the whole tower would knock over
so we hadta tell my son wed be like dont worry shes not trying to wreck it shes trying to help but she just cant do it yet
trying to help
and that kinda helped because he would get all upset if she wrecked up his stuff and
and -um
he realized that she was trying to to help and not just wreck it up he was like oh
what do you think lucy
did you have fun
oh they have this thing
okay so lets see
so which of the toys did she seem most interested in this time
still the food
maybe i needta be feeding her more before she comes here
she still went right to
-um today she seemed to like that bottle a lot
and the peas
okay and last time i cant remember i think
last time it was that yellow box which she still picked up today yeah
the cereal box
and last time she went for the keys and the measuring spoons too
but -um haha
what did she seem
what are you doing
-um she didnt even
touch that pile
look at that pile yeah
even after i showed her the pooh bear
she didnt have any interest in that
does she have ah i cant remember any of these items at home that she plays with
-um i mean we definitely have books everywhere
and ah the kids have a play kitchen
they dont have a lot of food in it
they have more like dishes and things
haha look what you found
-um and shes got a few stuffed animals and -um
okay -um
actually we have quite a few stuffed animals and dolls lying around the house too
but she has a few in her crib just like two or three of them
haha and she seemed interested
she did seem really interested in that clock
i dont know what it was about that
maybe the colors
the colors
yeah you like that one
she seemed to like touching these
so you think its rather than the animals its more the fact that its
she was you know really touching the textures yeah
yeah you were huh
is it soft
recognizes the names of any of these items
i dont know
i im having a really hard time telling if she really you know understands words
like if i say something does she look for it or
-um or does she seem to really know what it is
im not really sure if she does
okay does she have like a favorite toy at home that she knows the n
i think she knows bear
she has a little stuffed bear
and i think she knows bear
do you know bear
im going to switch the microphone over
haha ellie wheres bear
wheres bear
im not sure
but she seems to say
sometimes she says it more consistently
yeah usually if they have like a favorite toy that usually where they start
okay well i think were done for today
im going to go get the basket for her to pick a toy to take home
i can take that microphone
oh okay
we look tired
its ten oclock
so i know it wasnt very long ago that she was here but do you notice any differences in this play session
from which
not really no
she yeah she last time i think she spent more time on the stuffed animals
than the food stuff but
does she know a lot of those animals like
-uh not really no
i mean shes got stuffed animals at home but mostly bears
so she doesnt have a lot of stuffed animals i mean of different kinds
and we have a lot of unusual ones
mhm yeah
the donkey and
hey careful
this has gotta stay no it stays right there
no no
you dont have to write everything down
and it will still pick up what you say
-um okay so you didnt notice any big changes except for that she spent you said some more time
yes she was more interested in the food stuff
i mean she played with the food stuff last time but she was more interested last time in the stuffed animals i think
okay did she have any favorite animal last time
i dont remember
like you said she
i think she did
i think the goose
ah interesting
maybe i was gonna guess maybe dog because you said she liked that book about the dog
but they dont look that much like dogs
i dont remember
i know i think there was one but i cant remember
which one
yeah she didnt seem too interested this time and i
i dont remember last time her being overly interested in it
but did you show her that today
no she looked at it
i didnt pick it up or anything
she kinda picked it up and tossed it aside
to get to what she wanted
so much more into carrying things now
it was just a couple of weeks ago that we
were here
and -um much more into carrying things and throwing
what did she like to carry around
the pizza the spaghetti -uh spoons she loves spoons
hey no throwing
no throwing
-um okay
oh yeah
oh she does okay
yeah she knows spoon
she tried to like scoop up the spaghetti with the spoon
she actually when we feed her she wont eat baby food anymore
she wants big people food but she hasta have a spoon and she tries to feed herself with it
hasnt quite managed it yet but shed trying
does she eat -um peas or
aha she loves peas
pizza spaghetti
noodles of any kind veggies fruit
wow how about the dessert stuff
she -uh shes never seen ice cream like this
-um but she does like ice cream
dont throw it
and lets see
and then did she look at the baby at all or the books
ignored them completely
how does she those things at home or does she have
she well at home books are all over and
she looks at them
baby dolls are a big battle between her and her sister so they usually want if jackies carrying it around she wants it but i guess without jackie being around to introduce the babydoll shes like eh
i dont know
she she has this little babydoll thats only about that big that she loves to carry around
you wanna sit
so she does carry a lot around
and like you said theres books all over the place does she show an interest in those
does she turn the pages or
likes to carry them
aha yeah she likes books she -uh tries to eat them
dont you
lets see are there any other favorite toys that she has at home that we dont have here
-um -uh push thingies like walking
thingies like that kinda stuff but -um
and i noticed you
were singing winnie the pooh
does she watch any of that
she -uh sometimes her favorite is mickey mouse clubhouse
but she does she watches tigger and friends
or my friends tigger and pooh whatever that winnie the pooh is on
but -uh
her big sister watches a lot of cartoons
so she watches them with her sometimes
-um alright
-um is she just as mobile now as she was two weeks ago
yeah pretty much
shes getting a little bit faster but
she was good about not going for the cords i was
wondering if she was gonna do that
yeah -uh what are oh hi
you gonna climb on
all done
maybe youre all done
i think i asked you everything
-um if there was anything i didnt ask about that you saw that she was interested in just let me know that
im hoping so
-uh she definitely was more into the walking over them
last time i think she just walked like a little bit but -uh
well i know does she pour anything
cause you were using the pitcher with her
i dont think she does
but when they get a bath my husband uses -uh pitcher kinda thing to wet their hair but i dont think she pours
shes curious
kay thats it
alright that was great
i just have a few questions
what -um toys did you think that luke liked to play with the most
-um anything food related
he loved the pizza wedges the most
does he have similar toys at home
his actually his brother does and i think he maybe recognized that from before
does he like to play pretend with the foods
-um hes just starting to
so hes just starting to get more active on that part
before he wasnt as interested
so i think these last few weeks hes really starting to come around and realize what the food means
yeah he started to practice with the spoon and he he can feed himself with his fingers
what do you think he likes the least
-um its hard to say he didnt really get too far from this range
-um he didnt really seem too interested in the book i read him
only held his attention for a short time
what book did you read him
-um we read peekababy
do you like to read at home
yes we do read at home a lot
okay what books do you have at home
whats his favorite
quite a few
-um we have a lot of the doctor seuss books the little board books a lot
-um that i read with his brother too so we usually read as a family
a lot
hey buddy bch
does he usually play with dolls at home or no
no since theyre just the two boys they dont are not really -um exposed to dolls as much
we do go to playgroups but i dont think hes noticed so
thats why i thought this time i would see what he would do and he was kind of intrigued for a second but that didnt keep his attention too long
-um is there anything that you remember him playing with last time that you thought he had the same interest in
-um no i he was all over the keys last time and i dont even know if he s didnt see them because they were by under the books but he he played with new things this time
-um so he didnt play with any of the same things this time
mm i think the only thing we did the same was maybe read this book
and i think the toy order might have been a little different
so i do not know if that might have been why
i dont remember how the layout was exactly
do you think he recognizes any of the foods
like does he eat any of these foods at home
-um no hes not onto solids yet hes still on baby food
but -um i notice he does wanna try to put them in his mouth so i think hes maybe getting that correlation that it is food though
do you think maybe he recognizes food that you eat
oh im sure
because we eat a lot of -um like pizza and that kind of stuff because of his brother
what did you find buddy bch
a spoon bch
which of the animals did he seem to like
the only thing he really played with was with the bee word
-um we watch the show at home so i know he knows these a lot
-um but he didnt really show any interest in any of the other ones
oh and i showed him the frog but he didnt gear towards it i hadta prompt it
do you have any animals at home
-uh you mean as far as pets or stuffed animals
-um we dont have any pets we have tons of stuffed animals so he plays with those a lot at home
which ones his favorite
at home
-um probably its his teddy bear thats also his security blanket its like attached
so hes usually plays with that the most
yeah bch
you did great
thanks so much for coming in
oh youre welcome
its kinda fun to play with him by ourselves
we usually have his brother to contend with so
its a great opportunity then
you gotta play by yourself without your brother snapping stuff away from you bch
what you do you think she was most interested in today
well id say the peas and the dog
was there any particular dog that she liked
the one with the pink collar
yes mhm
do you think -um that theres any reason that she likes peas in particular
she loves peas
i mean definitely of this food the peas would be the thing that i think she would recognize as something she eats at home
and she loves them
i dont know
maybe thats it
i mean theyre kinda realistic relative to the others
and -um she tries to eat them so
they do look more foodlike
was she interested at all in any of the other
there was a little milkshake that she was interested in from time to time
and she tried talking on the cheese like it was a cellphone
and -um she looked at other stuff
she liked the pitcher
-um she like tried put things inside the pitcher
i thought there were some measuring spoons here
oh yeah she looked at the measuring spoons
she liked to shake those
does she play with anything similar to these things
like especially the food items at home
she has a little picnic set
its plush so i think tactically it would be very different
and im not sure she would recognize the similarities
you know what i mean
to me or you its like fake food
but i think its very different from the plastic stuff
she has some play dishes
i mean she has her own dishes that are plastic
that are similar to these but just a little bit bigger
that she plays with
oh does she have any babydolls at home
she has one very small one thats more similar to these than that one
she got kind of scared when
did she
i mean not really but she had the bottle and i was trying to show her that the bottle belonged to the baby and she was not pleased with that
not pleased huh
did she think it was hers do you think
i think she did
i think she did
i think she sees the babydoll as threatening
thats really interesting
because its almost as big as she is you know
shes small for her age
and thats a big doll huh
thats a big doll
and you were giving it to someone else
one other thing that i thought was funny
was that she liked all the stuffed animals
but she definitely recognized that little brown one with the pink furry thing as a dog
and she -um she howled at it
which my husband taught her to howl with the dogs
so she was like communicating with the little dogs
so she must have known that was a dog
i think so
i think so
thats interesting
because it doesnt look that much like a dog
well not that much
it has the four legs
and we have yorkies at home who are really small and
got it
got it
heidi whered you shoe go
does she express any interest in books
she did
she likes books
she loves them at home but i think there were so many other distractions here but
she liked this one
and she loves the pet and feel book
she has some of those at home
so have her interests changed since she was here
i know she was here pretty recently
i dont think so
i mean i think they probably change a little bit day by day
you know just what her mood is and whats more interesting in that moment
but i wouldnt say that her interests have changed really
i noticed that shes maturing very quickly it seems to me
like shes developing quickly and is able to do things that wasnt able to do and is more expressive and communicative
and is better able to let me know what she wants
but i dont think her wants are really different from what theyve been
theyre just shes better able to
to express them
do you think shes playing differently than she was with the toys
-um i dont remember well enough to say really
if she was you might remember
yeah i mean i think maybe last time we had a little bit more success just reading books all the way through
and now she was just a little more interested in everything else that was going on around
she seems like she gotta all the groups
yeah she did
she did
so you read a little bit to her with the book that she picked out
yeah we almost finished that one
and we got about half way through the book
and i think thats it
so there was some interest
at home when we read we you know sit down in a chair and read through four books at a time
and shes really into it
but you know its not in an environment like this where she gets to choose what she wants to do
shoes are off
i think thats it
unless theres anything that you noticed that i didnt ask you about
i dont think so
say thank you
so next time shes gonna be two
youre gonna be practically a grownup
i know
here ill just that off so you can take it off
practically a grownup
is it okay if i ask you some things
ask us some questions
so what do you think she liked the most
the food still
she still hasnt
really gone near anything
besides the food
like all three visits
she just loves the food
i dont know
she likes to eat
-um do you have the stuffed animals
we have stuffed animals at home
we have books at home
some of those books at home
-um we have play food
but its been put in the basement
since before christmas
because the christmas tree went there
but she really
like she went right for the pizza
the first thing
she hasnt touched a nonfood item practically
since weve been in here
she played with a little while seal
a little bit
i even brought
the baby over
cause you said sometimes they like the baby
she gave the baby a bunch of stuff
oh well thats good
yeah shes that giving
i give it to you and then you give it back to me
and then i give it to you and then you give it back to me
so were at that phase
but -um she still seems to have no interest for anything else
besides the food
do you think she recognizes -um the name
as familiar with some of the names of the food
i dont know
i know she eats peas
at home -um
but we dont feed her pizza
so i dont know
shes eaten spaghetti
she seems to like the spoons
which she gets spoons at home
-um but she doesnt drink juice at home
so its food but not food that we i guess normally would eat
or that she would normally eat
she eats cheese at home
but she didnt touch the cheese
she eats a lot of bread
she loves bread
but didnt really touch the bread either
and she does love keys
but who doesnt
who doesnt love keys
does she play with your keys
theyre pretty away
she has her own keys to play with
well my keys are lost in the car right now
but someplace at the police impound lot
-um yeah
were gonna go back when its warmer and look for them again
you doing so good
you such a big girl
do you wanna play with something else
you like that spoon
whats going on
is she playing with dolls at home
shes got stuffed things at home
one kind of looks like a doll
but no
she plays mostly with blocks
and cars
and -um books
she does play with the books more at home than she does here
we have some that have pictures of babies in them and she seems to like those a lot
she likes to put everything up to her head
like its a telephone
thats kinda funny
but yeah mostly its blocks
she really likes blocks
and she likes to pull things out of stuff
so like all the toys are in a big bin
and shell sit there and she just pulls them out
she likes to take them out and then sometimes shell put them back in
but -um
doesnt matter whats in the bin
she just pulls it out
and she loves -um magnets right now
so she discovered that she could take the magnets off the fridge and she could put them on the dishwasher
or if they come off the fridge and you put them back on the fridge
so were at a
the magnet you know
do you like it
but she likes the magnets
you do
are you -um doing kind of like you know does she know
does she know kind of like
hm no
we havent been doing that yet
we havent
were trying to get some of the sign language going
because now i mean i can kind of move my arm a little more now
we were staring before the accident
and now were trying to start back up again
cause we did it with nathan
i dont know if it helped at all
but we did it with him
oh okay
oh now were going to make a mess
oh yeah
oh shes happy while were talking
shes very good at playing independently you know
shell be happy to sit with a pile of stuff
and play with it
where nathan didnt like to do that
so i dont know if its cause youre second or cause youre a girl or cause youre just different
i dont know
i dont know
do you think -um is she eating out like using a spoon or just -um
i mean shell hold onto it
but she cant use it yet
but shes self feeding with just fingers
so she likes to do it herself
so she likes cubes of cheese
pieces of banana -um
weve done rice kind of mushed up
anything that she can pick up
cooked carrots and pieces -um
she like peas a lot because she can pick them up
and then you know
shell change her mind
and decide that she doesnt want anymore peas anymore ever
does she pick up each individual pea
or do you
it takes like forty five minutes to eat a meal
0 yeah
and she eats like four meals a day
so thats a long time
were in the high chair a long time
and she eats each bite
and then she plays a little bit
and then she eats a little more
and then she plays
whered it go
oh no
oh no
that was amazing
do you wanna go get it
you can go get it

yeah that was excellent
that was excellent
and shes
getting teeth so her appetites a little different now
she wants it a little blander
like lots of just plain bread
plain bread
plain bananas plain
did she play with the bread here
no she didnt and thats whats really weird
because she loves bread
loves bread
is this how she sees it
yeah pretty much
i mean we kind of tear it up into little pieces
but she knows like when you get a piece of bread she knows
and -uh she wont -um
she wont eat anything else
if she sees you go for the bread
she will not eat anything else until she gets that piece of bread
bread muffins noodles anything carbohydraty
granola bars -um
its just like those oatmeal cinnamon bars kind of thing
loves those
thank you
did you put the pizza on the plate
its upside down
is she eating cookies
even the like not so much like cookies but
she eats cookies
yeah good she didnt touch them
i dont know if we had shown her the mm cookies
but i would that she would recognize the shape
and the size are similar
yeah i know
whoopsies what you doing
thats the floor
there you got a plate
we dont give her plates yet
then things just kind of end up on the floor
what do you think shes
liking about these plates here
i dont know
maybe she likes anything really that she can pick up
if she can pick it up
she likes it
what you doing
you being all crazy
did you lose your binky
yeah she does like to pick things up
she likes
-um do you think that she -um knows what her binky is
oh yes
the name binky
she knows what it is
i dont know if she knows the name
but she knows
if she sees it and she wants it she makes it very clear
you like that spoon
where you going
this is a new thing too
she crawls and carries it
and you said she kind of just holds the spoon
when shes eating
she can
we normally dont let her though
it gets messy
hate to say it but a lot of things that she could do
she doesnt do
because theyre just too messy for mommy
yeah you having fun
she likes to hit
did she play with the measuring spoons too
she didnt today
did you play with those
do you wanna go look at the measuring spoons
yeah what do you think
they make noises like keys
what are you doing
oh gotta get that spoon
here lets get the measuring spoons
mommys gonna get the measuring spoons
oh its over here
yeah lets get these
what do you think of these
what do you think
those are exciting
where you going
what are you doing
so the last time she played with food as well
yeah shes played with food every time
every time
and the first time i tried really hard to show her everything
did you say though -um the last time that you had purchased a food kit
weve had one but it was in the kitchen
she wasnt really crawling yet so i moved it from the kitchen to the living room
because she seemed to like playing with it here
but then christmas came and then i took it out of the living room completely
so she hasnt really had access to ours
again mostly at our house she plays with the blocks
and the trucks
and -um
anything thats inside of her like bin
rattles keys and again she doesnt really play with the item
she takes it out she kind of looks at it she puts it down
shell pick it up shell put in back in kind of thing
its an out and an in thing
there we go
whats over there
huh whats over there
-uh-oh you dropped your spoon
can you get it
thats very good
i think
oh no she didnt get it i thought she got it
there you go
good job
but itll be interesting to see what she does when shes two years old
when she comes back and
well thats -um next visit right
we might have a different phone number then
would you like my cell phone number
yeah do we not have that on file
i have no idea
but its nine seven three
five eight zero
you want your peas bch
peas bch
you can play while we talk bch
with the toys bch
and not the big girl toys bch
the little girl toys bch
she was here just very recently and i dont remember -um i was in the play session or not but anyway maybe you can just tell me any observations you have about -uh if shes playing with different toys or if shes playing differently than last time
mm basically the same she loves this plastic play food
at home her favorite thing is books but she doesnt care about the books here
because she has this cool stuff
because like i said before shes obsessed with food like shes really into eating
she begs like a dog at the table for just scraps of food so i guess anything that
so do you think she thinks that those look like food
looks like its edible
like would she recognize any of those items as food that shes had at home or shes seen you guys eat
im not sure
maybe the peas
but i do not know if its just the texture might feel good on her gums
but i know that she recognizes this for a bottle and she recognizes this for a sippy cup because shes like
and she knows that these are cookies im pretty sure
any of the other foods that you think -um shes been exposed to
-um i dont think so
and how about -um the utensils and things like that does she have anything like that at home or play with real
-um she has measuring spoons that i mean she kinda clacks around with them for thirty seconds and then
but i guess the thing shes into now is putting stuff into things
so last time she didnt put things in things like she did this time
and remove them
like shell just sit there at home and put things in boxes and take them out over and over again
and she did that here
so thats
thats neat
i would say
very cool
-um she didnt look at the stuffed animals is that right
no she doesnt care about stuffed animals
does she have any stuffed animals at home
she has a lot
does she like them
she just doesnt care
how about baby dolls does she have any baby doll at home
she has a baby doll at home and she likes to lick and kiss on its face
but i couldnt get her to do that maybe because this one is kinda scary looking
oh no
there we go
there we go much better
but i do not know if she
do you like babies bch
okay bch
but shes more into like i guess working on her motor skills than playing now
like she doesnt care about toys if she can move around
in general
that sorta makes sense for this age too
thats more common
yeah like
so you said at home she does have a lot of books and she likes them
does she like to turn the pages herself
-um and does she have favorite ones
like that she would go and get for you to read to her or
i think pat the bunny
what did you find bch
what is it bch
what is it bch
yeah well thats her favorite thing is to find
i dont know where you found that bch
find scraps
i dont see any more bch
thank you bch
any more bch
what are you doing bch
finding all the stuff that shouldnt be there bch
i dont need a vacuum cleaner any more
how do you do that bch
how did you do that bch
tell me bch
what do you like to play with bch
hm bch
oh i love a baby this age
its fun
it is fun
youre fun bch
you keep mom busy i bet bch
so shes interested in -um doing moving around type of stuff and she probably has toy different toys at home that she likes too that -um that we dont have here
-um yeah
like pushing toys or
yeah she has like a little push wooden push wagon thing that she likes to use up and down the hallway
and basically anything thats not designed to be a toy she prefers
like toilet paper tubes and candy wrappers
just that kind of stuff
my laptop she likes to type on the keys
so she has a keyboard that she just kind of like bangs on
so do you think that shes imitating you
-um are there any other differences between what she was sort of doing here and what she does at home in terms of play
she doesnt stay very focused on her toys at home
like in the time that i was sitting here playing with her she would have been up twice and left where she was
and found another thing of toys in another room
okay so shes more active in general is what youre saying
-um i think thats it
all i have to ask you if -um theres anything you think i missed
-um no i dont think
i think thats pretty good
you did a good job bch
you are capable of moving around bch
so now im gonna ask you some
questions yes
thats good
shes all over the place -um
she is
i know you guys always wanna know what do i think is her favorite
oh yes so what you think was her favorite
thats a tough call probably the baby
and she always loves the food
i think i tell you guys every time i think its just because we have so much of it at home its all over the place you know because we have the kitchen with the older daughter and
she sees it a lot its everywhere
not necessarily the exact same things but similar ones you know
plastic food
oh she sees plastic food a lot
plastic food yeah
yeah she plays with that like her sisters always trying to feed her plastic food you know what i mean make meals for her and that kinda stuff yeah
so she sees plastic food a lot
and in the past shes always loved the keys
so i said even to her right away look somebody has the keys apart this time because theyre on a
and she loves the jingling the the noise they make
that and like these spoons
if the spoons were all connected she would have right away gone to those two
she didnt even touch these
because theyre all separated
i thought that was very interesting
because she loves anything that makes a noise that she can jangle like that
so she loves the keys and the spoons when theyre together and i noticed they were apart this time that was very interesting
i wonder if thats because theyre older just to see what they do with them
i dont know why that is
yeah maybe
thats why i said maybe someone tore them apart
like you bch
like a destructor baby like you bch
yeah because they have been on a a ring in the past and theres the other one
so maybe it was just a fluke
maybe it wasnt sposta be on purpose
yeah i dont know
thats kinda funny
and heres all these little spoons usually are connected too
or at least they have been
she saw plastic food does she see those real foods like does she see pizza
pizza she does yes
she hates peas but she hasta eat them
she does love regular icecream
she kept picking up the jar of peanut butter which i thought was interesting because shes never eaten peanut butter
shes not even really around when im making a peanut butter sandwich for her sister you know
so that she definitely doesnt -um
the bottle and the juice both she tried to drink herself you know
with both right away
the pizza shes fascinated with them i dont know why
because we dont eat pizza with any of that stuff on it at our house
i dont know if its because it has a lot of the colors
do you think that she knows its pizza
i dont know
i dont know
i i wish i knew i dont know
she might but i just dont know
because she will eat pizza
hi bch
she loved reading the books she likes the fuzzy book
she does like that
and she loved the baby ive never its the first time shes ever leaned in and given it a kiss
that was the first time we had ever done that she gave
the baby a kiss
didnt you bch
you gave the baby a kiss bch
and i asked the other girl i had asked the other girl before i came in i said do you want me to like try and get her to talk like in her words or do you want me to just not
you know do you want me to not influence her
and she said whatever i wanted to do is fine
because she talks like all the time and we have like conversations like oh
now what is she
you know like its just a sound she makes
and so we just imitate it back to her all the time and so then we have these conversations in language i call them
oh and she starts
she started it yes it was her starting it
and and
but see like ill say to her and then shell go oh you know what i mean
so i influenced her and started it here but she came up with the word herself i dont even know when a long time ago
and thats just kinda
and it will refer to whatever youre doing
anything exactly whatever youre doing at the time yep
cause i noticed you
anything in any situation yep
so now its just a word that she just uses
its just a madeup word she uses for anything yep
yeah to replace whatever she cant say yeah
because she really only says like momma dada baba and baby
yeah shes pretty talk talkative
baby bch
addressed to the child
baby bch
yes youre the baby bch
now so the food was definitely the big hit and she has that stuff at home
and then you noticed she kissed the doll this time
does she play with dolls at home
-uh she does but not a ton but she does have them
we do have them at home and she does play with them at home
yeah she does like the babydolls at home too
a baby bch
a baby bch
she hasnt ever like tried to tear the clothes off or dress them or undress them yet or anything like that
but she picks them up and carries them around you know and theyre dragging by their feet and stuff like that she does
whenever like they have little high chairs her sister puts them in the high chairs and shell pull them out
she puts them in the stroller she pulls them out
you know
and shes fascinated by their hair a lot of time shes like
you know pulling out their hair
i said thats because you dont have any
thats because you dont have any of your own bch
see were still playing with the food i dont know why
and -um the books were
youre klutzy bch
-uh this one i know she likes
i think i did the same ones as last time because i know she likes them
and the peekaboo baby one
she because i knew they capture her attention
she would have for a couple minutes but she prefers the interactive stuff at this age
she would have you know gotten up or hit me or thrown it or pulled it away from me or something
shell sit for the first few minutes of it and then shes squirming or grabbing at it or wanting to put it in her mouth or you know because its a a more advanced book you know
from what her sister would pick or something so
but shes sitting longer and longer you know its getting a little bit better shell sit for a little more of it
and i know that gets better with age too
but those two are so good because the feeling and then the peekaboo
and do you have any of these
-um i we have some of those i dont think shes ever touched them though
i dont know if we even have those exact two
we have good night moon not the counting one
we have the regular good night moon
shes heard that one -um the peekaboo we dont have it but weve had it at the library
and then the feely one we actually -um were playing with a little boy yesterday while sissy was at soccer who had the a book very similar and had feely stuff in it so we did this book yesterday
it wasnt ours though it was just borrowed so we dont have that
right bch
we dont have that one bch
now the clock i didnt know if shed be interested or not just because of the feel of it foamy
she looked at it for a few minutes but then
yeah nothing there to capture her too much whereas her sister would have loved it shes interested in telling all of the time even though she has no concept of it
shes always like what time is it mommy
and im like do you have somewhere to go
what do you have a date
yeah im like its two oclock why
when will it be five oclock
hm in three hours
is that a long time
im like in my world not really but in your world probably
in your world probably
you know
-um and what about the animals
the stuffed animals
i tried a little bit with her but she didnt she didnt seem to wanna pick them up and play with them herself though
we have a whole bin of those things at home though and the girls dont play with them a whole ton
usually theyre just thrown all over you know just to empty them out just to throw them but they dont play with them a lot
they dont treat them like a babydoll or anything like that
but we have lots of those dont we bch
so i tried to do a little bit of everything just to see what she would prefer
obviously her favorite thing is walking
walking around all over the place
she really likes things that play music make noise
so everything is so interactive now because everybodys so a d i guess
she loves all the stuff with the lights and noise and we have a lot of those kinds of things
mostly hand-me-downs from sissy but they were
and shes a dancing baby
arent you bch
are you a dancing baby bch
whenever she hears music
can you show your dancing bch
you wanna do dancing baby bch
can you do dancing bch
shake your butt do your dancing baby bch
because we have the ones that are like the magnetic things on the fridge and if you push the button it you know sings a song
i see you dancing bch
dancing right bch
yeah bch
youll just shake that whole butt of yours wont you bch
so if you had any toys like that in there she would have liked those too you know
oh like a light up kind of thing interactive yeah
with music yeah buttons are good she would have loved anything like that too
this is the good old-fashioned stuff though right
yeah this is the good old-fashioned toys
say crazy bch
what do you see bch
what do you see bch
oh water bubbler bch
she had a look at everything
aha bch
but it was mostly the food
mostly the food and the baby
yeah the food and the baby got the
and then those two books she did enjoy
that was good
but were working on it
oh thats funny
thats what the baby does
so this
you know tambourines
so thats those types of toys are her favorite so we didnt have any of her favorite but we did have ones that
those are the kind of stuff she loves yes
shes perfectly fine
well you know what
perfectly entertained
-um so -uh which of the toys do you think seemed to interest her the most
-um she liked to shake the measuring spoons and the keys
do you play with those at home
why do you think that interested her
actually -uh i think she likes them because they make noise
you can shake them
-um -uh and which toys do you think she likes the least
stuffed animals
and why do you think that is
does she play with stuffed animals at home or
-um not a lot
and most of the stuffed animals she has a at home are bigger too
-um which foods would you say she was the most attracted to
-um the waffles
-um she picked those up right away
and then the cookies
-um and what about the books do you think shes interested in them or
-um when we first came in she went straight to the books first
and then she got distracted by the other stuff
and is there anything here that -um shes never seen before or does she have all this stuff at home
we dont have any play food at home
or baby dolls like this
she just has like -um theyre kinda like stuffed animal baby dolls
they dont really look real
-um do you that might be why she was not as interested in these
well yeah once i showed her how to do i guess do the bottle and the cup she tried to feed the baby a little bit
she thought that was interesting
okay and do you -um normally like read these books to her at all
has she ever seen these before
no we dont have i dont think any of these books at home
we have i guess the regular good night moon
but no we dont have any of these specific books at home
okay do you think she recognizes the names of anything
-um she knows dog
she might know baby
but she might think thats herself
shes so funny
-um so she likes to play with the fake food at home too
we dont have any fake food at home
no because shes a little bit young for it still
does she doesnt eat waffles at home right
no she doesnt
she she really doesnt eat much of any of this at home
okay well i think thats all the questions that i have
do you have any questions
i think thats it thank you so much for coming in
i love her hair
i know shes a little poofball puffball
and the ear rings too
oh so cute
you stacking them up
its her new favorite thing is stacking
that kind of stuff
i think we have enough of you guys playing together
you gonna show judy the bee
youre almost carrying it like a doll maybe
yeah he doesnt have -um a whole lot of stuffed animals i guess
he has a few
but this is a new things where he gets really excited
and its like straining to be excited
its very funny
yeah -um so there he goes
thats why its kind of strange to play with him in this setting to see what he wants
because were so active and we do a lot of like chasing around the house and
aha different kind of playing
-um so he does play with toys
dont get me wrong
but -um its much more physical
in a way
sitting and playing quietly is really not what you do at home
but you said he does
but he does
he does do that like with some independent play
he has blocks at home
and we will build towers
and he tends to knock them down
which was why i was surprised that he didnt knock it over right away
-um he doesnt have a baby doll
so -um and obviously hes an only child
he doesnt have
a baby
a baby
not that we know about
and -um so i mean its kind of funny how he fixated on that bottle
he doesnt use a bottle
i mean well not ever
but -um i breastfeed him
and then he drinks from a glass
-um he doesnt even really use a sippycup
we tried
but he just focuses on it kind of like that
so it is not very helpful
right thats interesting
so are you saying so he spent a lot of with the bottle
okay you liked the bottle
he liked the bottle
and he seemed to like that pile of spaghetti
ah which is
somewhere around here
its over here
oh okay
but i dont know
was there anything different from last time
ill sit over there
no sweetie dont do that
was there anything that you think he was interested in this time that he wasnt interested in last time
i dont
no chords
i dont remember what he did last time
-um i feel like last time he was more into the books
than the plastic food stuff
-um but this time it seemed to be you know what hes doing
although it might also be because hes teething
yeah i saw that it looked like he has some new ones coming in
yeah he got ah these two
and now hes got another one coming in at the bottom
and i think hes got a couple more that are poking through
so is that what you think is going on with some of the hard things
thats what i think
and thats why maybe the bottle was really appealing because its got a hard nipple thing on it
right that makes sense
but he liked a little bit of the stuffed animal play
ah yeah
i mean i think that he ah you know he likes that
whered that bee thing go
he likes this because i think he likes the rubber part of it with
its exciting
and you read a little bit
-um a little bit
we have this type of book at home
but he didnt seem to be all that interested in it
recently he has decided that he likes books
but only to be excited about the book
and bringing it to you to read
but then he doesnt have the attention span to actually sit there and read it
-um but he has some favorite books
we have
big box of books
and ill say
go get me olivia
and hell go and pick out the book
like so he knows
his favorite is the pokey little puppy
which i understand why he doesnt wanna sit through it
its very long
but -um he loves it
and he will -um get it -um every time
like on many occasions
thats his favorite its clear thats his favorite
but we have no idea why
because he never reads it
well you guys are a little bit mysterious huh
you young guys
we dont know exactly whats going on
we dont really get any clearer as they get older
so -um so thought that this kind of stuff was his favorite today
i think so yeah
i think that seemed -um to be a preference
and you liked the bottle and spaghetti
and those were the two main ones that he liked this time
yeah and this bee thing
the bee yeah
i mean obvi this is more his usual mode of play
where he gets up
and he tries to get in things
and hes running around
and hes kind of crazy
quiet playing was kind of interesting to me even because he doesnt usually do that haha
getting around like that
-um oh you said something about this one
oh -um -um theres a white stuffed poodle
that we named nellie because that was our white poodles name when we had one
and ah he loves nellie
and he will as soon as he gets there go and get her and then pick her up
and so this is a pink nellie
and so this one
thats what you were saying pink nellie
you see the pink nellie
not interested
thats not anything like nellie huh
this one maybe more like nellie
what does a chicken say
yeah hes doing it
so do you think he prefers books or toys
oh -um i think probably toys
although he looks at books as toys
like its all part of the same thing
theres not a clear delineation that this is a book
and this is what you do with a book
hell take the book
and hell
does he get them out by himself
and l and does he turn pages
or is he sort of unloading more
-um i would say unloading
and then he really wants ah to share it
and th that seems to
so and when you turn the pages he does try to turn the pages
but we only use the board books
because if its a real book he will rip the pages out so
and weve decided that we dont want him to continue to do that
so we took away all those books
so its a little bit harder even for his
hes got pretty good coordination
to turn the pages of the book
hes pretty active huh
and you dont really have dolls at home
and -um you have a few stuffed animals
he has a few
oh yeah he liked
the keys
he likes to make noise
so -um he plays in the kitchen with me while im -um making dinner and stuff
so he likes the teaspoons
in fact i think i have one in my purse
-um the measuring spoons and the -um
i put them in the purple pitcher because he likes to make noise
so we have a lot of things that have something else in it that shake
he likes that a lot
okay i remember now you did that
why are you sitting like that
move your foot
thank you
no sitting huh
i mean
my ah mother in-law taught school in thailand
and she said all the kids did that
and its just so terrible for their hip development and their knees so
and i didnt even know it
i mean i was like hes so flexible
i figured he can do whatever
but she was like he shouldnt do that
they tend to do it to get some trunk support
yeah exactly
and with that big belly you need some extra help dont you
lets see
was there anything that you noticed
or that you have noticed since the last visit that has changed or that you think is interesting
-um well i mean ah he has gotten a lot more excited
aha than you said
can you fit that whole thing in your mouth
or you gonna come get it
give it to me
be careful thats kind of pokey
if you fall down it might hurt you
-um i mean if i saw what he did last time i could probably s say what more of his -um changes were
but at home i guess -um he has gotten a lot more deliberate in his play
and more interactive
so you know that he will bring more things to you
or you know if i do build things he will -um kind of yeah take them down
he hasnt gotten to the point where he puts them away
we tried to teach him the putting away game
but i think hes on to us already
hes too smart
hes too smart about the cleaning up
it was interesting the way he took that tower down one by one
thats new actually
he useta just kno
we call him joezilla
hed just knock everything over
but he has again gotten a little bit more deliberate with things so
yeah and i had a
im surprised he could do it
hes got a lot of -um fine motor coordination
which means that hes eating lint and other small things that he can find on the floor
old peas
im like oh i really gotta be a better house cleaner now
-um so oops i forgot
-um so thats kind of a change too
and that hes really gotten into the chasing games
like i will just chase him around the house
and then hell chase me
-um so thats kind of a new thing
and we have balls
he loves balls
so we have a football
and we have a baseball
and which is just the ball at our house
and then we have a new ball thats for outside play
and at my moms house he has two balls
and he loves them
loves them
and he picks them up
and he does this thing with his hands i guess that my husband and i did that a lot
like you know how you hit the ball before you throw the football kind of thing
so he does that and then
those are not for you okay
lets leave those here
lets leave them in here
and then -um he -um is k starting to get into kicking
but he loves
and th theres a like one of those plastic balls that you get at ah giant
thats great
sweetie dont break it
we needta throw that away
not a good toy for this
-um but w ah i bought one
and we took it outside yesterday
and h its in his stroller
and he keeps trying to get it out
he cant get it out
its too big
its in there
but hes like i want this
really attracted to balls
alright well wouldve been interesting if we had one here
oh yeah
my guess is that wouldve been
a favorite
i mean im
shes on to you
shes knows
which toys do you think asher was interested in
definitely interested in the food
yeah hes been that way -uh
all three times
and he also likes the baby
and the bottle anything plastic that he can chew on
so would you say that -um his interests really havent changed since the last time of which toys that hes gone to
was there anything that was new or that he didnt go to
his interests have pretty much stayed the same
hes more interested in the baby and feeding the baby than he was last time
that was new
but for the most part yeah he paid some attention to the books and a lot of attention to the food and
are these the type of things that he has at home
-um he does not have any plastic food at home
he does have some stuffed animals he does not have a babydoll
lots of foods so
some of each i guess
i mean he doesnt have food but he has lots of plastic things that he likes to stick in his mouth so
now the books was it mostly just you picking up a book or do any of them he wanted to go to
it was mostly just me -uh
which is interesting at home he loves books and here hes not as interested he doesnt really
he didnt really go to any of them
but like the touch and feel one he played with for a little bit and felt the appropriate
do you have books like that at home
little circle
mhm yes
he does
ah hi
you mentioned he has a lot of books at home is that mostly what he plays with or you also like what would be the thing that he plays with the most at home
what he plays with at home is everything hes not sposta hes more interested in mommy and daddys stuff than he is in his own stuff but
-uh with his toys he has like -uh
he has some plastic nesting cups you know that kind of fit inside each other and stack up and he really likes those
oh and he -uh
but he likes his books a lot at home he plays with -uh
he has a few -uh like a stacker toy
but he likes that although mainly the pulling it apart but
-um so you mentioned he liked the food a lot but he doesnt have those types of things at home but do you think that he recognized any of them as the food like does he eat any of those
yeah we do waffles and peas and he eats those i think he might recognize those
-uh the pizza i think he mainly likes the fun shape to it
but -uh
because hes never really eaten pizza before hes seen it
but he hasnt eaten a whole lot of it so
yeah i think he does actually recognize it as food
i dont think he did the first couple of times
but now i think he does make more of an association
oh is that locked
so he cant get that open
i think so
-um when you were playing with him you said a lot of the names out loud do you think he recognizes theses these m s names like the things you were saying do you think he
i think he does
i think most of them
knows starting to recognize the world
most of them
rattle rattle rattle
-uh huh
good thing it was towards the end
-um what do you think
she seemed to like the most
she liked shaking the keys
i think she liked the pasta too
or the food i guess
is that different from last time
cause last time i feel like i mean she spent time with the baby this time or
this time i felt like she spent more time with the food and the keys than the baby
how did she play with the baby this time
-um she still sort of exploring it
i feel like
looking at the eyes but just sort of
and she kissed it but
oh yup and there she goes
is she looking at particular like body parts or do you talk about particular body parts
we do
and -um its funny because we have friends that have babies
and when we get together with them shes very into looking at their different you know just checking them all out and everything like that
is our like eyes nose mouth familiar to her
familiar terms
i think so
we do a little thing where she knows like fingers and nose and toes i think because we do like kissy kissy finger kissy kissy nose
oh okay
how about the food at this -uh point
are there new foods that are more familiar to her
well i mean she eats waffles
and she eats bread
and she eats carrots
and then
my mom at her house and we go over to her house quite often has clay pizza and clay spaghetti
she eats some spaghetti sometimes
mash it up
right do we mash up spaghetti
so it doesnt exactly look like that but yeah you know it
a little bit
i guess
she eats it plain
yes yes for the most part
sometimes well add in well mash it up cause she only has two teeth so
well mash it up and then we put in some vegetable or something with it so
youll eat it
so not necessarily tomato but something else so carrot sauce or something on top
you like your farm animals
do you think do you have play food at home
we do have some play food at home
most of the play food that we have at home is -um well we have pots and pans
so they pretend like her older brother will pretend to make something and say here you go ella this is whatever
but then a lot of it is just plain -um like plastic cans and stuff like that so we dont have this detailed stuff
thank you
and so she usually plays with her brother with those things
yup yes
do you guys cook in the kitchen
do you like to cook in the kitchen
oh you want me put you down
you can play with the baby doll you can play with all these toys just not the wire
it was very
what was the toy that was least interesting to her
what did you think was least interesting huh
what did you find least interesting
did she play
maybe the book
what oh what im sorry
oh no i was gonna say the book
but no go ahead
but well but i mean she was i felt like she was into it
shes trying to do some of the like mimic some of the sounds
they have -um a fisherprice the farm
and so hell take some of the animals and hell be like a cow says ella
and shell be like i mean sometimes shell say it sometimes she wont but
so shes like familiar with the animals sounds
yes yes
-uh which animal sounds are
shell do
i mean i mean he is a boy so hell be like so its
she like imitates the
but -um she does and
and sometimes i think she tries to do cluck cluck cluck
cant quite get it yet what thats a
thats a yeah
thats funny
sometimes we try
cause we also have a horse we both ride
do you have -um is this the only book that you read here today
mhm mhm
do you have books like that at home
where you can like touch and feel
and we actually have well we have put me in the zoo
but the full size one so she doesnt really get into it
i mean she gets into it but
because they have the regular pages we try to just do the board books cause shes not quite -um gentle enough with the ones that have the regular pages so
so we just do that at nap time
youre funny
-uh what about the stuffed animals
she was into the winnie the pooh and punxsutawney phil
i felt like but then the rest of them she didnt really get into i guess this time
are there any -um animal names that shes
maybe shes
im trying to think
she knows she might know what a frog a frog she would might know
she knows -um again farm animals
i guess she wouldve known the chicken except for most the chickens we have a brown chickens just for i do not know for whatever reason we have
i mean we dont have real chicken but you know like the different pieces you know or different little play things are brown chickens
i do not know if she would
and then again farm animals
we have a lot of farm animals
and we have like giraffes and elephants and stuff
huh we dont have a zebra at home
she might know a dog
but she doesnt really like real dogs so
oh okay
i dont
she knows what that looks like at least
yes yes
do you think -um have there been any changes since the last visit in terms of how she plays with toys
oh sorry
can you hand that back to mommy please
shell watch her brother do stuff and then shell sort of do that
and the other thing is that at home i mean we have a doll and stuff but most of the things we have are like cars and trucks and stuff just because
thats what our brother liked
and so we have so shell play with those and shell like vroom the car and stuff like that
oh okay
so more like
is she still banging and playing that way
yes shell bang things together
we have a play piano
but you know just like a little kids one it has like the four things
and shell bang on that and play the music
the foot book
we have that character at home
and is she using utensils to eat
-um she tries to grab the spoon
when were feeding her but she cant quite get it to her her mouth yet
-um its very messy so
so we try
yeah experimental right
very experimental
but then youll
well do -um
things like ill cut up bananas and stuff and shell take it with her hand
but she cant quite get it in the spoon yet
what are you doing
she fell so gentle at first
shes a little dramatic too
yes she loves keys
real keys
real keys
shell shake my keys
and shell play with those
she likes to do that
youre just
you see the chicken
that what a chicken says
think youre getting teeth
that would be nice
and does she usually play with -um toys like this
this kinda like this all round and
we have like something like that where you have the different buckets
so each of the buckets have sort of a different thing in it
and my ideal is to have william her brother take one out and then play with that and then put it back
but that doesnt necessarily always happen
you know we try but
so a lot of times there are different toys spread out that she will go and figure out
and play with
where you going
she has a hammer she likes to hammer too
oh this way ella bee
oh does she
do you like to hammer
measuring spoon
you help us measure
nos her favorite
well unfortunately i think recently weve heard that a lot
cause we like to go up stairs
we like to find cords
we like to find and play with things were not sposta play with
those are the things that interest us
and oh
oh yes oh her brother will say that a lot too and be like oh
thats funny no and oh
no oh
is there anything else that -um you noticed that was different about this session that she played with or didnt play with
i was very surprised she didnt play with the babys shoes
because at home she will work very hard to find everyones shoes
and play with the shoes
and i mean she tries to chew on them too but like just play with them and everything
yesterday she just got a pair of shoes from when were outside and -um she was obsessed with those too
i was surprised that she didnt on the baby doll
now she doesnt have a baby doll that has shoes
all of her baby dolls are pretty much soft baby dolls
so they have like the shoes already on you know on them or whatever they dont come off so i dont know but i was kinda surprised
cause she does like shoes
oh cause she didnt know if she even knew that they came off type of thing
right yeah
or i mean i was just
oh are you chewing on the the dog
yeah thats a dog
let us not chew on his nose
nah yeah
he might not like to have his nose chewed on
can he give you kisses though
let us give the dog kisses
shes like wait thats a dog
i know get him away from me no
ah yeah thats peanut butter
-um im trying to think
what else
was different
this way
come this way
hm i love you
oops sorry
its okay
where you going
youre sposta be over here with the toys
with the toys
ill get this
you can pull yourself up on anything huh
you dont know yes yes yes
are you all done
all done
all done
good job yay
yay look at you
youre like yay im all done
glad you just noticed them right now
great timing
okay well just end it with it on that note
okay okay
basically this is the last ah
i guess ill do the questions now
yeah i think hes just making a break for it
okay so we just have a few questions
-um i wasnt with you the fir the previous two times bes so i dont know which toys was he most interested in
-uh still the food
likes the food toys
were there any food items in particular
not so much
i mean he because he consistently seems to go for the peas
i dont know if its the color of the texture
-uh but thats consistent
-uh the spoons he spent the most time with
i think that he likes the rattling noise
-uh last time
no this is the first time hes really been and hes you know seems specifically drawn to them
-uh hes always kind of gone to this one because hes got one of these at home
or one like this at home
-um hell reach for the books but then he loses interest in the books
-um and thats pretty consistent
this is probably the most hes tried to eat all the toys
all of the toys but -uh its
yeah y were talking about you
the the bear the spoons and the food seem to be
and what about the items that he seemed the least interested in
-um he didnt seem to much go for too many of the stuffed guys
well the other stuff guys
i mean i i dont know if he remembered him or or what the the yellow and black striped
completely no interest in like the bottles
or the
or any of those
but -uh
was that the same last time
i think he associates reading with bedtime
because i read to him at night and then i put him down
and then if we try to read during the day hes like oh no
i know what youre doing
so he doesnt seem to be a fan
hes a little bit more receptive about it at night
what about the stuffed animals since the last time
-um stuffed animals n the nothing specifically
keep hitting your head
nothing but the pooh bear
do you think he recognizes names for any of these items
-um i usually call them your friend
you know do you wanna bring your friend with you your friend
and so if hes holding them so i dont know if he knows that pooh is pooh and
you know i dont think he can differentiate between th i just call them this is your friend you know
so i i give it sort of a generic name
what about the food items
do you think hes starting to recognize some of the food
its possible
his peas dont look this
so i find it interesting that hes very fascinated by them
-um so and and ive never given him waffles ive given him bread
his bread doesnt even look like this
so i mean you know by the time he gets it its the chopped up into little pieces so
i i i dont think so i im thinking its either the color or the texture hes attracted to
so and of course the hes never in life had one of these
he was kind of into the shake
and do you have any of these toys or similar ones at home
no just the pooh
-um what about the books
you said that you read to him at night
do you have any of these
we only have good night moon
-uh thats the only one that
that we have
and good night moon he he usually i think its just because its long
hes like alright are we asleep yet
-um do you play with pretend food at home
-uh no
so if you were asked if he prefers books over toys or toys over books
id say toys over books
okay i think
and the animals youre saying he doesnt
some kids are really fascinated by animals very early on
-uh we have two dogs at home so i think you know
the stuffed ones are
you know hes like ah i got a live one
thats okay
sounds good well i think thats all we have for now
you did really good
now well you get to pick a toy to take home before i forget
wanna pick your own toy
wanna pick your own toy
i wanna heart
probably take that microphone off
you okay
yeah i am so its caught in my hair
youre getting ready to walk huh
working on it
yeah wont be long
the theme for today is things i can put in my mouth and chew
okay so i just wanna ask you some questions about what you did
-um i noticed you playing a lot with the food
which items did he -uh like
oh well he was eating the peas this main spaghetti
-um theres one that has the meat sauce but he wasnt playing so much with that one
and then the pizza
and but the peas and the spaghetti seem to be his favorite
and do you remember which of the dessert items you might have showed him
i showed him this but he didnt seem real interested in the dessert
i showed him the icecream cone too
and he didnt
now he does
but he didnt want it before
thats pretty much what he
how about this one joe bch
oh he did pick the cookie up
he did find the cookie on his own and he did eat the cookie
huh there you go with the bch
you know how to make it go in your mouth bch
but yeah then he went for the clock and then
but he did play with the baby for a little bit
and he did pick up the the sippy cup
which is weird because he doesnt drink out of one
he doesnt drink out of them
he he wont drink out of it
he prefers a cup if hes
does he not like sugary things
he -um he gets one bottle of juice a day but he -um he drinks mostly out of a bottle or a cup now he he just wont drink out of a sippy
hell chew the tip of the sippy cup but he wont eat drink out of it
and then they all fell out and they gotta go in again
thats right
but yeah he played with the baby for a little bit gave the baby a hug
so but but yeah i i showed him the sheep and the frog and the the pooh bear and -uh the this one and he wasnt interested in the stuffed animals today
do you remember what you told him that was i know some people get confused
oh with this
the otter
yeah i think some people get confused about it
yep nope i said otter and he just kinda looked at like whatever
and the frog youre like whatever
hes like i got my food and things i can stick in my mouth and bite stuff
does he know about utensils and things like that
he does
and i handed him a spoon and he thats right what did he
where did i put it
here it is
he went like that which is what he usually does
he he uses the wrong end usually
but he didnt put it in his mouth
-uh do you remember if there are other foods you showed him
that he might recognize from home
i he was trying to eat the toast
but i made a sandwich and he was -uh would take the piece of toast
is what he would take
each time
and every time i put something on the plate he would take it right off which is what he does at home so
you dump everything huh bch
dump everything onto your tray so you can pick it apart bch
does he know which foods are for breakfast and which for foods are for
i dont think so
theyre all the same to you huh
yeah hes just like stuff to eat but he really likes the peas
how about this one you like this one bch
yeah bch
yeah because i showed him
you chew on this one bch
i showed him that and was like yeah thats what your brothers eat for breakfast but he didnt seem to really care at the time
but now its just lets put everything in our mouth and chew
-uh what what all else did he put in his mouth
that was pretty
that was pretty much it
he played a little bit with the keys but not very much
i guess it doesnt have the same clanging sound as as car keys so
yeah the real ones
mommys keys they make a cool sound bch
but every time i put the pizza all six slices back into a pie he would take at least two of them out so
but yeah he didnt seem to really
hes really really into the peas and the spaghetti
you wait three years from now you wont wanna touch those bch
which is weird because he went
thank you bch
he ate before we came
and he had a lot of food too
thank you bch
oh thank you bch
hes like what you doing
is that a piece of paper
can i play with it
do you remember if you showed him any other animals
no it was pooh bear and these
oh i tried to show him the bee
but he was
you werent having that were you
no he did not wanna look at the bee and the sheep
yeah go open some foods bch
he goes ah the wires
its the other fun thing to play with at home huh bch
yes bch
well i think that about does it joseph bch
you were really good today bch
yep bch
yeah baby has shoes bch
yep thats what you do with your shoes too huh bch
do you eat your shoes too bch
yes he does
i think well have him stop
just ask
you get to keep playing
i dont know if you can remember this is your
third already
which of
which of these toys did he seem interested in -um
this time
-uh he likes the
the spoons
the measuring spoons and the cup
and the
the bottle over there
he seems more interested in these two now
then before
this soft
stuffed animals
thats a chicken
why do you think that these
-um interest him
i think
the cup
and the spoon
and the bottle
cause hes drinking on his own now
so maybe
just the fact that he can do it on his own and
he does it
and hes teething
he likes to put stuff in his mouth
what about
which group do you think hes least
interested in
maybe the books
he didnt really touch them
i hadta like bring one over to him
and -uh
so the books
do you guys read
books at home
we try to at least
at least once a day
but at home hes always like
playing with them even if i dont read it to him
he always has a book and hes flipping through it
so maybe
the other toys are new
so ha
so would you say hes still
into toys more
the toy
oh does he
does he like
prefer books or the toys
-uh huh
do you
do you think he recognizes any of the animals
or the names of
does he know
maybe yeah dog
he says dog a lot
and we have a dog
whenever we have a
whenever the dog barks he says
not exactly dog
but you know
as much as he can
i think thats his main
animal right now ha dog ha
what about the foods
the food
recognize any
not really
i dont think so
maybe just the drinks inside the cup
i mean
he knows what its for that theres
something inside
to drink
-um but we dont like eat ice cream on a cone
i guess usually in a cup so
and the cheese i usually like
tear it up for him
so it doesnt look like this to him
the same with like the bread
he doesnt see these
this food in this whole form
its usually like chopped or
pureed so
thank you this is pizza
what about dolls
i guess
how many dolls or i guess he wouldnt have haha
yeah his sister does so
he plays with dolls at home
so he knows what dolls are
what is this
that may be a beaver
pretend food at
you do okay
okay i think thats it
unless is there anything else
you wanna add or talk about
about the way he plays at home
not really no
i can think of
this is a kangaroo
haha you wanna kiss him
thank you
okay yup
lets go get your sister
-um did you notice anything different from what she plays with this time from last time
no i dont think she really played with much
kinda wandered around and did her thing
please dont rip that off bch
last time were there some things that
what was her favorite thing
last time you were here
she always goes to the food i mean like the sippycup
she took the sippycup she took the cookie and she took the bottle and tried to eat and drink out of them
-um and i think thats been pretty consistent with her
-um last time she played a little bit with the stuffed animals this time she kind of went through them and then threw them to the side
do you think there were any stuffed animals that she played with that she recognized the names of
-um i dont think so yet
or if she does nothing that i i noticed
okay so everything was kind of like new new names or
i mean she you know she picked up the fox and i dont know if the fox looks a little like her cat
oh okay
but that was when she was going through thats who she went to grab
yes thank you bch
so like familiar face colors
-um what about you said the food do you think she knows the names of some of the food
i think the cookies and the bottle and the sippycup and the juice yeah
okay these are more familiar to her
did you guys play with books this time
i tried she played a little bit and she looked through it but not not as much i mean
usually at home shell grab a book and walk around and sounds like shes trying to read it but
she didnt really play too much with the books
she i have no idea if she likes the colors of this or what but this she grabbed
do you think she knows the name
of the clock
probably not
okay yeah it could be color
shed no interest in the baby
did you try to play with the baby
i tried to get her to feed the baby and no interest in the baby
do you have baby dolls at home
she does have a two some shell walk around with them
she just carries them is she is that how she plays with them
yeah shell just carry them right now -um
she you know sometimes looks like shes going to give the baby a kiss or a hug but
i dont know if she really is or
amira bch
the only things she says is she says daddy and then she calls cat jazzy
and then otherwise its nonsense words
okay great
theres nothing in there for you to drink bch
i thought there were some words that you were working on
trying you know like when she gives me something ill say thank you and shell mumble but she doesnt say thank you back shell just mumble
like you know like a two second something back so just trying to get her to at least be familiar with the words
but no actual formed words really
its still pretty much baby
hold on bch
-um so you said the animals that names werent familiar was the fox it was like just the look
i wonder if it was just the look yeah
im not sure she knows
do you play games like patty cake or
she plays patty cake and will play -um like ill chase her or ill hide and well creep up on each other
okay do you say boo or peekaboo or
ill do you know like ill come up and say boo or you know like she knows im coming and shell jump like shes scared
even though she sees me running towards her
thank you bch
thank you bch
thank you bch
you cant drink out of that though baby bch
-uh what kind of books at home do do you have
she has the hard cover of these little books and what she really likes that ive been buying her are popup books
so i have -um a bunch that are just you know in the jungle in the ocean
shell sit and go through the popup books
so i thought i could get her to do this one because its you know kind of interactive
but not really
she wasnt
super interested
no but her popup books she loves
has she been eating -uh food
like solid food
any of the ones that were here
shell eat like the greens i mean she picked up the peas
she eats a lot of green veggies
-um and then like pancakes and she picked up the waffle like shell do pancakes and crackers and you know any type of bread stuff like that
okay and is she familiar with winnie the pooh
im not sure -um no i dont think so not yet
she doesnt watch winnie the pooh or anything like that
no winnie the pooh yet
right bch
what was her least favorite thing
here today
im gonna have to say the doll
how much time do you think do you spend playing with the doll
like i said she wouldnt even play with it i picked it up and tried to get her interact and she had no interest
mhm and then her favorite thing
im gonna say the sippycup
she walked around with that and oh the little clock not that she knew how to play with it
she walked around
but the sippycup she kept trying to drink out of
what are -um like the characteristics of toys that she really likes at home
now shes getting into the stage where she you know like has -um like
the little animal doll characters then they have their vehicles and a train and shell sit and shell actually drive you know like start to push them around and drive them then the ball that she plays with
that shell throw around or kick
okay so more active toys
i dont see her do any roleplaying yet
i mean shes back and forth all over with toys
the -uh animal the animal farm toys you bought that just before your second visit
yeah ive been collecting them for a while
oh okay
and before she wouldnt really do anything with them like she would walk around with them if shed want them but now i noticed shes started to put them in the little vehicles and push the vehicles around
thats cool
so starting to get there
so things that are more immobile do you think shes attracted to things for color or touch or like texture
-um or sound like what
she likes music she dances she has some toys like that will play music and shell play with those
she loves music and dance
shell stop what shes doing if you know a commercial comes on with a little jingle to go over to it and dance
you cant eat that either baby bch
well you know it looks like food bch
youre funny bch
youre funny bch
well thank you so much for coming in today
no problem
can you put your shoes on bch
and working with us as far as with the schedule
what interested her
well you know every time we come here
she always grabs that bottle
oh so she remembers the bottle
but i think its because it is a bottle
you know
-um that she gravitates towards that
and then like all the food toys this time she was putting in her mouth
-um like in the first thing she picked up when we came in was the peas
and last time she was attracted to the peas as well
this time i showed her to clap the blocks
to she saw that it made a sound
you like that
so then she was doing it
and then with the circular cylinder shaped blocks
but then she picked up the pizza and she noticed there was more pizza over there so she went to go get all of them
oh okay
and then she started to shh tap the pizza together to see if she could make the sound with the pizza but
you know its like she saw it like made a beeline for it and then came back and then she looked and saw that there was more so -um
all of the food stuff
the waffle she put in her mouth
the icecream i said because her sister just had an icecream cone
oh okay
and so maybe you know she recognized that
i said icecream and she went to go put it in her mouth
-um we took tried to take the real icecream away from her and she had a fit
so maybe she remembered you know the icecream experience from the other day
she still eating it
this one is
joke and say its her favorite toy because she hates this thing
i mean like
it is so funny the reaction she gives when like she thinks
but then she was getting brave today
she came and sat on me and she actually pulled it
oh okay
but then when i go to put it next to her she makes a fit
she doesnt like it
does she know what thats called
a bee
i dont know if she knows a bee
no i think what it is these things
oh okay
they look alive
she doesnt like it
we have a kooshball at home too that she does not like
and her sister doesnt
i play tricks on both of them and put it ne close to them
they realize its there and they take off running
but this thing right here is not her favorite
clearly its not her favorite
and clearly she doesnt like
because she even jumps if it she thinks its co going to her
you see her face
shes like get that thing away from me
she doesnt like it
she likes that
the sp well she just picked the spoon up
the whole time she didnt
even the measuring spoons
and then i use these too when cooking you know so
so she knows it
she probably yeah its like whatever theyre just spoons
but -um i just noticed this time
last time i was trying to get her to clap the blocks and she didnt do it
but this time i did it and she wanted to do it as well so she liked the blocks
and you know she plays with the babies
we have several babies at home
different ethnicity -uh babies as well
and she just throws them about
i mean you know its no big love affair that she has with the babies
but and then a plethora of stuffed animals so maybe the stuffed animals -um she so too familiar with them shes like oh i can play with those at home i dont wanna play with those
i these food type blocks and toys and -um she does have a play bottle at home its muc its a little smaller than that one
and she does the same thing
she puts it straight to her mouth like shes gonna feed herself
-um and of course she sees this and automatically knows its a cup
and im trying to stop her from breastfeeding now
but -um shes been taken more to the bottle and to cups
and she wants to drink out of what you have
so maybe this is because even though its smaller and its clearly a toy
maybe shes familiar with it you know from home from drinking out of it at home
was there anything else that she liked to play with
it looked like she preferred the toys over the books
she de we tried to get her like to look at the books even the peekaboo book which the last time she at least i could get her to look and then for a quick you know couple of seconds
but this time she didnt even wanna look at it
she wasnt even bothered
but it looked like help me turn the pages of this book here
but then she got bored really quickly
and its crazy because we read books everyday at home
and not little books but like big picture books and you know
and things like that
she enjoys sitting
and i dont know maybe its because of -uh her sister
we have a three year old at home
so -um and micah is definitely trying to learn how to read
but -uh and quinn because she just is trying to emulate her sister
maybe its why
but here by herself i dont wanna read any books i wanna play with the toys
are you finished
are you done
you wanna play with the microphone
thats not a toy though
i dont think i have any more questions for you
i think youre all done
ready to go
ready to go
oh and the keys i didnt mention
she wouldnt put the bottle down for the longest until i gave her the keys
and then she dropped the bottle to play with the keys
but she loves keys
you love keys
youll be driving soon
no you can wait for that
thank you for coming in today
thank you
good luck with your studies
okay over there
yeah hes fine
be careful mister
yeah hes
-um which group of toys did he seem to like
the food
the food
oh okay
what about the least
-um the stuffed animals
and i dont know if you remember
but do you think that changed
the last time he also liked the toys
and i
or the food
and i think it hasta do with the fact that its -um the easiest for him to chew on because hes teething like he was last time
so the last time he chose the pea
like i just think the shape of them
its easy for him to hold and to gnaw on
because i know he doesnt know what spaghetti
i mean im pretty sure he doesnt know what spaghetti is
hes never had spaghetti so
ah did he go to the books at all
he didnt
-um i mean i tried to read them to him
i think
at home we read a lot
-um ive been surprised that when were here hes not interested in the books
but it might just be because theres other toys here that hes not familiar with
-um do you guys have any of these at home
-um we have the put me in the zoo
we have the regular good night moon
not good night moon one two three
this book -um grandma has at her house
-um does he have similar toys at home
-um i mean he has books
he has stuffed animals
he doesnt have any food toys
-um no
although the one thing i was surprised by was that he picked this up and tried to drink outta it
because were transitioning him to a bottle at night before bed
and so it took him a long time to get adjusted to that
but now he obviously knows what it is because he was trying to get the liquid out haha
okay haha
-um so you said he l
what do you doing
toys or books that ah he likes
at home i would say hed prefers his toys
-um i mean we generally use books kind of as a wind-down thing before naptime or bedtime
what do you doing with the peas
you said he never had spaghetti before
would he recognize any of the other foods
i mean im not sure because when he gets peas we give him like three or four peas at a time
and thats not really what this looks like
so im not k completely sure
he eats cheese all the time
but again we give it to him in little tiny pieces
-um so im not sure that he would associate this with a piece of cheese
-um obviously he did know what the s
well i think he knew what the spoon was
although he tried to brush his hair with it
-um you know it seemed like he knew that the spoon went in his mouth
but for the most part all of the food he gets at this point is still cut up into little
waffles too
i mean ive given him waffles before
but it comes out of the toaster
and i cut it up
and then i give him three pieces at a time
so i dont know that he knows that this is what hes eating
okay right haha
ah would he recognize any of the animals
do you think
huh -um i mean he knows dogs
but im not sure that he knew that this was a dog
im not sure i would know thats a dog
kinda like a cat
so that would probably be the one
hes really into mice these days
but i dont think theres any mice here
so no probably not
oop im sorry
did you lose the peas
okay i think that should be
is there anything else the way he plays at home that you wanna tell us
-um whoa
no i mean th his favorite thing these days and probably for the last month or two has been a ball
and so im sure if there was a ball in the mix thats what he wouldve been obsessed with the whole time
okay -um i think thats it then
what do you doing buddy
is it okay if i ask you some questions
-um so -uh tell me about what you guys played with
-um he was really interested in the food
hes still teething so its everything in his mouth chewing on everything
-um he doesnt eat -um a lot of solids yet still so like he doesnt know like this is pizza thats icecream or anything yet
but -um
yeah bch
but he definitely -um is interested in self feeding with a spoon so he was into the spoons and tried to you know imitate feeding himself and with the bottle and the sippycup
-um so yeah he was into those
hes still not really into the stuffed animals because they dont do anything for him
-um and then the baby he was into a little bit
and the peekaboo book
whos got you bch
yeah see if you can play with that bch
thats really fun bch
theyre magnets just like on the fridge bch
hes like no
-um yeah so still i think last time i said oh he likes things that make noise hes still into -um anything that makes or he can teethe on
and his new skill seems to be throwing things so he threw a few things
-um and since i mean he doesnt really know like frozen peas or tacos or anything so i was using these as blocks to build a tower for him to knock down because he likes to do that at home we have like -um solo cups that we stack up and nest and everything and he likes that
thats the babys face bch
yeah you gonna get her bch
be gentle bch
or -um i think i noticed he was playing actually with the bottle a lot
yeah he was playing with the bottle
he occasionally takes a bottle at home and a sippycup at home too
so that was kind of -um
theres the teething
-um so i think he was like oh bottle you know sippycup
i know those things
what does he usually get in them
-um in the bottle its breast milk and the sippycup is water
so he is not familiar with juice he hasnt had juice
-um the reason why hes been slow on solids is because we think he has food allergies so
thats why hes like not so familiar with all that stuff
were there any like food names that maybe you say at home or youre trying to teach him or
-um he probably is familiar with the words icecream
my mother in-law says -um daddy come home bring john an icecream cone kinda like a rhyme
-um but he wouldnt associate that well with icecream cone necessarily i dont think
-um because dairy is one of the things that we think he has a sensitivity to so
-um apple he may recognize apples because there was apple juice
-um he gets apple sauce at home
-um but everything else we havent really worked on like food words because hes not really getting a lot of food
but the peas
i think he really liked their texture
youre just cracking yourself up over there bch
-um yeah i think he liked the texture
-uh hes had pee puree before but he wouldnt necessarily look at this and say oh thats peas you know
because its been a puree
and then -um what about the
i can get it
the baby
how did you guys play with the baby
-um hes really interested in shoes and socks lately
so i tried to -um
and i always point out babies when we seem them
so -um i tried to get him interested in the shoe and the baby
oh okay
yeah bch
oh is the baby having an icecream cone bch
whoops bch
hi there bch
so you talk about like body parts and clothing
yeah -um yeah
im teach trying to teach him like nose head hair that kinda thing
shoe yeah bch
you like to show off shoes when you find them bch
you really like shoes and socks bch
do you think he knows that word
i think so
because -um hes always going to them at home and showing them to me or pointing to them
and typically when hes doing hes familiar with it
you know what i mean like
oh no
-um good boy bch
wanna come here bch
come get the baby bch
yes bch
the baby wants to give you a hug bch
-um yeah whats that a pitcher bch
-um yeah like his hats he loves hats and
no no no bch
come here bch
come back here bch
yes bch
good boy bch
oh yeah whats that bch
pizza bch
-um yeah so things that he is trying to show me or you know calling my attention to i think are things that hes done in the past a lot
and hes he knows okay this is something ive seen before you know
its a sock or a shoe
wow bch
and then -um you said body parts
which ones do you think hes more fascinated with or youve been working on with him
he likes noses
-um face
-um and then feet and hands and fingers
-um and tongue
i didnt say any of those things i i dont remember saying that
but -um you know those are the things
oh hes going for it
hey john bch
aha bch
your socks coming off too bch
come on lets go over here bch
here we go bch
were there any -um any of the books that you played with or
-um yeah we played with the peekaboo book because thats his favorite game i mean hes always
like sometimes hell like if were in my room at home well hell crawl around the bed and kinda like lean
like when whenever he does this motion i know hes like trying to do peekaboo whether somethings in front of him or not
he gets this look on his face
-um yeah thats his favorite so i thought he might like that the you know hide and seek book
of course it didnt hold his ten attention for very long when there were things to chew on
but -um
yeah i think we have this book at home we havent looked at it too much but
oh maybe not
baby animals is something that we have
-um i thought maybe id show him something that we didnt have at at home
how about the -um stuffed animals
does he recognize
he we have a larger version of that be winnie the pooh
-um he doesnt play with it
he really isnt very into stuffed animals
special surprise
special delivery
-um hes not really into stuffed animals all that much
so i kept like trying to find something that hed be interested in
like we have a dog at home so hes very familiar with the word dog and puppy and all that
and so there was a little chihuahua here
the chihuahua i was trying to -um show him to get him interested in but again its it doesnt you know do anything interesting and he cant really bite it very well i dont think
thats kind of
and i think you played with the waffles too
did you say
he doesnt know what they are
but he i think he threw one or somthing i cant remember exactly what he did with it so
hi bch
you got me bch
you got me bch
aw bch
yes bch
and then -um you have a nick name for him
yeah coop
our last name is cooper so i call him coop sometimes
and -um i actually probably call him coop more often than not but -um i intersperse john and coop
whered your sock go bch
thats not the babys bch
thats not for babies bch
but youre interested in it bch
interested in it bch
oh his socks all the way on the other side of the room
okay well i think thats all the questions i have
i hope that was useful
it was
lets put your sock on bch
where does your sock go on your feet bch
what were some of the things that she liked to play with today
the doll
say the doll and this kangaroo bch
is it similar to things that she played with last time
-uh no you didnt have the doll last time
she was normally playing with the food last time
-um or she normally picks up the food like this and things that she knows
-um and the little creatures
she played with the doll more or less today
what kinds of things was she doing
is the doll new for her
the doll is new for her
she was pointing to the eyes the nose the mouth
being a little mean to her like michael is to her you know
so i think she thought it was a baby
you could tell she thought it was a little person
-um no thats a
oh you found your piggy bch
good bch
thats bologna bch
bad piece of bologna but bologna
and shes more active today than she was last time
how so just
in terms of asking what things are
you know shes like pointing to them whats this picking it up talking more
i think last time she was rather quiet if im not mistaken
i wasnt in -um with you last time i was
yeah i think she was a little more quieter
-um just kinda sorta picking things up thinking that it was food
why isnt this food
you know this is hard
but she knew what they were
say thank you bch
what are -um some of the things that you think she did recognize this time just by
well whats this bch
say say cookie bch
mckayla eat your cookie bch
like she knows
wait wheres the juice box
like she knows the cup youre sposta drink out of it
shell try to drink out of it
-um she thinks thats a cup
yeah so shes trying to suck it you know and its not working properly
this is peanut butter bch
its not even a cup bch
-um she kinda sorta knows what youre sposta do with the different things
you want some food bch
there you go bch
she tried to feed the bread to the baby
-um yeah but she didnt really play with too much more than that
-um did she show any interest in any of the animals or where there any that you thought
just the zebra
she knows what a zebra is
all the
well she knows what some of the toys are like the dog
she knows what some of the toys but she doesnt
she has a lot of stuffed animals at home
sometimes she plays with them sometimes she dont
she plays with more blocks and trucks and whatever her brother plays with
computers and
she never ventured that far out the circle
i know im talking right bch
i took mommys attention didnt i bch
shes like hey
and those wires are looking mighty tempting bch
what are you doing bch
what happened bch
i do not know bch
why you breathing hard kayla bch
kayla bch
say i dont know bch
i do not know bch
-um how about books did you guys -um
we read half of the foot book
same that we read last time
is so do you have that book at home
i dont have doctor seuss at home i have a lot of the other books
like goodnight moon
i have this one
-um she normally goes and picks up a book that she wants read
if she doesnt pick it up she she normally does pay attention but its gotta be kinda interesting
this one she was more
she wanted to kinda smash the book lately
there you go bch
there you go bch
you did it all by yourself bch
i dont want it bch
thats a bch
thats a bird bch
see bch
no its not its an eagle bch
exactly its an eagle bch
here bch
take him bch
take him bch
take him bch
thats pizza bch
mm bch
pizza kayla bch
see she knows what foods are
say this dont taste like no pizza mommy thats nasty bch
pizza bch
-um just in reda regards to the foot book im sorry
does she know the word foot and the plural feet
does she know those
she knows what feet are i do not know if she knows what a foot is
but she knows what feet hands -um fingers
shes telling you im gonna do it anyway
-um eyes mouth -um
no dont eat that bch
she knows
we do clean the toys
oh you do
because im not sure
im like theyre so dirty
-um she knows quite a bit
she knows bottle
cup juice milk
you want a cookie kayla bch
how was she
she knows dance
how was she what
-um play with the food
how or how were you both playing it or how does she play with it at home
well we she doesnt play with the food at home
thats the whole thing
so to her if you see food you eat it
she doesnt
i would not do that to no child thats just wrong
thats wrong
i just dont under
they have regular food i dont have food toys at home
well because she eats a variety so shes end up knowing what these different meats are
just because theyre normally in her plate
thats probably why she picks them up
they get pizza and bread and
and you tell them what the real thing is when you get it so
shes like i wanna eat it
you cant eat it no no bch
nope thats just as fake as the other piece you picked up bch
yay bch
okay bch
least favorite
see she
say all this fake stuff mommy this is so rude bch
its fake kayla bch
you gotta get this bch
she know youre looking at her now
-um i dont think she has a least favorite
i do not know shes just exploring i dont know if shes not not liked anything
give me that bottle bch
is it good bch
say i dont taste anything bch
its juice bch
so what is the purpose of this one
this study were actually just trying to get -um so see the childrens babble over time
as their language are changing and how theyre responding to the different toys
so we use the same set of toys over and over again
so we kind of compare -um like each child amongst themselves over time
and see how theyre developing and if their speech pattern kinda changes
-um and then the next visit after this one the two year visit we actually do articulation and speech and language testing
-um and we see if like that trend that development has anything to do -um the way this child developed and the next child developed and those types of things
oh okay
so well have over a hundred fifty kids at the termination of the project
to see some of the kids -um have been coming back with like speech and language difficulties and see if theres anything early on based on the laboratory skills that were doing in there as well as the babbling that were seeing in here and the way that theyre playing really interacting with the toys
if theres something early on that we can see that points to -um a learning
a learning disability
right a learning disability
oh okay that makes sense
no with mckayla -um shes much more active today than she was last time
see last time she stayed within the circle
its a whole lot messier now than it was last time
she kinda stayed exactly where you put her last time
yeah a lot of that bch
okay bch
you can have the stand bch
okay bch
so i think were actually done
-um at talking about what we played with today so im gonna stop it
because shes getting really interested in it
as you can see she branched outside of the toys and went to the real stuff and thats what she does at home
so i have the same round of questions
that i have to read as last time
-um one of the first things we like to ask is if you remember what she played with last time
-um did you notice any changes
-um i think she might have remembered some of these
-um because i could just tell by her reactions
yeah it seemed like especially the bee
-um but maybe she was a little more -um maybe because she was like a little f familiar with the area and the toys
like she was like going out and grabbing them on her own
-um whereas before i was like handing them to her i think
were there any specific ones that you found she played with now and not last time
last time
ah no i dont think so
i remember last time she played with the animals and the food
and that seemed to be what she was interested in this time also
although actually the spoons and the keys
i dont know if the spoons were here last time
but the keys were here last time
and she was having a lot more fun with these today
ah how about books here and at home
her attention span isnt really -um
we have trouble getting through a full book with her
-um yeah i could tell
i think books were at the bottom of her list today
theres just too much other stuff for her to look at
im sorry do you have any of the books at home
these books
yeah we do
we do have some of these books
but i dont know if shes ever
i dont think weve gone over these particular ones with her
with her sister we have
but -um yeah we dont have any of these exact ones
that weve gone over with her
like her books generally are -um like
because these are a little bit more advanced
i dont know her books the ones have at home are like four pages long
the inflatable or like the touching
-um yeah we have an inflatable one that she likes
but theyre also cardboard
just like real quick with you know like an animal on each page or something
-um not where you have to read multiple words
thats when she starts to lose -um lose focus on the book
do you think -um shed recognize any of the names of the animals today
ah maybe
i think she kind of knows dog
because we have our dog
-um and like like woof
she knows to associate with the dog
-um but i think she remembered the bee
for sure
-um but i dont know about like names of the animals
maybe the bee
probably more the sounds though that i make with him
i was doing that with her last time
she seemed to remember that
and i -um noticed that a couple times rather than saying dog you used either the type of dog or a dog name
oh yeah the dogs name
yeah our dogs name tasmin
so ive been going over like tasmins a dog
and he says woof
so i was trying to get her to kind of although -um
tasmin doesnt look like either of these dogs
but my parents
who she sees my parents a few times a week
they have a poodle
not a pink poodle but haha
-um named frio
so i was thinking maybe shed get that out of this
but i dont know
probably not
so and the bear
the bear
yeah -um i dont know if she really knows who winnie the pooh is
but we went to disneyworld in march
and we saw lots of winnie the pooh there
but i doubt if she remembers that
do you have stuffed animals at home
lots of animals at home
how do you usually play with them at home
-um same thing
just like like you know rubbing them against her and ticking her
so shh shes a big fan of the stuffed animals and hugging them
and -um the play food that seemed to be
the play food shell just wanna eat
she really likes to eat
so anything that looks like cooking food shes going to test it out
ah so i think she you know doesnt know the difference between pretend food and real food
-um but pretty much the food we feed her at home is cut up into small pieces
so i dont think she would make the association between what shes eaten and the play food
that makes sense
is there anything that would be
i know last time you said she loves everything
is there a favorite food here
honestly she would eat any of this
ah she does like noodles
either noodles or cheese
out of whats here would probably be her favorite
although shed quickly eat up anything else
you said you didnt have play food at home
yeah we do
how do you play with that usually
ah well its pretty much just in her sisters play kitchen
shell just go over to the kitchen and pull it out and chew on it
and so yeah we dont really play with her with the food
she just kind of gets it out herself
you use it to like feed the animals or
oh yeah
ah she does
i dont know if she really understood that
she does like to take whatever shes eating and put it to my mouth
and she likes me to pretend that im eating her food
well she thinks im eating it but
okay isabelle off the chords
your favorite thing here
yeah oh what is that
speaking of that what do you think was her favorite thing today
either the bee or the dogs
those seemed to really entertain her for a while
just had lots of hugs for the dogs
i think she likes the texture of this
its like a different rubbery texture
oh thats good
do you think that gets her a lot
yeah the textures and also the colors
i think this has some you know bright colors and contrast to it
and the sounds
yeah definitely yeah sounds
and i feel like she knew what to do with the spoon
she was putting that right in her mouth
although you know well feed her
but well give her a spoon to play with
and she tries to pick up the food with the spoon and put it in her mouth
okay and do you think
you said you think she recognized the bee but -um
but do you think she would recognize the names
as in if you said it out loud she would look at it or know what youre talking about
maybe the dogs
oh isabelle
-um i think maybe dogs she might do the association
but i dont think anything else she would really
i mean i guess shes heard the words before
but i dont think she could put two and two together
what do you think is the thing she liked the least
probably the baby doll
yeah isabelle
yeah i know
come on
and how do you usually deal with you know if she is disinterested in something
how do you get her to come back to you
to get back to that
-um usually have to like pick her up
and you know whatever shes
youre okay
put her in a new environment almost
so she cant see
i know
you can see it
i know
you can see it
so you wanna go right for it
i know
i know you love the chords
alright well i think shes ready
oh boy yeah
oh no
come on
come on sweetie
oh boy
so vocal
yeah haha come on mom
yeah at some point
some point well get there
is it okay if i start asking you some questions
did you -um notice anything different this time since the last time
yeah last time she liked this thing a lot
-um i think because of the plastic nastiness on its head
and -um i tried to like see if like she would remember it
and she really wanted to have nothing to do with that
she was really into the plates this time
like she kept going back for them no matter
if i gave her a toy or she picked up another toy she always went back to those
so and shes a lot more bouncy i guess this time
like she ah shes getting into it more i think
so you think the plates were the number one
favorite today
ah what were some other things that she played with
-um i th
dont eat that
-um i think like the spoons and the keys too
i think its the plastic sound
like the sound of plastic
because -um like she picked up the deer and a couple other things
but they were just quick like oh okay im done with that
so its more noise than texture
what are some -um things
do you play with these similar
is that what shes doing at home as well
yeah -um we have like a set of those keys at home that she plays with
and she has a lot of sound toys
like she has a little keyboard
and -um she has like a set of keys that have like an alarm button on them
-um that makes noise
and ah she likes playing with the noise toys
more at home too
things that make noise
does she not play with stuffed animals at home
or does she have stuffed animals at home
she has them
she usually sleeps with them more than she plays with them
like she has a stuffed bunny that she cant go to sleep without
-um like she has a couple things like during the day that ill -um like give to her
but she doesnt really seem to play with them
she usually plays with books a lot when shes at home
and when i tried to give her the books here she wouldnt really
-um we have good night moon
but it isnt the counting version
so -um like when i flipped to this page she kind of like kind of perked up
because its the same as the good night moon book
but i dont think we have any of these other books
how about foods
no we didnt
but we might have to
ah do you think she recognized the names of any of the items she played with today
-um probably not
like we dont have any pretend food
and shes still eating just like oatmeal
and bottle so -um
-um but -um i dont think we have any animals like these
like we have the typical bears and bunnies
so -um she might have recognized book or baby
she didnt wanna have anything to do with the baby either
-um yeah she has -um a baby doll that she plays with
and i only bring it out every once in a while because its like almost as big as her
when i do she wants nothing to do with anything but that baby
tough work huh
does she usually play with the baby alone
what kinds of activities does she
she just yaps at it
and like -um shell give it like hugs and stuff
but she doesnt really -um like associate anything with the baby just yet
-um so
i mean she likes to toss it around too
unfortunately haha
at home do you play any added activities
like at this age i always give the example of pattycake
but of course that sounds funny
like you know like those types of activities where you just engage with not really any toys
-um we havent mastered pattycake
she does peekaboo
and -um like for a few months its been us going peekaboo
but just the other day she started to do it herself
like she pulled up her blanket
and then when i say
wheres masie
shed pull it back down and start giggling
and -um but she does that
she does so big sometimes
only when she really feels like it
haha but its nice
actually quite normal
but those are th really the only two that i can think of
she likes to do that too
and like if we do it back
like make the same noise she made
shell make it again
we do that too
shes well on her way
okay so at this point its been about fifteen minutes
so now im just gonna ask you a few questions
-um im not gonna write down anything cause it will all be on the recorder
so the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most
the food
the food
which do you think is a good toy for her personality
among the food choice or just
in general
-um i i think the food toys are good for her cause she likes doing stuff that she sees us do
she tries to do everything
but she sees us do
which is why it doesnt surprise me at all where when she played with the microphone first its like tv remotes
cell phones palm pilots its like oh mommy and daddy are playing with those
that makes sense
so and food is obviously something we spend a lot of time with
which of the toys seemed to interest her the least
oh she didnt even look at the baby doll
or oh she didnt notice the books either did i
that whole bin
that whole bin in general
why do you think that is
i cant tell you for sure she may simply not have noticed them
she was right by the stuffed animals when we put her down
and then she saw the food and didnt seem to look up again after that
so im not sure if theres anything uninteresting here
although ive noticed in the last couple months that shes definitely not into books when i do try to read to her she closes them
and i think thats more just lack of you know motor control
but its hard to finish a story so she doesnt know how cool stories can be
we havent read a whole lot or havent finished a whole lot of books
-um okay
do you think that there are any items that her interests have changed in since the last time you were here
i dont think so i remember playing with the food a lot
i think she was a little more into books then
mostly cause i think she havent learned how to close them yet
im looking forward to reading to her again but
were definitely in a stage where thats not working
so so shes less interested in books than she was
okay and more interested in the food you would say
probably equally maybe a little more
-um the next question is about books
book would your child prefer to read or look at
she likes anything
that has a good rhythm to it
like i remember mister brown can move
from last time and
at home -um
-uh im not even remembering which books go over better
nothings going well right now as i already said twice
-um but if its a story
mhm interesting
but if its something that has more of a rhythm she
she likes that
more interesting
does she play with similar toys at home
she really likes big toys at this point like pushing her little tigger plane around
or she has another walker -um she likes emptying kitchen cupboards
taking out things like plastic pitchers and
jars and stuff
so shes more into big stuff
-um and at this point you would say she prefers toys over books
definitely definitely
does she play with any dolls at home
do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home
no we havent
do you think that she recognized any of the foods from the last time or from home
good question
i wanna give her real peas but we havent done that yet
-um so she wouldnt know that these are the things she likes
she loves peas
i dont think so i dont think she recognizes those
cause for instance we dont eat ice cream off cones
and spaghetti goes through the blender before she gets it
yeah no i dont think recognizes them
oh the bottle
she useta drink bottles
thats been a while
she started eating solid food at four months and stopped having a bottle like the same day
so she still breast feeds
but that bottle thing she much rather have cereal
-um lets see
at this point do you think she recognizes the names of any of these items or she
or are there any other items that maybe arent here that you think she would recognize the name of
i think she knows cereal
-um which means cheerios
the stuff that you mix up with formula and feed to her in a spoon i think thats food and not cereal
but cereal
and other than that its hard to say cause she loves mashed up peas
but when you tell her shes about to have peas does she really know thats going to be different than spaghetti
im not absolutely sure but she smiles when you say peas
so she might know peas
thats spaghetti
only it tastes like plastic
i think she knows dog
thats different than food but she has two puppies
i think she knows dog
she may have said her first word yesterday
well she
weve taken all of two weeks of sign language class
and the sign for all done is like this and she waved her hand and said
and i was like
that counts
she hasnt repeated it yet though it could have just been a fluke
i -uh as the proud mom of course i wanna say was all done
yeah thats what i wanted to say because well i just think youre fabulous
but if she does it again then ill
really say it
are you having fun
yeah you are huh
okay so some of these questions are -um the same as the ones before
we just wanna so get an idea if anything has changed as far as what he likes or seems interested in
-um okay so we which of these toys did he seem the most interested in
the plas hard plastic ones
food items
-um any of them in particular
-um i think he liked the cookie
theres two
find the cookies
where you going
-um if you hadta pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you say
and why
from here
-um i would probably say like the waffles or the anything hard and plastic
he likes to pick things up and throw them and bang them around
-um okay
which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
-um the baby dolls and that kind of thing
cords that arent toys
no play with toys
he didnt seem interested in any of the books
he didnt seem interested in the books or
or the baby doll
its okay
its okay
no cords
lets see what else we have
do you think he recognizes the names of any of these
probably not
i say some of them because
well he doesnt eat a lot of cookies
but he eats pizza and stuff
but he probably wouldnt recognize the names
-um is there any that
i guess he had seen them last time so he
i remember this one but i dont think he does
but he liked the texture last time
and he seems to still like it
and do you have any of them at home
any similar
n i mean we have a couple stuffed things at home
but he doesnt really play with them anymore
we dont really have anything else similar
i mean we have books but
what kind of books do you have
-um board books and then like books that we read to him that have textures
i i dont even think we looked in this bin
but yeah we have something like this
which we didnt even see
we didnt even see the book
do you play with pretend food at home
or dolls
nothing like that
i think that is all we have
oh its interesting now is it
yeah his thing right now
hes into things that arent toys
paper and cords and
anything that can go in small pieces in his mouth
lets put the toys away
put the toys away
which of the toys seem to be of interest to her than most
and the cookies
and the bee
and i guess the bear little bit
i mean i think it was similar in the sense that like i mean shes not doing a lot of interactive play like imaginative play yet
shes still kind of mostly just exploring everything
-um so it seems about the same i mean maybe a little bit more interested
-um like the functions of things like i mean she was able to engage to a limited amount you know a little bit more in the imaginative play but
lets see
-um the books she definitely she was not as interested in
i guess just some of the i mean some of the stuffed animals she didnt they werent as interesting to her they didnt like do things like tickle her or whatever
yeah what do you see hes saying hi to all the animals
lets see which books do you think she would prefer to read or look at like any types of books
-um she usually likes the ones that are interactive where she can feel things
okay do you play with any similar toys at home now
i mean we have a baby doll that weve since the last time we came weve taken it out and weve played with it
now -um but shes still mostly just like would give it kisses and like look at its eyes and stuff like that
-um books we have a lot of -um and i dont
i mean we have some stuffed animals but again like we dont play with them too much
okay do you think she prefers books or toys in general
-um i guess toys
and what does she like to do with them
do you ever pretend to feed them or anything
-um not really again we dont have pretend food yet
-um and like the doll doesnt usually come to the table with us when were eating
so no i mean we dont really pretend to feed the baby much but we
you know mostly shell give it kisses and like well talk or whatever
well for sure baby book
-um bee maybe
i mean theres enough toys that she has that like have bees on them like winnie the pooh bee stuff like that
-um so she may recognize that
-um puppy she should recognize
-um and like i said some of the words and the like maybe like the ball and there stuff like that
she knows the word ball but whether she understands it in a two -um thing i dont know
thats it all set
i just have a few questions for you
okay so since his last visit did you notice any difference as far as interest in the different toys
he seemed more interested this time in i dont know
i cant remember what he was
i dont remember what was here last time if there was food or not
we had the exact same toys
so im just wondering if anything comes to mind
like some of them come and they just like playing with one thing the entire time
and like the next visit they pick some other one thing
but it seems like hes
he he seemed pretty diverse
he liked the spoon for quite a while
-um i like i said i dont remember what he played with last time
today so he seemed most interested would you say in the food toys or in the stuffed animals or
-um i think the food held his attention the longest
so thats probably what he was most interested in
which toys did he seem the least interested in
-um i guess the books
he didnt really even touch them at all
do you think there are any items that he recognizes the names for now
there are a few things
but i i like you know different foods that he eats he seems to be excited about
but i dont know that he he really recognizes them
or if hes just hungry and wants food you know
-um its hard to tell sometimes
so what food items do you think hes familiar with
-um and hes had spaghetti
but you know it doesnt look anything like that
hes had some bread and hes seen me pull it apart
but i dont know
i dont know that anything really stands out
whats wrong
wanna try that
wanna try that
lets see what else we have
do you have any of these toys at home
-um his brother has a food set
not exactly the same but
what about the books
are there any books that you see here that
-um we have put me to the zoo but not as a board book
we have lots of doctor seuss but
and we have the foot book
and we have some books about the farm
farm animals and
from the animals do you think he recognizes any names
we have a couple books with a frog
but his older brother doesnt like stuffed animals
so we dont keep them very long
-uh yeah
he might have recognized the frog from a book
does he play with pretend food with his brother ever
play with it in terms of mouth it and take it around the room yes
okay i think thats all we have for you today
lets go see what your brothers up to
all right buddy
go right ahead
-um so what toys do you think seem to -uh captivate her interest the
seemed like the food one that it was last time too
the food
any sort of food in particular
or just like in general
i mean mostly she was playing with the pizza and the hamburger
you were playing
mostly those right
how did this visit compare -um to the last visit in terms of like
what she played with
-um i think she played with a few more this time
but not many
she did play with those last time
which is really funny
because we dont have any
food at home
so it seemed it grabbed her attention both times
she was much quieter this time i think
just really it seemed strange
she just seemed really quiet today
do you think she knows the names for any of these items
do you think any of them she recognizes
like you have any at home that shed recognize
the books
shes useta books
we actually have a couple of those
but just books in general
are you sharing
are you sharing with me
thank you so much
that was yummy
thank you
we have so those im not surprised
what stuffed animals did she seem to like
you sharing again
thank you
she wasnt really fascinated with any of them this time
she didnt really gravitate towards any of them to stay with for
any period
does she watch -um any cartoons at home with like animals in them
no not really
if the tvs on its of her brothers shows
so she does
we havent any like watched any of the like really baby ones
or einstein any of that kind of
so unfortunately youre not seeing those on tv are you
no youre not
in general what toy or story seemed to interest her the most
at home or here
-um anywhere like
youre into cars and vehicles
because your brothers play with them all the
youre just like your big brother
she is like her brothers
she chases them and follows them around
what else do you tend to like now
you like
what do you like
you like playing the music ones
you like banging things around
and so you usually
go over to the boys toys instead of the baby toys
yeah i know
and trying to walk
that fascinates her walking around
getting as far as she can
and exploring how far she can move over
sounds like a fun life
it is its a pretty good life
was she interested in the baby doll at all or
not so much today
a little bit more last time
but she does have a baby doll at home
and she will play with that on occasion
i dont know
maybe this one was just too big
well just because there were so many other fun things to try
what did you like today
what did you like
so many choices
you really like that pizza
she does like the pizza
you like all the colors on that
or is it just a really good size for your hand
and you like the microphone now
can you let got of that
did you hear it making noise
i heard it
from you grabbing it
i heard it
so you said you dont think she knows the name for any of these
or recognizes them
i really dont
i mean shes a good eater
so she eats a lot of food
but i dont think she recognizes if we say do you want cheese or
i dont think she knows that yet
i dont
i think you recognize your name
and when we say mommy and daddy
i dont think you got like
or food yet
how old are her brothers
three and five and a half
oh wow
they look out for you
they do
what -um
like i said the vehicles anything that moves
theyll run around in the house in a circle
and she will crawl around and chase them
even though she gets lapped over and over
she will continue to rotate around the same circle with them
dont you
you do
you do
and theyll sing to her
and then when we do any kind of little
-uh songs
they try to jump in with us and do them too
will they sing their abcs to you
or if we do ride a horsie into town
your brothers always have to get in on it with you
shes not useta this much time i think though
you know one-on-one time for thirty minutes
is thats impressive
isnt it
you getting upset
you want that microphone
where you gonna go
where you gonna go
should we get another one
what do you see
do you see winnie the pooh
wheres winnie
oh no
im a hold you
i promise
i know
you getting hungry
well if i mean thats pretty much all
that was all the questions
-um just when do you think you could come in for her third visit
because we try and schedule one like ten months and then another
one eleven months
we can talk with
you have a calendar handy or
now do you want her to be eleven months or around then
-um around then
you can go
shes very strange usually
shes like i really expected her to be over to those wires
and peeling everything
she seems obsessed with the plastic food
cause its nearly lunch time
yah shes a lot
-uh she was chewing on those peas
quite a bit
again im not sure the color or the feel
she obviously doesnt know theyre peas
and the pear
but -um yah i think i said this last session i needta get her some plastic food because she seems to like it
did she like those last sessions
and i havent got her any
you know so this is the second time shes seen it
then plastic toys
we got this structure
was she interested in any of the soft toys at all
-um not really
i mean like she knows when i do a frog at home and go
she was smiling
so she recognized that one
she smiled
-um and i do that at home and she smiles
how about the books i
yah she could we have a peekaboo book at home that she really quite likes
and she tries to turn the pages and lift the thing
but she seems more interested in the plastic foods then the book
no not really its not enough for her i would expect
and shes at the wire
but normally id have been chasing her around the room
we play in the basement and theres like one wire and she goes straight for the wire
but last time i dont think she was really crawling
she was you know this time she can crawl
almost walk
she still didnt move
has she started eating any of these types of foods yet
-um shes had like spaghetti bolognese
some baby form and peas
and that looks like zweiback bread which is a german twice baked bread
so i thought shed associate that cause it really looks like it
-um and the rest she really wouldnt recognize
pears yah she would know pears
aha bch
does she do that at home
usually like reaches
and the peekaboo books shell like try and you know usually bends the peekaboo book
and but she really was showing no interest in the first session
she enjoyed the spoons and the food
and -um do you go over animals noises with her a lot
yah i do that a lot
like i say like the frogs
when you do it she smiles like as if there was a recognition
she might have just have been smiling at the actualy sound of the noise
i dont know but there seemed to be some sort of recognition there
i dont really do any other animal noises i dont think
all the animals i didnt know what noise they made
i didnt know what that is
or that so
and she did the cock a doodle doo obviously
-uh no
i think she can
because we have a cat
shes more interested in my mic
shes like theres something new on your shirt i want that
i know
you cant have that
can i ask mom some questions
so the first question i have for you is whether youve noticed any changes in her preferences for toys since the last time
-um or whether you think shes playing with the toys differently then she was the last time she was here
-um i think the last time we were here she didnt really play she just kinda sat and i just kinda handed her things where now shes pulling things
and now that were done with that youre gonna talk
get down yes get down
-um now shes picking
like she wanted the frog she saw it she went after it
she really wants the door knob
so while were in here she really likes the door knobs at home
so thats where shes going
and so what does she do just
she just wants to get to the knobs any knob
shes very interested in knobs
dresser drawers she pulls them open and dumps all of the clothes out
and we have -um an armoire in the living room that has the knobs on
she holds on to the knobs and walks
she really likes door knobs
im not really sure what it is about the shiny things but
shes into it
she saw it first thats why i kept trying to turn around
she was gonna go for the door
its like i want that
see shes still looking at it
so shed rather have that than any of these toys
than any of it yeah
if i let her play with that knob the whole time we were here she would play with it
its like you cant have that between that and this microphone
alright well clearly there were some other things that interested her besides these but of these toys what do you think she was most interested in
-uh anything that makes noise
so she really liked the keys and the spoons because they make noise
she shook the bottle but it didnt make any noise
right it didnt make any noise
and she did play with the frog and the rooster
you gonna beat me up with winnie the pooh
so she liked -um these two things here yeah
the noise
i think they were the only things that made noise
she had the waffles and she banged them and then she put them down
and now she -um is looking at something else now that were talking but okay
its because i put her over here
i think when i sat her in the middle theres so many choices
she didnt know
shes familiar with the baby doll because we have one at home
so she went straight for that
thats what i was gonna ask you too actually
-um of these toys do you have for instance dishes play food or anything like that
no i actually dont have play food
i thought she was a little young for play food since she still puts everything in her mouth
we dont have play food but we have lots of things that
we have keys and things like that makes noise and little balls that go in the little things and she bangs them
can you say thank you
youre thinking about it
you cant eat the paper
and so she doesnt have these types of things but she has a baby doll
yeah she has a doll and she has keys and we have a few stuffed animals but not very many
and how interested is she in those at home
-um she carries the baby doll around but she leaves it
she likes to bang things
shes really into anything that makes noise so thats why she kept going back to the keys
shes very sociable
so she kept going back to those things that made noise
yeah thats pretty much
i tried to get her to play with the pizza the book
we have books and stuff at home
do you read them
at night usually at bedtime
she has her favorite book so i dont usually read during the day but when were going to bed
she gets a book so
if this was more like bedtime
she probably wouldve sat but she sat there but she didnt pull away
she opened this one and then she closed it back because i started reading it she closed it back up
shes like okay im done with that
and i read a couple of these pages of this one
but she wasnt paying any attention so i put it back
and which of these toys do you think are good for her personality
-um there all probably good for her
she just right now only likes the noise making ones
i dont even know why just very interesting
we were just discussing that at home
anything i have maracas they make noise
i have clappers
everything that makes noise a variety of things but she always goes for the noise makers
shes gonna be loud
just tells me shes gonna be loud
youre very quiet no talking
-um which do you think interested her the least
-um i do not know she was into some of them
but not very many
the books
well but i think more because shes accustomed to getting a book at night and its not
so youd say the stuffed animals probably
do you think there are any of these items that she would recognize the name for
-um outside of the baby doll probably not
and maybe book she she knows what a book is
so when i say on the bed
i put the book on the bed and she goes and pulls the book when its time to go to bed
we have the global babys book
and it just has pictures of babies in it
and she opens it and points to the babies
so i think she would recognize that book as a book but i dont know that she would recognize other things as a book
i see okay and how about the bottle
well she is nursed so she doesnt really gets a bottle
so she was interested in it but not because she recognized it
right we dont normally well she actually had a bottle the other day
so i dont think she was that interested
she doesnt recognize it because we dont use it enough
so you think she was looking for it to make noise
yeah she kept turning it over and i think she was interested in the bubbles
but it makes bubbles
so once she saw it make bubbles she was trying to get to the bubbles
and now shes trying to open the baby dolls eyes
the eyes dont close on our doll
shes gonna clean it up
shes into everything
back to the bottle
so there were some items you think she probably hasnt seen or heard of before
yeah probably most of the food
i mean we have real food at home but none of the
like shes seen pizza before
weve eaten the pizza but no it doesnt look like the pizza weve had
but the food i mean i dont know maybe i should get food for home but we we have stuffed animal and baby dolls and books but we dont have the food so
its just more to see whether these are novel items or if there completely new to her or whether they are something she plays with at home or a sibling at home
-um thats really
yeah if there were cars in here
-um okay and then i think theres one more thing
does she ever pretend to feed the baby doll
no i havent seen her put anything in any other things mouth
no im sure thats coming but probably because she doesnt really take a bottle
so and now she really wants to drink from a cup
a straw or a cup
she would prefer to have either of those
im getting teeth
yeah say the bottom ones and the top
almost in all the way
im like im getting teeth
is there anything else
i think ive asked all the questions i have
anything else you wanna add or things i should -um take note of
no i know they called and asked if she had -um an ear infection
but she didnt and before we came the last time we had just come from the wanted her to have her hearing tested
but she didnt see anything in there
do you have any concerns about her hearing
no its just where she had the ear infections and the pediatrician sent her
but the said there was nothing in her ears so im assuming if theres no fluid then
but she could probably hear a pin drop
and then that i mean she
her hearing is probably just fine
yeah she definitely if somebody is moving somewhere shes looking to see
whats that
alright thats all i have -um are you
i can take the microphone now
-uh shes probably done
next question so if i could just interview you really quick
then you guys
and he can just
you wanna keep playing hehe
you can
you can keep playing
you can just
you keep playing
well i dont know if you remember
what he liked the first time
but did you notice
or remember any changes from what he played with
-um i remember that last time he played with the stuff that was similar to what we had at our house
you want me to read it
in a minute little guy
and kind of the same
this time
the waffles like we have waffles at home
that are pretty much the same
-um and we have other food to but the ones that are the same as what we have are the pizza and the waffles
the other ones are just a little bit different
and he kinda picked
and those are the ones he picked out
the clock i dont
we dont have a clock
so i was surprised that he picked that up but
i do not know if it was the texture maybe
the foam
cause we have some foam things at home and he likes those too
and the baby i do not know
maybe cause of leah
-uh he likes the baby
and -uh we dont have a lot of
at home at all
i do not know
-um and we do read all the time
i was going to
hes -um very comfortable with the books and he tries to turn the pages all the time at home
he seems really familiar with
are there any of these you have at home or
we have a peekaboo book its not exactly the same but its really similar
where it says something
a question
and then you open it and theres a baby that says
so that ones really similar
the other ones are not
he doesnt have the zoo one
lets see
which toys do you think interested him most -er would you answer the same way the ones that are familiar
yeah it seems like the ones that are f
i think just the ones that are most familiar
besides the clock i do not know that one seemed a little more random
-um and it looked like
does he play with baby dolls at home
not really
he seems
doing some feeding are you guys were or something
yeah -uh
to eat
we dont really -um -um my daughter does that with her stuffed animals
so and maybe and hes just now getting into food
so it may just be from that
thats just pretend
do you play any sorta of -um
just pretend
little games hide and seek and that kind of stuff
we do peekaboo a lot
and -um
his sister does peekaboo with him all the time too
his sister
when shes not crying heehee
ha yeah
she likes to play with them
that ones not real
ill feed you in the car
ill feed you in the car
you answered that already answered that already
do you think he prefers books or toys
books or toys or does it depend on
it kinda depends on his mood ive -um
the only time i could get him to really sit for a book -uh -um
really calmly is when hes
tired or right before a nap or before bedtime the rest of the time he just wants
flip through
randomly or eat it
but sometimes hehe yeah
or putting it in his mouth
or eating it
and he didnt seem to -um i do not know if that was
it mightve been cause i was blocking i do not know -uh
stuffed animal talking
not really
we have a bunch
-uh shes obsessed with them but he doesnt really get into them no also she tells him no he cant so maybe thats why haha
hes a good listener
okay and you said he doesnt necessarily pretend to do any feeding at home with
no no
-um and about any changes you said its pretty much the same that
similar yeah
things that he has
yeah seemed that way
okay oh and i noticed does he know body parts or do you do body parts
he doesnt seem to
-um we do them a lot but i havent noticed him consistently
so he wasnt necessarily
knowing them or pointing to them no i dont think so
whats yummy
are you sharing
thats your new thing
you hold it out and go yeah
thats a ducky
its a ducky
and a sheep
-uh theres leah
can you see that shes looking
i hope i didnt forget to ask you anything
is there anything
that -um stands out to you about the way he interacts with toys or his preferences are anything like
not really
alright the next time we see you well just
next time well live leah with daddy heehee
i was surprised shes
i do not know she was
she was tired
she was tired she was sick last weekend and now she has a tooth so its just a lot of things
its hard for her
its you know hes been getting all the attention
yeah and hes getting attention from me which she doesnt love
come back and turn this way
hi honey do you wanna come to see the toys okay
he can keep playing
in terms of how hes playing and what hes playing with have there been any changes that youve noticed since the last time you were here
hes using objects more purposefully
you know like banging things together
and -um
hell get books and turn pages in board books and things like that
-um so -um
was he interested in it
yeah last time
he has one at home
and he seems to like the babies
hell hug his baby at home and give it kisses
thats interesting
much to his daddys dislike
daddys get that way
yes they do
i think its sweet
-um okay so hes playing more purposefully
he likes books a little bit more
so hell take them and turn pages and stuff
yeah the board books
-um and he listens better to them
you can read -um stories that hes familiar with
-um he really likes books with -um babies in them real pictures of babies in them
hell watch those and even -um
i think hes starting to anticipate
-um theres one book in particular he likes where it says and then you turn the page and boo
and he always seems to anticipate that
and hell smile when he knows that parts coming up
so hes
is he familiar with any of the books that are here
and do you think that -um he prefers books or toys
-um toys i think
which of the toys do you think are most interesting to him at this age now
from here
-um i think hes more interesting in this that he can hold in his hands and bang together
and then he seemed to like i think the texture here of of something like this
you gonna eat that
how about in terms of home
what does he like the most of toys
-um blocks and -um cups
he likes cups a lot
-um that but more if you build them up hell knock them down
and he likes to bang them together
hes not -um you know putting things in them or or pouring things out of them
he likes things that he can shake too
rattles he tends to go to those
things that make noise too
yes you do like that
-um which of the toys here do you think interested him the least
the animals
yeah the stuffed animals
does he have any of those at home
he has a few but not very many so
and how does he
he doesnt usually pay much attention
when theyre new when they first come out he will
and then they tend to be put away
or he leaves them in his basket
he doesnt pull them out
hell pull them out
he doesnt play with them i guess i should say
he likes to take things out
and he just sort of tosses it aside
you get the feeling it could be anything
lets see
so do you think his interest in type of toy has changed since the last time
-um yeah
i think
no he seems to be playing with the same toys just in a more purposeful way
-um you said he has a baby at home and plays with it
he turns pages of the board book
and does he have kitchen and food items like that at home like we have here
aha he doesnt have those
i dont know so much that its board books that hes able to manipulate
its more the bath books
those are the ones that i see him kinda turning -um more so -um now that i think about it
okay theyre the ones you mean
the plasticy ones
the the ones that can go right in
because he these are i think harder for him
hell if hes sitting on your lap hell try to turn it
but its usually many pages at once that get turned
you want that
when he plays with the baby what does he like to do
hell hold it up
and -um a lot of times hell -uh put the feet or the hands in his mouth
hell babble to it
-um sometimes if you tell him give the baby a hug hell you know bring it to him
-um he puts his mouth on the head
which we say hes kissing it but i dont know that that he is
cant get up
thats interesting because a lot of the kids at this age dont like the baby
oh really
so thats interesting yeah
-um okay so he doesnt sound like he is feeding the baby or
no he doesnt do things like that
-um and then i think the last thing is at this point do you think he recognizes the names of any of the items here or beginning to recognize any names
the the objects that are here
-um no
probably not
maybe the baby a little bit because
-um more so at home though i think if you say that he does know which is his baby
the toys that he has at home
the babys probably the only one that he really -um sort of knows and not not consistently i wouldnt say
i think thats about it
is there anything that i didnt ask you that you think would be helpful to know about how he plays or what he plays with at this stage
no this is pre
hes happy playing -um by himself
he is
hes pretty good about that
and i hes quiet a lot of times when hes playing
-um whereas if hes in the car he seems to make more noises and more babbling
but he seems quiet when he gets new toys and things like that very focused on them and
and he can entertain himself it seems like
thats great
okay well thats all i hadta ask you
that the cookie
were all done
can i take this off
you can leave it there until were done
oh okay
you keep playing
-um so i just wanted to ask you
theres been a little time since you were here last because i think hes around ten months now
yeah hes ten months aha
i dont know if you remember what it was like when you were here before
but do you notice any changes in his interest in this stuff
like is he more interested in s things this time than he was last time or
i mean hes still putting everything in his mouth
i mean because thats still where he is
hes using some things appropriately
like now hes eating food more regularly
so he recognized the spoon
and he put the right side of the spoon in his mouth
and he did that with the bottle and the sippy cup
and i think last time he was kind of just chewing on everything
and now hes chewing on the bottom of the bottle but
but theres some recognition
and he went from books
-um he does spend a lot of time with books
-um at home
but again they often wind up in his mouth too
but he can flip through the pages and stuff
oh really
the only time we really do dolls is to keep him interested on the changing table
so and he doesnt have a baby doll at home
do you think he was interested in
well he was definitely interested in the face
-um he always seems interested in like eyes
when he saw the clock he touched the eyes
and when he saw the baby he touched the eyes
and he does that with a couple of his books too
i dont know what it is about eyes
-um i think he was a little interested in the face at first
because he was touching all the different parts
and the mouth
but then again then he just wanted to lick it
i heard you doing something about feeding the baby
was he interested in that
i dont know if he realized what i was doing
i mean i was just trying to model
he doesnt really do any pretend play yet
but -um
and when i gave something to the baby then he wanted it in his mouth so
right okay
so he doesnt wanna miss out on anything
-um lets see
so at this point in his development what do you think
oh hes
now hes giving
you giving the baby the
thats so nice youre sharing
at this point in development what do you think is best sorts of toys for his personality and his stage of development
excuse you
-um i mean hes really for the most part interested in a lot of gross motor things
so now he wants to
i mean what he chooses at home are kind of the big things
things that he can pull up on
things he can climb over
plays with balls and blocks a lot
-um and he has a bunch of toys that you know if you do something to them they make a noise or something
he likes those
and hes got a fish bowl that he puts the fish in and out of that he likes
-um bangs stuff together
i mean its still a lot of making noise
oh yeah i saw that
i saw him doing that a little bit
like when you put him to bed we -um put a couple like chewy toys in his bed with him
and he bangs them on his crib for a little while before he falls asleep
and thats just playing
i mean hes not angry
thats just how hes entertaining himself
he likes to put them through and watch them fall to the floor
hes only been crawling for a few weeks
so i think hes realizing that he can get new perspectives on things
so i think hes kind of just exploring that
-um pulling himself up on everything
pulling himself up on stairs
its opening up a lot of possibilities for him
i mean he loves to sit in the kitchen and play with the tupperware and things like that
okay so speaking of the kitchen -um i dont know if you have these kinds of toys at home
we dont
was he interested in the dishes the food just the whole thing
or what do you think
he seemed to go for the food more
-um well the pizza and the cookies kept him for the most part
and why do you think is there some quality of the toy itself
or do you think he recognizes
hes never had pizza
he doesnt eat these foods yet
-um i think this has a little give
so it was nice to chew on
-um i think the fact that there were a couple of them was kind of interesting to him
but no he doesnt eat any pizza or cookies yet
do you think -um colors attract him at all
i noticed the pizzas are kind of colorful
yeah that could be
and im just wondering if youve noticed that at home either
i mean everything at home is colorful
all of his toys are colorful but
oh he just pooped
dont put your fingers in it
yeah thats exciting
lets see
so you did look at the book a little bit
you said he wasnt so interested in that
he wasnt that interested in it
but he does books at home
he does do books
and we do books as part of his nighttime routine
and then he also has books -um just like in his toy chest
and we put all the touchy feely books in his toy chest
so hell go through them and touch the things
and eventually just chew on the book
and you said he likes to turn pages
he does turn pages aha
yeah honey were not gonna chew on that because that could get ruined
here chew on the pizza
so would you say he prefers books or toys
he prefers toys i think
i think you said he has some things like this on the changing table but
yeah but its really just for us to keep him occupied while hes changing
okay and no baby dolls at home
okay so this one was new
this was new yeah
and hell do the same thing when he sees a baby too
hell wanna touch the face
and even when he sees kids socially
hell always wants to go for their face
i think really tiny infants are really attracted to the face
but when he sees kids he wants to touch their face
and so he doesnt have dolls
so he doesnt pretend to feed dolls at home
oh and do you have pretend food
or no
okay so he doesnt do that
so you said he doesnt really eat these kinds of food
what do you
but he eats peas
oh he eats peas okay
but i mean hes still doing a lot of
i think he pooped
it stinks
-um his food is mostly pureed now too though
the only things he kind of eats in chunks are like strawberries and pears
so he wouldnt really recognize icecream or bread or anything
he wouldnt recognize that
his food is all still pretty little
lets see
-um like you said he used the spoon appropriately
are there any words names here that you think he might recognize
like spoon or bread or some of the things that you were saying
mm of the stuff here
-um is probably the
and then -um the sippy cup
-um because i dont know that i ever talked to him about spoons
-um no he only has bowls
he doesnt have plates
mhm okay
-um i think that might be all the questions that i have
okay mommys gonna
which would you say would interest him the least
these things here
i think so
i think thats it
anything that i should know -um about his toy preferences -um other than what youve told me
i dont think so
well get another chance to do this f at your next visit
-um which
i mean should i get some of these things
would that
no thats okay
th we were sort of interested in how
because this stuff i stuff i think is still a little old for him
hell come back at two years also
and develops
we should probably get him a baby doll
so that he learns about body parts and stuff like that
he seems to like it
i mean hes got stuffed animals at home
but nothing thats humanlike
so thats probably a good idea
alright well we can be all done
im gonna change him before we go
i have a few questions for you
so -um do you remember what she liked last time and has it changed
i think she focused on the food a lot last time and shes focusing on the food this time too
anything in particular
food items
she likes this meat
and i dont why because its not very colorful
maybe it looks really like its real shes kind of eating some real table food so it might be more appealing than some of the stuff that doesnt look as real
maybe it hasta do with the texture
little bumpy
and shes teething it could be soothing her
but shes not sucking on it really for her gums so im not sure why she likes that
she liked the doll at first and she does seem to like babydolls when we see them in the store and what not
shes just very nurturing already
she likes to feed things
thats about all she
she could be just hungry but she just seems like thats her focus is to feed it whatever it is
she was feeding the dogs
but she wasnt as interested in the stuffed toys
i think last time she did play with them a little bit
she was really not interested this time
especially not unless they were the two little dogs
if it was pooh she didnt wanna even look at pooh
-um she likes the spoons
i dont know what her fascination is with spoons shes that way at home too
and she didnt really give me much attention on the books
normally she likes books
so i cant say shes necessarily going for the things with lots of color
she seems a little interested in this bottle
and shes not nearly as talkative as she normally would be but maybe thats because theres so many things in front of her
whats that bch
what did you find bch
spaghetti bch
yum you had spaghetti last night for dinner bch
i was gonna ask you do you think she recognizes any of the food items or anything
-um maybe the icecream
this might have been interesting because of the colors im not sure
it looks interesting
and shes not really eating icecream so im not sure if shes relating the two
she could be looking at that spaghetti and thinking it looks similar
she ate the noodles last night
she likes keys
she didnt play with it as long as i thought she would
but she did at least look at it and kind of hold it and twist it around a little bit
and she really i think her favorite thing was these peas
so i do not know if its the texture the color she eats a lot of peas so
she could think theyre real
are her peas that she eats are they like mushed up or are they
she did eat mushed peas but now shes eating regular peas
she likes peas and carrots thats her favorite food
so she could have thought those were real
yeah definitely
thats about
but she seemed annoyed when i kept trying to show her the stuffed animals
i want food
i wanna eat
look kennipoo bch
you gonna feed them peanut butt bch
oh you like this one bch
okay bch
yeah you like his shiny hat bch
you gonna feed him some dinner bch
im hungry kennedy bch
can you please give me some cookie bch
please bch
kennedy bch
excuse me bch
can i please have a cookie bch
i notice she kisses most of the stuff too
whatever it is she kinda kisses it
or bites it
kennedy bch
your friend is awake bch
kennedy bch
you like her eyes bch
eyes bch
mouth bch
mouth bch
eyes bch
yeah bch
eyes bch
eyes bch
good job sweetie
eyes thats right bch
eye bch
eye bch
thats right bch
eyes yeah bch
you like her eyes bch
her hair bch
can you say hair bch
hair bch
dont hurt the baby bch
say hair bch
dont hurt the baby bch
kennedy bch
why are you pulling her hair out bch
you dont like the baby bch
hair bch
hair bch
yeah hair bch
eyes yeah you like eyes bch
do you have babies at home
she loves like babydolls
shes kinda young to like them but she does
dont hurt the baby bch
why are you hurting the baby bch
shes your size baby bch
so do you read a lot to her
and do you have any of these books at home
or similar
i have similar things not these
this one looks kinda familiar actually
i dont have any of these
i have one like that with the touching with the different textures
and we do read a lot of doctor seuss theyre just not small like this
but i have baby books for her
that size
-um what else was i going to ask
do you have lots of toys at home that make a lot of noise or whats her thing
does she like toys that make noise or
like is it more babies or is it more reading
she likes noisy toys
the stuff that she can bang on like shes got the little piano thing where you stand up and walk around it and it has different sections on there where it makes different sounds
and then shes got a we got it for christmas a microphone toy
so she likes to turn the microphone all the way high
and then yell in it
and stick it in her mouth and yell
so thats probably her favorite thing to do with her toys
-um and she likes babydolls
she likes the ones that move
you know with batteries or something but
those are probab
stuff that lights up
probably is the most interesting to her
and she likes to watch movies like intently
she doesnt even take her gaze off the movie its weird
because we have movies in the car and she just the whole time shes watching the movie doesnt like to be interrupted
you can take her to a movie theater earlier than most kids
probably i could
i havent really tried that
my husband took her and said she was fine
but in the car she watches movies all day all the time
in the car
-um do you play games with her like -uh pattycake or anything like that
what other types of games do you play with her
-um peekaboo pattycake ill hide stuff behind my back or under something and see if she can find it
-um she likes to crawl down the hall and i come and chase her and grab her and say come back kennipoo and shell laugh hard super hard
she thinks thats the funniest thing in the world
so i guess the chase well ill chase her down the hall
-um she likes to think shes gonna get away with something
god bless you bch
god bless you baby bch
so shell take something and -um that she knows she shouldnt have like a pen or something
and shell look at me and then shell try to run with it
because she knows she shouldnt have it
and she laughs really hard when im trying to get it from her so she thinks thats so funny
oh thats funny
shes testing you already
is that your favorite bch
i think it is bch
yeah bch
like why are they not coming apart
i think that they do look the most real maybe out of all the foods
do you have any food items at home
mhm we have a full kitchen in our play room
she doesnt really play with that food though maybe shes not interested yet
or its in her house so shes not
but she -um
and actually she doesnt really like the play room that much which is strange because its all primary colors and theres a big soft mat to walk around on and do stuff
but ive brought her down there a few times and she just
maybe shes overwhelmed i mean theres a lot of toys i have a lot of children
oh yeah
shell probably like it when shes older
she was in a play
for christmas
she was
she was baby jesus in a big huge production
oh thats great
and she did really well
she didnt cry or anything
little actress
yeah bch
kennedy bch
you like the peas honey bch
shes like im hungry
i think shes trying to say that
alright i think thats it
do you have anything else to tell me
she seems just like shes right where she should be
shes doing fine
and shes got older siblings
a three year old a five year old and a seven year old
so shes probably gonna be a little advanced in terms of trying to learn to talk sooner
i think my three year old ive never seen any child talk as as well as she did and as quickly as she did
she was saying full sentences at eleven months
shes not there
she still babbles
so who knows whatll happen with that
i think its great when when babies have like older siblings to look up to
and just try to be like them
and shes -um really close to walking
i mean shell stand for long periods of time
she wont really take steps yet
she likes to bounce i dont know what thats all about
yeah shes she can stand with balance and hold stuff
shes shes really right there but she just wont do the steps
shell just start bouncing really hard and im like
and she wont fall
so its like she knows how to do it shes got the balance she just needs to
yeah she might
i think so
i think she will
shes ready
she just needs to do it
which is gonna be a whole nother other level of where are you kennedy
yeah put up baby gates
oh my goodness
shes all over the place
ive never used gates with any of my kids
okay do you mind if i ask you a few questions
-um did you notice any differences as far as what he preferred to play with more this time than last time
ah no he stuck the plastic food in his mouth last time too
-um yeah same general stuff because we have more plastic food at home
he doesnt really care about stuffed animals
and he still loves playing with wires
okay haha
he was beelining for the wires last time too
yeah aha
do you think he recognized any of the names of the food
-um i dont know
he doesnt eat any of this food
i mean hes had mushed up peas before
but i dont know if hed specifically recognize the name of pizza or cookie or peas
ah just because its not food that he eats
what about baby dolls
do you have baby dolls at home
yeah his sister has a baby doll that he chews on her face sometimes
do you with him and
how does he usually play with the baby doll
-um like i said theyre his sisters
so well theres two of them
and they both belong to his sister
she actually does the interactive you know im a mommy
im taking care of my baby play
hell go over and kind of study the features
like why is this little person not moving
and then like i said he just likes to try and chew on her face
because its another toy
and he tastes tests everything
anything can get in his mouth he puts there
do you think he recognizes like hand shoe eye
those types of things
some stuff yeah
like i think eyes nose
i dont know if he knows shoe
-um he might
-um but i dont know how many of the body parts he really recognizes
for me to say
this is the ear
this is the hand
this is the eye
are you reading books at home
yup ah we read picture books together
and you know like the little board books
and then -um im still nursing him
so i generally have one of my older childrens books
like alice in wonderland
or -um i forget which one of the narnia ones is the one we just finished
i think were on harry potter now
ah that i just read as you know as im nursing him
so not that hes comprehending that
but hes at least hearing it
but then yeah we do picture books and stuff
what do you think he likes to play with more at home books or toys
ah toys
hes much more into toys
hey good boy
-um do you have any similar of the s su of same books at home
ah we have good night moon
ah we have mister brown can moo
-um for some reason mister brown can moo is not a favorite at our house
but good night moon generally is
but weve got a lot of the other classic ones
you know hell chew on the covers
but -um i have a two and a half year old whos way more interested in books and reading and stuff than he seems to be at the same ages
but we all still read together
-um what about the -um books like the touchy feely books
ah hes got a truck book that has different textures in it
and he likes going through
and hell use the tip of his finger
and hell you know touch each of the ah textured sections on the pages
he does like the truck book
do you think he likes at this stage more touching or like noises or
ah touching and -um things that he can hold easily in his hand
he likes banging toys together
-um we have a lot of little people
and so he likes playing with those
because they fit well in his hands
and theyve got detail
and hell look at them and then chew on them and look at them again
and -um how about the farm animals
or the farm animals
the stuffed animals
hes never really cared much for stuffed animals
i think the reason that he played with this one is because it has -um the funny hair
-um the sticky hair which gave it a different texture
but he doesnt really care about stuff animals
so yeah hes definitely into toys more than books or stuffed animals
okay do you think there were any names like even of like domestic pets or animals maybe that youve seen books on
the names of them that he would be more familiar with
probably more familiar with like you know the regular domestic animals
you know like i dont think he knows otter and fox and eagle and fawn and goose
-um but you know i guess hes starting to comprehend the
-um we have a little farm set at home
so cow and horse and
he chews on the lamb a lot
so im like
thats the sheep
thats the sheep
but i dont if i said
you know pick out the sheep
if he would be able to
go and select that one
but we generally do more teaching and explaining and talking about the toys than we do with books
just because thats where his interest is
is more with the toys
so if you were to say what he was least interested in today
stuffed animals
and is that different from the last visit
no he didnt care about the stuffed animals last time either
and he had only medium interest in the books
but liked chewing on the fake food
we have a kitchen set and a lot of fake food
so this is most similar to the stuff that he plays with at home
-um thank you
does that rattle
and like i said he was trying to get the wires last time too
but wires arent one of your categories
yeah haha
yeah no you still cant play with them im sorry
-um do you think he played similarly here today like he would at home with you
-um yeah the toys arent necessarily in concentrated piles
so we spend more time kind of going around going from one thing to another
i also have a two and half year old
so a lot of the play that we do is focused around what she says she wants to play w
you know well be playing with blocks
and hell come
and hell help by knocking over towers and sticking things in his mouth
or were playing in the kitchen
and he sits over by us and puts things in his mouth
common theme with him
ah but yeah i mean obviously its a little more awkward to just be in a concentrated environment than when were at home
but because theres a lot more sibling interaction craziness going on
-um at home
but yeah i mean just interacting and talking about stuff
and i try and let him just explore a lot on his own
and just you know its fun to watch them sit and play with something and try and figure it out
and you can just see the gears turning and
see if you can help them out at some points with it
and other times they dont really need you
you know theyre just having fun
thats right
do you think something with the toys hasta do with
i asked you some type of variation on this but
-um the ah colors or more the sounds
my inexpert opinion
-um they bang together neat
they make a sound when they bang together
-um theres probably different flavors in the plastics
different textures in the plastics and woods and stuff
more opportunity for noise
whereas stuffed animals i guess they all kind of taste the same
-um hes teething
so i think its also
it feels good when he chews on hard plastic
like it feels good on his gums to be able to gnaw on things
im ready to just ask you a few questions
-uh she can just play with what she wants
hi there
okay so first of all do you notice any difference between what she liked this time and last time
i dont think i remember
i vaguely remember her chewing on this but
otherwise no she mostly likes these
so you would say she -um liked those the best today
and do you think theres any particular reason why she likes those
she can chew on them
and they make more noise when shes banging them together
so those were her favorites
how about
what did you see
oh she didnt touch any of the stuffed animals
although that was the first thing she was going towards before we started
theres no further interest in
and how about the baby doll is she interested in that at all
shes interested in the mic though
no baby
i think she liked the eyes opening and closing
and she likes pulling on her eyes so she liked the dolls ears too
how about the book
is there any interest
i mean they caught her eye for a second but
was she
you may not play with the microphone
did she recognize the names of any of those
either the food items or the -um implements
maybe spoon
but otherwise most of this is stuff she cant eat yet
oh okay
at least not in that format
she can have peas but thats about it
no ice cream yet
no ice cream
no cookies for you
no cookies
you just need to be a little older
-um okay so you think probably last time that she liked those same things
do you notice any difference
in the way shes playing with things
-um between last time and now or let us say in the last two months
what is it
do you have spoons
no we dont have a set of those
oh where you going squirmy
oh does she have any toy at home that shes attached to that we dont have here
no not really she useta have a favorite little toy but she doesnt seem to care too much about it anymore
now its just whatevers around
whatevers there
she likes chewing on paper
she also has a brother to play with
okay lets see
does she have any baby dolls at home
no not really
she might see them at church but
is she go to childcare the church
that might be her only time though
no not yet
where you going scrolly
but she kinda liked it didnt she
yeah well she liked the the soft and she could sink her teeth into it
mhm so thats how you like to play
so youd say she probably likes books if theyre good to chew
mm kay
well -um unless you think theres something that we should know about what she likes or how she likes to play then -um i think thats all the questions i have
she mostly just likes running around a chewing on stuff
cause shes a pretty active kid
so would you say that has something to do with what she plays with
yeah i useta imagine that my kids would like to sit down and read books but
not quite yet
my sons getting there
but mostly they just wanna chew on them
and other things
youre silly
youre so active and curious
yeah yes yeah
alright well then i can turn these things off and take the microphone away
while hes playing let us
youre doing a good job
hes happy
he is
what did you just say he was doing
hes putting the
hes putting all the toys behind him
does he like to do that
there normally arent this many toys at once
so he likes to drop them on the other side of gates and behind furniture and things
oh boy
lets not play with the power cords
ill be the blocker
i forgot i was connected to the cord
surprised he hasnt found that yet
so did you notice any differences between what he wanted to do today compared to last time he was here
if i remember last time
thats the question
last time he was very interested in these waffles
he was chewing on it a lot
guess hes been more interested in moving the toys around this time
from one place to another
throwing them around
did he -um play with any particular item the most
youve got something there
he played a lot with the plastic toys but i dont know if thats because he liked them best or because theyre in the middle and thats where he was put down
thats where he was put down
but he does typically like things that are harder that he can gnaw on
yeah it looks like he can pick up some of them too
he maybe eats some of the stuff whether he would recognize that its the same thing i dont know
what does he eat
that we have here
theres bread but i mean it would be in pieces he wouldnt have a whole piece of bread
not the wire
little pieces of pizza but again it would be in baby size bits
i guess everything would be
little pieces of cheese
hes got a cookie
yeah i mean hes had like just like little teeny tiny pieces of cookie
but hes never been like given a whole cookie
never a whole cookie
poor deprived child
probably yeah
-um did you start with a book
or did he like any of the books
yeah i mean i think he picked up this one briefly and we started to read it
got a couple pages and then he got distracted by something else
we have some books similar to this at home with the touchy-feely
farm animal type
and how about -um any of these animals
does he have anything like this at home
any stuffed animal type things
he does have some stuffed animals
-um hes got a winnie the pooh
hes got a few others
but usually not very interested in them
at least for very long
and then did you show him any of these we have here
i showed him some
we played with the puppet
and he thought that was
i mean you know it was a talking puppet
he thought that was fun
he kinda gave the puppet the cookie or the puppet took it anyway and he thought that was funny
and we read a couple pages of the peek a boo book because he really likes peek a boo
which i guess is normal
yeah thats pretty normal a lot of kids like those things
but yeah we have one similar at home and hes ripped the one of the things off
right hes ripped the flaps
like that sorry
theyre very strong i think thats happened before
-um and how about the baby
how about the baby did he see that
i dont know if he saw
he didnt make it over that far
is he in any kind of contact with younger infants
no i mean he doesnt have regular contact with other babies i mean occasional but not daily or anything
some kids are really interested
which is probably good because hed gouge their eyes out and then bite their forehead
right some kids are really interested in babies
right because they
checking it out
he sure is
especially those eyes huh
does he have any thing like this at home some
he has some sippy cups
he picked this up and held it for a while but he didnt pretend to drink from it
and not the bottle either
no hes never had a bottle so
oh here it is yeah
-um i saw him putting toys behind did he do anything else with toys
he threw them
doing that with them
yeah are you giving me kisses
very expressive
eat the babys face
-um lets see and
-um lets see and oh i dont know if this is a question you can answer
is the way hes playing typical for the way hed play at home
-um well he hasnt attacked any baby dolls but then he doesnt normally play with those
-um for the most part yeah
there arent as many toys at once and hes usually more interested in exploring the room because hes familiar with those toys and
you know hell play with a toy and then hell walk over and like i was saying his big thing is dropping it on the other side of the baby gate or behind the furniture
sometimes he seems to want us to get them back and sometimes its just a fun game to put them all somewhere else
move the stuff around
-um but yeah he wants to explore everything with his mouth
hes exploring the room now
remote controls are some of this favorites
-um and then we probably asked you last time but -uh i asked you about stuffed animals but does he have any of the plastic toys like that at home
i guess he doesnt have fake food
but he has
-um he has plastic teethers and i let him play with a plastic spatula or a plastic measuring cup of things like that
in the kitchen
we have some spoons here did he play with those
he didnt really he just kind of picked it up and pushed them aside
okay so he saw it
very interesting
well i wonder if he recognizes that as a human like
i think he probably does because he
you know a lot of babies will give baby kisses where theyre just kind of attacking your face
like hell bite my and his dads noses and stuff and kinda do like the open mouth thing to show affection
at least we think thats what hes doing
thats what hes doing to the baby yeah
of course the baby cant defend itself
from more aggressive
from more aggressive affection
i know you said he has books at home like the lift the flap -um do you think he prefers toys or books
at this stage
-um i dont know i guess it depends
i think he prefers things that arent toys or books just objects that grownups are playing with
i see
but -um i dont know sometimes he likes us to read
i mean a couple months ago you couldnt really get through an book because hed just try to grab it and eat it and he still tries to eat books but he also will sit and let you read him a whole book
yeah so it depends on his mood i guess
right and time of day
yeah first thing in the morning we often read books
okay i didnt run the play session last time so can you tell me which toys she was most interested in last time as well
by far this one
the bumblebee
something about the hair
a literally she had it in her mouth the whole time
and were there any toys that she didnt seem to pay any attention to this time
i dont think the doll was here last time
-um but yeah li yeah last time she didnt
i figured shes pick up on this one the black and white
she didnt pay any attention to that
she didnt this time either
oh i shouldve done the puppet
she likes puppets
what about today
which toys did she seem the most interested today
-um definitely the peas
-um and i think the doll
shes never really seen a doll
you know a doll baby like this
-um i think that definitely caught her attention
you trying to feed the peas to her
i dont think she knew what to make of it
and which would you say she was the least interested in which toys
probably the stuffed animals
most of the stuffed animals yeah
do you think she recognizes the names for any of these items
mm maybe book but yeah that would be probably it
what about any of the food items
most of her food is still -uh pureed
so i mean she might recognize the word peas
but i dont know if she would actually associate with that shape
you know what i mean the shape of the food
-um other than that probably probably not maybe ice cream
i dont know
do you have any of these exact same toys at home
-um we had this book
oh and good night moon
but -uh this is one two three a counting book i dont think this its the same book
its not the same book yeah
and would you say she prefers like at home books over toys or toys over books
yeah she she really likes her books which is something relatively new
-um but she also has -um like a tambourine and some maracas that she really likes so
id say those two are stiff competition between the two
it would be hard-pressed for me to say which one she favors more
okay -um now the animals do you think she
some kids have very early on teach them about animals and seem to recognize some of these animals
she doesnt watch tv
-um i doubt she recognizes any of these
she has some stuffed animals but she doesnt really play with them
-um the next visit will probably be in a month
-um well give you a call
you remember that
thats a completely new material for you
i just dont think shes
oh right you know okay maybe we shouldnt do that
now that you have teeth thats probably not a good idea
probably not stellar
okay so in a month
oh no problem
yeah that would be a good idea
oh no
not at all
looks like we had some fun here
she likes the food
which is no surprise because she likes food in general
she likes to eat
she loves to eat
what kind of things was she into
shh she loves the food
like it really got her
she really liked that
because like stuffed animals she really didnt care too
i mean she liked the bees hair just because its interesting
you know the baby she liked the eyes and stuff but
can i have my pen please bch
she wasnt nearly as interested in any of it as she was the food
come here amelia bch
amelia bch
come here bch
come get this bch
were there any particular food items you thought she was like really into
yeah she really liked the pizza
like yelling into this
she likes making her voice sound different
she she and her brother do that a lot
she liked the icecream
the wheres the spaghetti
she liked the spaghetti before too i remember that
and i think this bright red the contrast i do not know if she likes that this one
icecream there she goes
she likes the icecream
did she like this one
yeah she liked the waffle she was clapping the waffles together
i thought it was interesting too shed get two of the same and tr clap those together
oh yeah
which i thought was interesting the pizza and yeah
and so
you were reading a couple books to her
she likes books yeah
i mean she she loves -um karen katz she has a few of these
she really likes that one
course like rip the flaps up all the time
but that its you know but
and she likes any of these with the animals that she can feel
we have a bunch of these at home too so shes useta those
does she know any animal sounds
she doesnt make any yet
nope not yet
and she has this one at home too she likes that one too
so she likes that
but she dont cant recall her making any animal sounds yet
no she doesnt yet
because she just i mean just like a few months ago she just started talking like just saying the mama dada
oh okay
shell parrot us
but i dont think she makes any sen
like if we say what does a cow say she doesnt know what to say yet at all
if like her brother says a noise shell parrot it but she doesnt know what shes doing
oh she she she gave it kisses but that was about it
she wasnt as interested
last time she really liked the baby
she wasnt as interested this time
which is interesting
there she goes
she wants to kiss it and chew on it
i think shes teething on it actually
yeah so she likes baby real babies but shes not as she wasnt as interested
i think because we dont have any of the food at home
oh okay
and we have tons of babies at home
and i think that this just really is stimulating her because she doesnt see it and she likes it she really does so
right in the mouth
everything yeah
right in the mouth
all day long
whats this amelia
shes got the keys
yeah she she likes
and this we feed her little peas so
how can i eat that
she wasnt today
i mean just the bee with the hair
even when i mean we have this winnie the pooh at home
so i thought
but she she didnt care
she didnt care about the puppet at all
which doesnt surprise me
we have a puppet and she her brother loves like when we play with it and she doesnt care
shes just like eh
but yeah
hey you bch
she likes that game
she loves clapping and dancing
shes a little dancer
do you ever do peekaboo with her
she does peekaboo
its more like when -um ill hold her like shirt when were changing her we play like then
oh yeah
so she does peekaboo
and shell do pattycake if you play with her
her coordination yet shes still having like trouble figuring out but shell play
she does this
does it taste good bch
she likes to clap a lot
and she just started clapping the two two toys together this past week
shes a good eater
she is
and were lucky
because her brothers very fussy
so its like shes so easy and like its gonna be the situation where as they grow up shell be like hey you gonna finish that
and hell be like you can have it
you know
there are days where he just doesnt care to eat at all
i heard you mentioned a -um a dog
do you have a dog at home
we dont
but theyre around dogs all the time
because we live in a community where theyre constantly walking dogs everywhere so we see dogs every day
so they like dogs
their grandparents and all their aunts and uncles have dogs
so theyre around dogs a lot its just we dont have one
our neighbor has a dog chico
-uh whos a little chihuahua
so they see chico all the time hes always in the back yard
yeah but the chihuahua wherever he went
oh here he is
looks just like without the pink collar
looks like chico
she says this isnt fair bch
bottle bch
is that your bottle bch
pretty close yeah
shes trying
second babies i think
because her she just hears her brother talk all day long and i mean shell hell say stuff and shell just be like trying to say it too
so i think that really makes a difference
yeah its good that she has someone to kinda chat with
she likes the icecream
she does
alright well i think that we are done
thats good
alright that should be good
oh shes found one thing that she w
thats okay
okay so i just have a few questions to ask you
-um which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most
-um i think after she felt the hair on that
that became her ah new favorite
i think the texture she likes of it
which is a good toy for her personality
-um she tends to like her baby dolls at home
she likes to give hugs and kisses and all that to her baby doll but
a little bit smaller than this but
that ones like the size of her
so i think shes kind of not really sure
more than just kind of hitting them
she likes to make noises and stuff
but active
so she likes to do things
-um so which of the toys seemed to interest her the least
-um stuffed animals dont
i mean she just kind of likes to hug them
and throw them aside
i think the last time i was saying she uses them more at night
so i think she doesnt really see them as play time
-um which book did she prefer to play with
-um she loves these kind
i mean although i guess i kind of picked it out for her
but looking at different ones she seemed to like this one the most
she likes to do that with the flaps
haha it looks like it yeah
good job
is there any reason why
is it because of the flaps or
i guess i mean we have similar ones at home
so i guess just from shes useta them
and doing something with them
turning the pages she likes to do a lot
but especially with the flaps kind of adds something to it
and the bottle
you really wanted to feed yourself
are you hungry
were working on sippycups
so i dont know if that kind of she thinks is a different kind of
oh okay
were there any items you think your childs never seen before
i guess maybe the
but we dont have any at our house
are there any kinds of food that that shes played with before
i think she just likes things that she can hold
like the smaller ones that she can put in her hands
that kind of bang together
okay -um
where are you going
so for all the toys do you have any favorite things at home
i mean i know you said that
-um the book
we do have keys
the last time we were here she would not put these keys down
-um we do have keys similar to this
but shes not as attached lately as she was when she was younger
-um haha what do you want
you want that now
where are you going
do you think your child prefers books or toys
-um i think different times of days
i mean we read her a lot of books at night
so at night she prefers books
i think shes just useta routine
but during the day
shes at daycare during the day
four days a week i think mainly toys and stuff
i think it varies
whats she in the mood for
and baby dolls
thats for everyone yeah
starting to do the whole baby doll thing lately
where are you going
do you ever pretend to feed the dolls at home
-um yeah we do at times with like her bottles
and at times shell try to stick the bottle towards their mouth
dont eat the books
she likes to eat everything right now
and what does she like to do with the dolls other than try to feed them
mainly just hug them
we have a little cradle that shell put the baby in
kind of rock it
rock the bassinet with the baby in it
and we have a little stroller that like pushes a baby doll
and shell put the baby doll in the stroller
so i think she kind of acts it out
what we do to her
-um for the on the farm book has she seen any of the animals in the book before
and if so which ones
-um not seen in person
but just through books
the different animals
oh shes seen dogs
i dont know if theres a dog in there
haha getting a little rough with the baby
which of the toys seemed to interest her the most
she definitely likes things like this
she can put in her mouth that make noise
she really likes those
so do you think those are good toys for her personality
yeah definitely
things that make noise
things that make noise
things that move
things that she can definitely explore with her mouth and her hands
have there been any changes since the last visit in terms of toys or games
-um she loves these books like the peekaboo books
anything that she can lift up and see
like she loves those
as you can tell like most stuff goes into her mouth so
she likes these books more than like just the regular ones
you know she still likes them
and she likes to turn the pages
but these guys are like a new favorite
so like before naptime we usually read some kind of book like this
so she really likes those
and like the stuffed animals you know and dolls theres not a whole lot of interest in
she takes them leaves them you know
not as interested in those
so which of the toys seemed to interest her the least
probably the stuffed animal ones
she was interested in the the doll though
like thats thats new
i mean we dont really have many dolls at home
we have more of like the animal ones
so this you know she was interested in
i dont know if she thought it was a little person or
or not
we have no idea
lets see
do you remember what she played with at the last visit
she loved this thing
she liked the bee
and she played with a lot of like the food these things
because i think at that point she was really kind of teething
and she might be getting ready for some more teeth
so she played with the harder things a lot
and she played with some of the books
but again like this was the only kind of thing that interested her of all those
this yeah this stuff
interesting stuff on top
which books did she prefer to read or look at with you beside the ones that
i think the ones that have like either like the like the kinda like the touch and feel or the peekaboo ones versus the plain ones
i mean she still is interested but not as interested in them
does she play with similar toys at home
i mean the these type of books
she has lots of kind of blocks at home that she loves playing with
i think these are kind of like the the blocks
-um but yeah we dont have any any dolls though
thats the one thing we dont have at home that she seemed interested in
oh there you go lilly
you got it
you got it
so does she prefer books or toys in general
-um it depends
i mean like if she can see the books then shell wanna go after them
like if theyre out
but if shes just around her toys then shes kind of happy
and if theres like both of them together
i dont know
i think like when she gets a little more kind of like tired like around naptime because of her routine then she kind of moves more toward books
because she knows you know
but if shes awake like this and pretty active then she probably wants to play with toys yeah
do you think she
well she didnt really play with the food that much
do you think she recognizes any of them
she might recognize the peas
because she eats a lot of like
i think she was trying to like pull them apart
because she can you know now now she can pick up like whole peas and actually eat them now
versus like the pureed stuff
but no
like the bread and the waffle she probably just thinks like a block
you know
are you trying to eat that
do you think there are any items that arent here that she could recognize the names of
or any items that are here
-um li if like the you know the the little rings the stacking rings
i think she might
you know we call them her rings or donuts
and i bet she would go after those
thats probably something she would recognize
are those yummy
okay thats it
thats it lilly
were all done
can i ask you some questions now
-um can you tell me something about the play session today about what you guys played with
-um mostly the food
and he likes spoons and stuff that i give him in the kitchen
so hes playing with like the measuring spoons and stuff like that
hes really into throwing things
no bch
were not going after camera bch
i know bch
huh bch
0 laughing
huh bch
yah bch
thats the best remedies we dont ever have to say no
yah he just kinda throws things around right now
bangs things together
sometimes hell sit and listen to me read for a little bit
no bch
youre a quicky bch
you are so quick bch
come on over here bch
lets look at the toys bch
yah look at these toys bch
arent they amazing bch
no bch
look at the toys bch
huh bch
so you were saying he usually plays in the kitchen
in your kitchen
yes if im like cooking ill usually give him some plastic spoons
like serving spoons
theres a like a -um cabinet that he can go into that has like the tupperware and stuff like that
he just gets out and throws around
he likes to bang
right bch
do you ever put like sound effects
well sometimes ill give him like a metal bowl

or ill put things like in a water bottle and give him like an empty water bottle so he can shake that
yes that the baby bch

now were done with the baby bch
does he have any dolls at home
no he has stuffed animals but he doesnt have any dolls
is he exposed to other infants or
-um at -um
daycare he has but
theyre not younger than him
hes the youngest
he probably knows the word right
i mean hes heard it before cause my friend
we were just recently around my friend who had a baby
we were talking about baby
that the baby bch
yah bch
well tell me about the food
did he play with it today
he definitely played with the food
i think he liked -um the wooden toys just because they were heavier
and then when he could bang things against it
then everything goes in his mouth
i mean he likes peas
i dont know if he recognized the peas or not
yah thats the baby bch
you give the baby a kiss bch
you gonna give kisses bch
that hurt bch
yah give kisses bch
thats funny
yah so he likes things he can kinda just toss around
you think hed recognize any of the names of the -uh
or theyre familiar
i dont know
i dont know if we
have you ever had waffles bch
youve had pancakes bch
but i dont know if youve ever had waffles bch
yah i dont know if hed really recognize any of the names
well tell me about the food items he did tend to go for
-um he was playing with the peas
and -um
the waffle on his own
and the pizza
i introduced the burger
which he started playing with
i think the spaghetti too
i might have introduced that but he was playing with that
and he got some of the plates
oop bch
and thats pretty much what
he just throws things
thats what he does at home
you get the spoon bch
can you feed the baby bch
when it comes to the food do you think he was attracted to the color or the texture or the names you were giving them
i think probably the color and maybe the texture
hes like a big
now that hes solid foods hes like a beggar
so when he sees anyone eating food he wants real food
you know
so i dont know if cause it looks like real food it was more interesting to him
hes like i won
where you going bch
you just walking now bch
oo you gonna sneak over there bch
come here bch
come here bch
yah hurry bch
oh our pants our long bch
yah oo and we just got these shoes and its hard to walk in shoes bch
-um how about the books
-um sometimes like when were playing hell want me
bring me a book and ill read it and hell sit and listen
he didnt seem too interested
this one he had seen in the waiting room and he likes all the touching feeling books
did he like any particular animals any feel for any animal or
-um he really likes
he always like the ducks
i think he likes the pig feeling one too
oh thats a different sound huh bch
do you -um have any of these books at home
-um no i dont have of these
we have things like that but we dont have that one
and we have board books but theyre not those
-um do you ever play like patty cake or peekaboo
hell play pattycake
hell do peekaboo
trip you wanna play pattycake bch
or thats very exciting
you play patty cake bch
yah bch
pattycake bch
so funny
what are you doing bch
yah bch
thats all very exciting
can i pull your pants leg up
yah oh theres another spoon look it has monkeys
there you go
oh right were talking about the books
was there anything different about how you played with the books or
-um the items in the books that were interesting
not really
i mean usually ill see if were sitting down and playing ill see he wants me to read him a book or hell bring one
and then i read it as long as he looks like hes interested and then when he stops then i stop
and how about the stuff animals
-um at home he plays with stuffed animals a little you know
a little bit
but all of his are bigger
so i dont know if its like the size is different so then he wasnt just interested in them
or we dont have any of the plastic foods
that might have been more exciting
where as we have -um stuffed animals
we dont have any puppets
and he really liked the puppet
and theres not really anything that
like this dog doesnt look like our pet dog
but he he liked this one
i dont know if its the pink -uh necklace thing
are there -um familiar animals in here as far as their names or
-um the goose might be familiar because when we go on our walks we always see canadian geese
so i talk about those while when hes in the stroller and were walking around
but he didnt seem to really recognize it
any of the farm animals
hes been around horses
and -um thats about it
of the animals
what were his the if you hadta pick the animals that he liked to play with the most today
which ones were those
well he liked the kangaroo puppet
did he touch any other
trip come here bch
what are you doing bch
yah i dont know if he played with any others really
were there ones that you tried to get him interested or thought he would be interested in
like the dog i thought he didnt really care about that
i set up the groundhog for him
he did touch it but he didnt really do anything with it
he threw the fox
that was set up
i gave to him
come here your pants bch
yah but other than that he didnt really play with any of the other stuffed animals
oh did you guys play with the magnets
was that new
yah these were new
or i dont remember them last time
-um but he i mean he touched the head
and i was trying to show him that they come together but he didnt really seem to notice that too much
-uh what do you think was his favorite thing here today
probably the spoons and banging things on the peanut butter jar
he liked that
he liked the plates
he was playing with the spaghetti and the peas
he probably played with the peas the most
what do you think was his least favorite thing
-um hm
least favorite
i guess probably this little stuffed dog
he didnt really seem to care about one of those
trying to get him to play
or he wasnt really interested in the peekaboo book at all
is that fun bch
was there anything here today that you thought he would really enjoy playing with and he didnt
-um thats a good question
not really
well i did think he would like this book more
just cause we do have something like this where you have to lift things and hell do that
he didnt seem interested in this one
so yah i guess that would be what i thought he would enjoy more
and was there any toy in here that -um that you knew he was gonna be drawn to and he was drawn to
that kind of fits his personality
the plastic spoons
cause he plays with those so much at home
and thats because of the noise
yah he just likes to bang it on everything
does he put things in his mouth
-um not as much as he useta
he still does
but not as much as he useta
yah we like to put everything in our mouth huh bch
oop bch
what kind of foods is he eating at home
-um he eats pretty much anything we eat
the only thing he cant have is bananas
but other than that
you know i just cut it up small and he eats anything really
oop is that your bottle bch
has he already gotten like the treats like the normals like kids treats
that your bch
oop bch
-um yah so hes pretty much had anything
so that may have been why he was enjoying some of the food
some of the you know kids food
not the kids food but you know
real food
he has had my husband will always get ice cream and hell have some of his
yah can i get the sippy cup bch
i dont think it works bch
hes really trying
i dont think theres anything in there buddy bch
oop bch
you okay bch
alright well i think thats it for today
i think we talked about everything that you played with
was there anything that we didnt talk about
i dont think so
youre just happy to be here bch
oop oh you okay bch
youre okay bch
just a couple things that she played with i could ask you
it looked like she did a lot of playing with the kitchen stuff like the food and stuff
shes still real oral
she still puts everything in her mouth
and pretty much p like plastic toys is what she goes for
does she have anything like that at home or does your other daughter
so this is a little bit familiar
definitely the plates the utensils and the pretend food
okay so does she have any of these actual food items like pizza
not specifically
no i think we have a spaghetti that looks just like that
but thats about it
no cookies
no cookies no waffles
no sandwich at home
no shes not really familiar with sandwich
we do have the peas
and how about a bottle
we do have some bottles
but they dont look anything like that
haha no
and she doesnt even take a bottle
haha but she sees them a lot
yeah she knows what theyre for huh
because we babysit another baby
and that baby takes bottles
so do you think that
knows cookies
would be playing with this if libby wasnt playing with that stuff
she likes this on her own sort of thing
i would think so aha
and is it because of her personality or just the stage shes at do you think
i sort of think its like her stage
i think she still really likes to put stuff in her mouth still
and thats the most
she also has three teeth currently coming in on the top
so i think
you think the fact that its hard
i think its both exploratory and it feels good
thank you
you have a bottle for me
thank you
-um books are actually still hard for her because -um she doesnt care to sit still for too long
like if im gonna read to her it hasta be before she goes to sleep
and shes kind of -um you know slowed down enough
-um and then like s even stuffed animals shes not so big with
my other daughter was real like nurturing even by this age
like she would hold it
and she does that very rarely
she didnt really even go for that stuff did she
did she like the winnie the pooh
i think she was kind of neutral
okay so those maybe least
and the books not really because shes so active
yeah and shes really famil
i tr try to kind of shove books down their throat a lot i think
so she doesnt really care
shes rather do what she wants to do
so would you say that she prefers toys over books then
yes definitely
and -um besides these things that you said you have at home do you have any of these actual same books at home or stuffed animals or baby dolls
we have like similar books to this with the -um sensory things in them
but none of these titles no
and -um it looked like you were doing some animal things is she interested in that animals and their sounds
-um yeah shes really -um responsive to music and singing
she -um will like kind of dance every time music starts
or if youre singing and shell try to sing
right you love singing
haha yeah
do you think she knows any of the animals or their sounds
-um hm no i dont think she knows to like match them
i know she recognizes them as something familiar
ah i dont know if she would identify yet no
and but you say animal sounds as well like when you
play a lot yeah
-um lets see do you think her interests have changed since the last time she was here a couple months ago
-um i think shes definitely more interactive
with playing
oh shes got a rip
i think shes definitely more interactive with me when she plays
last time she was here i know -um i felt funny because i felt like i havent been playing with her that much
but she was like so -um into like exploring on her own
and i remember when she was a couple months younger like she could just hang out and play for an hour on her own
just picking stuff up putting it down whatever
and now she definitely wa
i mean shell still do that clearly
but -um she likes to play with my husband and i a lot too
yeah it seemed like she was doing that she was really interested
you played some little games with her like put the cookie in and take it out
which hand has the cookie and
she seemed to like that
she definitely looks for -um interaction now
if her sister is not around shell play by herself
but the minute her sisters in she goes to where she is
you know and its a problem
haha but she always wants to be where she is
playing with her toys and bugging her
im just curious does she sort of try to interact with libby or does she just wanna have
she kind of just wants to have whatever she has yeah
and i think she
i dont know if she knows but
she probably notices theres different toys out
like libby is allowed to play with different toys than she is
shes not allowed to have the crayons
shes not allowed to have the small pieces
so a lot of times when those things are novel she goes for them
and when i was here last time she was not resistant
like if i took a toy away she wouldnt really care
now shell scream at me if i take something away that shes really into
interesting so shes changed a lot
lets see -um does she play with dolls at all
a very little bit and just starting
she got a baby doll for christmas
that -um she seems to know is hers
and shes carried that around a bit
and she has a stroller that she pushes
but her absolute favorite at home is this little rideon car that we have
and she puts herself in it all day long
and kind of yells waiting to be pushed
so thats new
you know she knows she needs somebody to push her
shes communicating that
youre just amazing
lets see so thats different from last time
was she eight months when we were here last time
or six
-um we try to get children between six and a half and seven and a half
for the first visit
seven months a little before a little after
she probably wasnt standing up then
well i know it was hard for her she was in a bumbo
and i know that was weird for her
because she was definitely crawling by then
peekaboo do you wanna play peekaboo
you can play with that peekaboo
does she like that game
yes shell play on her own like -um whip her head around
oh just knowing her personality what sort of toys do you think sort of are her
musical ones
yeah -um i think she understands cause and effect
we have this big cube toy that when you hit it sings a song
and she definitely knows to hit it to get the music
and then shell dance to it
so yeah those are definitely her faves
so interesting
is that peekaboo
well i think thats all i needta ask at this point
is it okay if i ask you some questions
so what do you think that -um hailey liked the most
-um probably the waffle or the icecream cone
why do you think that she liked those
-um just because she probably is
or the spoons
i do not know she just spent a lot of time playing with those toys
hailey bch
hailey bch
thats not really a toy bch
here honey bch
always happens right about the end
shes like mommys not paying attention to me im gonna grab something else
keys bch
are they stuff that she eats
the waffles and
-um no
she eats like little itty bitty finger food so none of it resembles things here
so shes not that familiar with them
i mean shes more familiar with spoons but
-um do you think that she knows any of the names of the some of the foods that you played with today
-um probably not
because she doesnt ever see it like this
maybe like that because she has pasta but -um
oops bch
aha bch
aha spaghettio bch

well get you cleaned up bch
i heard some gurgles bch
no wonder bch
no wonder hailey bch
aha bch
ew bch
party in there bch
alright kiddo bch
clean bch
what was something that she didnt like to play with
-um she really wasnt interested in any of the stuffed toys except for this
she was really interested in that but
-um she doesnt play with stuffed toys very much
even though we offer them at home
she doesnt really play with them
so its pretty much similar to here
do you think she knows or is familiar with the animal names
do you talk about animal names
we do now -um in books mainly
we i mean she probably doesnt know all of them like that we of through in her books but
she probably knows dog cat because we have them at home
but -um probably
i think she recognized it like she understands bee
she knows what a bee is
but other than that i dont think so
not yet
-um did she like playing with the doll
i was surprised she didnt seem interested in it at first but she kept on going back to it
albeit very roughly
she yeah she went back to it so i was surprised
i had never seen her with the doll so
we dont have any of those at home for her yet
so yeah i was surprised to see that she was interested
what kinds of things were was she doing with it
-um well very roughly patting its head
-um and playing with the babys arms but
-um mainly just patting
-um were you trying to get her to play with it in any particular way
-um i i guess i tried to bring her closer to the doll
and -um i talked about it
-um and i guess i just when she like engaged with it i sort of encouraged it but i didnt like try to push it on her after i saw that she wasnt really interested in the beginning so
-uh how about books
she up until now unless its a touch and feel book she pretty much just besides a few books that we have at home like i just read it to her as shes playing
she doesnt really listen to books yet
so but there are a few books that we have at home that shes shes mainly for the tactile
so shes into more like the feeling
yeah if it has that sort of thing then shes engaged but if its just like a flat book she doesnt seem interested
how about -um in general what do you think she likes most about her toys
do you think its like texture color noise
probably noise
we have a lot of toys with noise in them
-um and tactile
i think
probably those two
what do you think in here kind of fits into those categories for her
probably tactile because she was playing with the food toys mainly and she was like putting it into her mouth and manipulating it so
-um yeah probably the the play food
like none of it makes noise so
she would definitely have been engaged with something with noise
-um but yeah mainly the the play food
is she using spoons
-um we let her try to use a spoon at home
it doesnt really work yet
shes just beginning
for right now
-um and then is she eating more solid foods
are any of them in here
she has like pieces of bread and shell have pieces of pasta and pieces of cheese
but no we never just give her like the whole piece
you smiling bch
what you doing over there bch
and so shes not really into stuffed animals at home
shell play with them but like minimally
shell touch it pick it up look at it and then put it down
figure out what it is and then leave it alone
pretty much
if it doesnt make noise or like feel or react shes not as interested
shes not as engaged
hailey thats not a toy im sorry honey bch
aha bch
thats not a toy bch
here lets play with the waffle and spoon over here bch
come here bch
here bch
come here baby bch
oh i know i know its not as f bch
but i wanna play with that bch
i wanna play with that bch
aw shes nice
yeah pat the baby bch
pat the baby bch
oh your tummy bch
yeah i mean we dont have most of these toys at home besides the books but
she -uh clearly likes the spoons
she does play with wooden spoons
big wooden spoons
oh thats not a toy either bch
-um lots of like she has a lot of interactive toys
but -um then shell also just sit there and play with a spoon or shell
i guess she has a lot of
oh no bch
is she in that phase now where shes gagging herself
i think so
so i mean i guess we have a lot of different textures and shapes and -um
oh shes really more into the things that like shes really more into her walking toy now
oh okay
so shes a really active kid
so i mean as you can probably tell
-um so she moves around a lot
active things
where are you going bch
oh yes bch
thats not gonna be stable bch
okay bch
here bch
okay well i think thats all the questions i had
unless you have anything else you wanted to add
about her playing at home or here
youre gonna go back bch
shes very single minded
thats another thing that shes doing now
she gets something into her head and
she sticks with it
shes rocking her own chair
hailey bch
youre gonna do a face plant bch
i dont want that to happen to you bch
you will cry bch
and hurt yourself bch
i know im sorry im such a meanie bch
what is that bch
oh hailey bch
alright well stop so then she can
whats going on bch
oh my goodness bch
oh my goodness bch
youre welcome
-um i just have a few quick
questions for you
-uh which of the toys seem to interest him the most
and which is a good toy for his personality do you think
-um thats an interesting question
like why do you think certain things interest him
i think -um the baby was certainly interesting to him because of the face
and he loves to see babies faces in books
and in magazines
and in -um like real babies thats definitely interesting and its kind of like you know a real baby
-um and definitely a sippycup and the bottle -um
because hes a big eater and big drinker
so -um we have books
but we dont have any play food
i mean we have some stuffed animals
and which of the toys seem to interest him the least and why do you think so
i think he was not interested in the book not because he doesnt like books more but because there was better interest and more interesting things to play with
so -um i think there was more of a -uh like a time just a particular time allotted and a lack of interest
and -um do you think there are any items he recognizes the name of
and were there any items that you think hes never seen or heard before name of them
hes never heard the word fawn im sure
-um -uh deer maybe for that matter
but -um certainly sippycup
and bottle
and plate
and keys
and cookies
-um measuring spoons
icecream im not sure about icecream cones
-um spaghetti
-uh okay quite a few
-um and do well you already answered this one do you ever play with pretend food not really
-um do you ever play with pretend dolls at home
yeah theres a doll at home
that -um that hes played with -um well that weve seen
hes had interaction with
-um okay and -um was there a particular book if any of them that you think he particularly was interested in
like with the way that you are feeling
definitely he would definitely like this book
-um well we have a very similar peekaboo a baby turn cast book its not this one but and -um
so books with babies books with things to touch in
things to lift up he likes those kinds of things
-um i havent really done too much doctor seuss with him
-um thats all i have for you yup
-um did she give you a toy
and everything yeah okay great
okay i cant quite remember what she liked during the first visit
but -um what do you think she liked most during this one
-um she seemed to like the pretend food
haha she definitely seemed to enjoy that
and -um i think she likes this box of cornflakes
haha she has
not quite sure what she sees in that
i was going to ask you what do you think she likes about that
i dont know
what do you like about that
i dont know whats so appealing about that
yeah haha
i wonder she gets very excited when she sees the yellow box of cheerios
i wonder if that reminds her of the cheerio box
oh very interesting
thats funny
it could have the effect huh
yeah maybe
maybe it kinda
its yeah
its a yellow cereal box
maybe shes thinking about cheerios
she seemed to like the spaghetti too just holding it and feeling the texture
bumpy yeah
what else did she play with
she played with these a little bit
she kinda shook them
do you shake these
shaky shakys
do you like those
i think so
yeah they move and make noise
do you ever give her real keys to play with
-um i havent given her like my real keys
-um weve got a few different sets of plastic ones at home
but shes seen something like that before
how about this kind of stuff
do you have this at home
-um we do yeah
we have some
because you have older kids
we have a play kitchen
-um and its got some pretend food in it
mostly we have like more dishes and pots and pans and stuff
my girls like to cook invisible food
they just yeah
yeah haha
so does she ever play
but we do have some of these cookies and stuff
yeah she does play with some of these things at home
yeah and
so she might be looking for things that are a little familiar
she didnt seem to -um like this container too much
how does she do with books at home
does she like that sort of thing yet
-um shes not really that interested in being read to
she likes to kinda move around and ah explore the room more so than sitting and being read to
so that might not be her thing
does she have any ah
unfortunately i dont get a lot of one-on-one time with her
and it seems like whenever i do sit down to read her sisters kinda push her out of the way
-um so which makes me sad
so that might be why shes a little bit more like off on her own doing things
maybe its her personality too
yeah it could be a little bit
you know well keep offering these things when you come back for visits
and itll be interesting to see
-um does she have any -um baby dolls at home
-um haha she doesnt have any of her own
she has a teddy bear -um
yeah we have some baby dolls at home
we have about probably at least six or seven of them
we have quite a few
they float around
-um shes got her stuffed animals
shes got her little teddy bear that she loves
and ah
but you didnt see one of those today
no teddy
did she like any of those -um animals over there
-um she didnt seem to be that interested in any of them
she liked this one best i think
she liked that one best
does she do animals sounds
is that what she liked
hm we do some yeah
saw you doing with the puppy like woof
youre just a star
i think she wants to be on
she wants to haha
ellie where you going
so she liked that for a second
hi there
especially when you did that ribbit thing i think she liked
she liked that
does she recognize that do you think
s ah sometimes
a little bit yeah
maybe it was just a funny sound
is it gonna stay up
haha pink puppy
pink baby
yeah are you a little pink baby today
did she find this on her own
she did
she did
you have this kind of thing at home
yeah -um we have some
she doesnt drink from a cup a lot
but she does a little sometimes
like a regular cup or a sippy cup
-um both
sometimes ill hold up a regular cup for her to drink from
and -um sometimes she drinks from a sippy cup
but shes
that looks a little bit familiar huh
this ones just pretend
lets see if there an -um
shes certainly seen sippy cups around the house for sure
so would you say that these kinds of toys at least as far as what were offering here suit her personality the best
what shes interested in
i think so yeah
so shes kind of active and
maybe it reminds you of
she likes to hold different things
i mean thats the right size for her hand too
oh you found something else
oh what did you find
some pizza
yeah you havent tried any pizza yet
im not sure if i asked you this already
do you think there are any of these toys -um or objects that she knows the name of
i dont think so
that doesnt look that real
some of them do like that ones a little more real
or how about that
would she know the name of that
i dont think so
she hasnt really been exposed to icecream
theres plenty of time for that
haha yeah shes sort of still just starting on you know finger foods and stuff
so she doesnt really know a lot
lot of different kinds
of food names
how about cheerios
do you know that name
haha she looked right at the box
yeah you know cheerios dont you
haha whoa
you know that one
yeah you know some words
okay and which -um type of toy do you think was least interesting to her
ah she seemed to be least interested in the doll
in the doll yeah
yeah she didnt really even glance at that
took a passing glance into this box and looked at th the one book a little
for a second
you didnt really do anything with that dolly
i wonder what will happen next time
-um did i miss anything
i think thats good okay
im gonna go ahead and ask you some questions now
sounds like she was busy
shes a busy little girl
what did she like playing with this time
the stuffed animals and the food
do you think she had any favorites
-um the spoon i actually dont know where it gotta
there it is
she loves spoons for some reason
she likes to hold them
but really i mean anything she can get her hands on
does she have stuffed animals at home
mm we have them but she doesnt usually play with them so much
so today she did
like them
i know you cant eat that either
which -um of the animals did you show her
-uh we did we pretty much did all of them
the kangaroo
their friend the deer
the fox
the zebra
the otter i guess
it says seaweed so im assuming its an otter
the frog and i think the goose
she kinda went with the bee
and the chicken a little bit
oh and the donkey over here
she just kinda
touched it
it is kinda gross
now that i look really closely at
it picks up everything unfortunately
i mean its interesting hair but
not very clean hair
mm we tried to clean it many times
it just doesnt
-uh yeah
it just makes it gummier
oh wow
like wetness makes it
i wonder if like wiping it down with like rubbing alcohol or something
that might clean it and stop the gumminess
good idea well try that
weve tried many things
but we havent tried that thats a good idea
how about the food items did she like any of those
yeah the pizza slices and now shes got the spaghetti
weve got a tea set at home and some like fruits and vegetables fake food and she loves playing with them
mm okay
she tries to eat them too
so shes in the mood for spaghetti
or pizza
and thats cool cause were having spaghetti tonight
so it works out well if you can wait that long right
do you think she recognizes any of these items
i think the pizza she does
yeah she loves pizza
husband does too
aha and does she eat - peas
we just started with peas and she likes them so im not quite sure if she recognizes them or she just though thats kinda funky looking
shes sorta putting them on the plate
she is
is that where food goes
and forks i mean spoons
shes trying to use spoon to dish this
ha spoons too slow
and then did you guys look at any books
she did not no books today
yeah and i was surprised she didnt even glance at the doll
cause she loves dolls but not today
she does oh
mm loves dolls
so you must have those at home
we do
we have many dolls that are sposta be hers and that dont really get to be played with too much
because big sister takes them but she loves them
and how is she with books at home
any interest
oh yeah she likes books
she -uh likes to eat them
they taste good apparently
shell kinda listen if im reading a story to my other daughter shell kinda listen in
but wanna sit down and listen yet
but she likes to take my books im a big reader and she likes to take my books and open them and look at the pages
thank you
thank you
oh i didnt eat it fast enough aha
oh i am
i gonna get this one
giving it to the - otter
thank you
so today you would say she was not interested in the baby or the books -um
a little bit with the food
some what
yeah select items of the food
and do you remember
when she was here for the first visit how she played or what she was interested in and -um
whether it was different today
well she went for the food
and i think i kept throwing in the stuff
she liked this thing
i remember that
but -uh and the stuffed animals she was kinda like yeah their cool alright fine mom but
she kinda just at first she kinda went
what do i do and
she played with the dolly
-um that they had
okay so
where you going
a little different today
because its been a while since
you were here right
so shes changed a lot
almost four months
shes almost eleven months now
so august something
so -um
so it seems like she may have changed a lot
mm oh yeah yeah
back then she useta just let jackie take her she just kinda sat there now she fights back and
shes got toys she likes to play with
are there any toys that she plays with she really likes at home that we dont have here
she likes things that she can push like wheeled things that especially ones that are big enough that she can walk them
shes -um
shes -uh we went from taking a step to two steps to five steps in a matter of days
so shes really wanting to walk
and so things that we have a wagon at home that she likes to push
she loads it up with her dolls and any stuffed animals that are lying about
and then pushes it around the house so
well shes
at that stage
yeah so yeah
she was definitely up on her feet i saw that
oh yeah
its the second child syndrome
its keeping up with the
big sister
better warn your daughter
oh yeah
shes already figured it out
shes like mommy then can come after me now
yeah i know
well i dont have anything else to ask
unless you have anything to add to it -um well see you back very shortly
-um she
may or may not change in
her interests
thats one of the things thats interesting
just to see if she plays differently or
if shes interested in something else
so well see but
it will be the same set of things
-um and like i said
hopefully this time well make it through the
shell make it through the
i will give you back this
are you showing off over there bch
now im gonna ask you some questions
you did a good job bch
alright so what was the first thing that he went to
first toy do you remember
-um i showed him the bee
-um i dont know what he went to on his own
probably the keys
or no actually the book im sorry
yeah bch
so he went to the the bee that was like put together like that
-um does he have any stuffed animals at home
he was some but i keep a lot of them put up because theyre like little stuff attached to them like his brother has
so i dont have a lot of the stuffed animals out just a couple
so he doesnt really play with those that much right now
so why do you think he wanted to pick up that first
this one
probably because its different
he probably doesnt see much something like this that often
and anything sticking up attracts him
you know the little antennas or the wings
you kicked your shoe off and your sock bch
so so he went to that bee and then he looked at the keys
does he have have this at home
yeah he has them on a ring
like the baby keys
yeah bch
so that was familiar to him
because theyre not on a ring like that its theyre just by themselves
right but they theyre shaped similar to this
so its probably why he they look familiar
and he also has the teethers that look similar to that so maybe thats why he
yeah bch
so and you said he also looked in the book
does he have that one at home
we have one similar
the goodnight moon without the counting
so we we have -um it looks almost exactly like that from the front
so big bch
do you have a lot of books at home
is that something he
we read every night before we go to bed
him and his brother and i
we read
he didnt really play with many of the stuffed animals i hadta introduce them to him
-um i showed him the clock and he kinda waved that around but he didnt really go to any of the food items at all
-um we have them at home so i dont know if maybe thats why
because hes seen them before
because his brother has some of this stuff now
yeah bch
so i cant think of anything
he didnt look at anything over here at all
usually at this age they are all over this stuff like on their mouths and everything
yeah well i i showed him the icecreams and he put them in his mouth
but i hadta show him -um hes very concentrated when he plays he doesnt wander a lot
so its funny hell stick on the same thing for quite a while and we have a lot of toys in our play room
so hes very content with one or two things a lot of times
it looks like he likes that bee
its really cool isnt it bch
yeah bch
do you have anything like that at home
-um we do have some like -um like a pizza at home
and bread
-um and he does play with the spoon a lot -um at home
so these should be familiar to him and we also go to the library where they have a fantasy area where he can play with this kind of stuff
and we were actually there today -um like in a kitchen area
so hes hes familiar with these items
yeah bch
here you go bch
so do you think maybe he likes to play with that because he doesnt have
i think maybe because -um anything -um that sticks out he tends to draw his attention
that he can play with his fingers
hes very fascinated with touching things
so he likes to -um you know check things out a lot
like hell crawl across the room for a speck of leaf on the carpet
yes he is
dont put it in your mouth bch
yeah bch
so do you remember the last visit when you did this same type of thing
-um are there any changes
hes definitely a lot more -um interested in new things
i think before he was still a little younger
and i in the last couple months hes definitely blossomed a lot more
now that he can crawl hes out hell hell explore a lot more so i think -um he definitely tries more than he did before
you playing peekaboo bch
dont put it in your mouth bch
good job bch
so you would say that this time he looked at a lot more than he did
i think so yeah
because last time i i hadta really initiate it a lot more
and so i think this time he -um
even though id initiate some this time he was a lot more interested on his own and try to crawl up and play with things that he wouldnt have before
and what about the doll
that was not really
doesnt interest him
it didnt this time at all
i do not know its because we dont have them at home
yeah he has a brother you said
and he i mean he goes over to somebodys house to play thats a girl but i dont know if they even play with it there that much
youre so big bch
youre so into youre so big bch
so what do you think
you said you read to him every night
what do you think he prefers books or toys
he likes the books or
i i think its probably about the same but i think in general he seemed to like the toys a little more
-um and do you think at this point -um as opposed to different from last time that he recognizes the names of some of these items more
like some of the animals
he may
-um i havent really sat down with him lately and and had a lot of one-on-one time with him
-um so thats probably not as good as it could be
potty training his brother has been a new priority lately so
oh so theyre close in age
yeah his brothers three
and hes ten months so theyre just a little over two years apart
-um so do you think that theres anything else that you just noticed about this play session that you might wanna add that anything that was like maybe surprised you about what he liked to look at or what he wasnt interested in
no this is pretty much the same type of toys he would see generally
it every day it changes with him so i cant think of anything special or different or anything
oh lets see bch
ill start asking some questions
i was trying to get her to talk because she does normally talk a lot
wheres all your babbling bch
wheres all your babbling bch
alright so what do you think she liked the most
oh definitely these
definitely these huh bch
that and the food
she likes the food still
how do you think she liked those so much
i dont know because she can put them in her mouth
probably oh we have a lot of this stuff at home too
kitchenny stuff yeah just like last time she didnt gravitate towards the stuffed animals other than she was fascinated by the tag in this one at first
but other than that yeah didnt wanna play with these too much
i tried showing her a couple of them but
we didnt wanna play with animals too much did we bch
she liked all the plastic stuff she put a couple of them in her mouth
its not actual measuring spoons but she has a baby one that has like three spoons on it and its the one in my diaper bag and its definitely one of her favorite things i dont know if its the noise or
definitely one of her favorite toys that i dont go without
its so funny
and she she ate she ate a couple of the your icecream cones she did put in her mouth and the peas
because i know you guys like to wipe this stuff down and the bottle she fed herself the bottle
and the cup
and we fed the baby
thats her new word just like in the last week she started saying that baby
baby bch
i can hear it clearly
its so funny
i mean sometimes shell stand up in front of the mirror baby
thats cute
baby bch
youre the baby bch
because see we have a lot of baby dolls at home but my older ones not real into that stuff
shes more of a dress up and dance than the kitchenny stuff so she doesnt see the older one do it as much so it didnt seem to i thought i just assumed you know shed follow the older one you know thats why this stuff is all over my house all the time
so i dont know if she plays with that because thats what she kinda knows from our kitchen or what
im hoping shell be a like a mommy girl
my older ones not real into that
do you try to -um you know play with the baby in a way thats
yes baby bch
in a way thats very -um similar to how you would normally act with a baby to show her
yeah thats what i was trying to do with her yeah lets feed the baby and we put the babys sock and try to get the shoe on
so thats what i was trying to do was play with her you know like we would take care of the baby i dont know if i did a good job but
we tried
what do you have allison bch
do you have peas bch
so what was her favorite toy last time if you could remember
i think it was something in this stuff too i dont remember if these were actually here i remember the keys
was it all the same stuff
it was
i dont remember i think it was this stuff too
the noise makers and the food the plastic food last time she was really hooked on these
the waffles i remember that
i dont know if it was the texture you know
this time it was the peas she kept picking up the peas or
the icecreams but i also showed her the icecream and she loves to eat the icecream
i pointed that out to her
i pointed out the pizza to her but she didnt pay too much attention to that
do you think she recognizes some of the food
as the play food that you have at home
she might we have icecreams at home yeah i think as play the play food yeah not as the real food
yeah i dont think shes quite there yet that she eats real icecream too i dont think she got that
i tried
but yeah i dont think that was
what about these items do you think she recognized these
the bottle yeah definitely
i think cause she instantly put it in her mouth
so i think she was doing with it like she does her bottle
and the cup too because ive been working with her on her sippycup so she automatically went and put that in her mouth too so i think those she did you know think they were like hers
that tends to happen
so do you have a lot of toys at home that make a lot of noise that maybe
yeah probably
yeah she likes the ones that make noise that that have lights and singing
she loves anything with music
oh you the baby bch
you see the baby bch
aha bch
baby thats good bch
see thats the first time ive ever really seen her like label it like correctly i didnt know if she really knew she was the baby or she just likes to say baby you know i dont know
thats whats fascinating about them
no were not playing with that bch
yeah we went for that one time
yeah i guess they make so much nowadays with all the lights and the movement and
we do have a lot of those types of things and she loves that stuff shell stand up and dance
you wanna show her dancing baby bch
show her dancing baby bch
theres dancing baby bch
theres dancing baby bch
you dancing bch
show me dancing baby bch
let me see you dance again bch
dancing baby bch
do dancing baby bch
not on command she does it better when shes holding on to something because the standing thing were a little unsturdy on yeah
but we have those things that you put on the fridge you know and you hit them and they play the music and you know
oh yeah i know
so we have the animal ones those leapfrogs and then we have one of the one the older one has the letters so she loves those things shell hit those things constantly and stand there and
very cute
baby bch
did you have a lot of stuffed animals at home or
not a ton and you know what theyre kind of from the older one has a lot she not as many and -um theyre in kind of in this canvasy thing and my older daughter doesnt play with them much so they dont come out much
so they just kinda stay in there so theyre not all over the house
definitely not
maybe thats why
shes not really into them
theres a couple in her bed you know she has a couple special ones that are hers in her bed but
thats what she wants under her face
are you showing off bch
youre so happy bch
you showing how you can stand bch
say i wanna walk bch
so what about the books which one do you think
she liked the peekaboo one
and we got through a couple pages of the good night moon one last time i remember reading her the touchy one and she wasnt into feeling it i was making her feel the stuff but i dont think it did anything for her i didnt try it again this time though
but she liked the peekaboo book and thats when she was saying baby a lot
she was kinda making that connection too there you know of the baby because thats why when you guys asked about the peekaboo thing she plays it a little but like she loves it when we play it but shes not actually doing peekaboo herself
got you
so thats why i said a little
like she likes to play it in terms of like mommy and daddy or someone else does it and i laugh but she doesnt totally do it on her own yet
not quite
say not quite bch
so is there anything else you think we should know about her language or what she plays with or anything like that
hm trying to think
i dont think so
not that i can think of
yeah most of the stuff is like you know buttons she likes like a piano we have this musical piano thing
and she likes hitting things on that and its lights and music of course too yeah
so yeah i guess she does kinda like that kinda stuff
yeah youre the baby bch
aha bch
aha bch
youre gonna have to pull more of those babies out for her to play with
i guess so
now those are kind of all over because we have like the stroller and we have the shopping cart and we do have those kinda things so
then im wondering if like if she starts playing with them if the older one will then play with them more itll be interesting to see
because i have a niece thats in between these two and shes really into the babies and into changing them and all that baby stuff much more so than my older daughter so im wondering if this one will be like that you know
its so funny because thats what i hadta get her for her birthday she wanted clothes for her babydoll whereas my daughter was like nah i dont need anymore clothes for the baby you know
she wasnt interested i said okay she wanted dressup she wanted every princess dressup thing there is
thats what she wants shes into the princesses and
thats funny
so you see it made noise
you like that because it makes noise bch
you like noisy things i guess youre useta noise around the house huh bch
and you like to swim in the pool youre a swimmer bch
right you like to go in the pool bch
and yeah she says meme she says meme usually dada baba and baby
the new one thats about it
right bch
i think thats all of our words that we say bch
yeah we didnt have too many to fill in that we can say yet
thats okay
oh speaking of which can i by any chance get a blank copy of that word list
that i hadta fill out
yeah do you have one i can get my any chance
because i with my daughter i i i kept track like i asked for an extra one and then i wrote down when she said each word it was just neat i have it for her so id like to do it with her
of course i fill the thing out and forget to make a copy of it before i even
oh thats okay
you know so i was like oh ill have to remember to ask them for a blank one of that
and then its easier it makes it easy too because when i have to fill it out again i already know what ive been filling in each word she says so
i dont actually have to think about it you know i just kind of went through and filled in the bubbles as she says more words you know
because once they really start talking it gets crazy i remember
oh you took the key aw bch
that would be great id appreciate it if i could get a blank one of it
yeah well get that for you
well be really excited to see you again in a month
in a month we come back
when do you want her between ten and a half
-um ten and a half and eleven and a half
and eleven okay
mhm so maybe the end of september
okay yup thatll be good
can i call
i dont know her schedule yet and i can try and schedule when the older one can be in school too so
thatll be good
we wouldnt have to bring her next time
but she hasnt started preschool yet right bch
havent gotten rid of that big sissy yet bch
preschool always starts later she doesnt start till like the middle of september
oh wow
yeah like the thirteenth she goes back so
shes got a little while
yeah that was the only thing she wanted to play with last time
last time she just shook those the whole time
that was gonna be my next question is what she played with last time
what was she interested in
what was she interested in this time
well the first thing she went for is the books and shes really into books right now
she likes to open them and close them and pretend to read them
when were at home well put books on the floor and she loves to just open and close the pages
and -um then she went after all the play food after that
she seems interested in mostly the ones with different colors on them
so she liked the cookie
the cookies and the pizza and then some of these -um blocks with like the different
she was banging these together for a little bit
does she like to do that at home make noise
yes she likes to bang blocks and things together or shake things
we actually bought her at the dollar store some spoons that she plays with now
cause she liked to play with these so much
she has her own measuring spoons now
is that funny
thats her very excited face
going back to the books -um did she like any book in particular
she picked up this one a couple of times
and then these three right here are the ones she picked up
does she have anything like that at home
we have good night moon at home
-um and we also have a bunch of little doctor seuss books but not these ones
and we read them at home
when we have story time shell sit on my lap and well read them
and do you think she picked those because they seem familiar in any kind of way
well i have noticed at home if we lay out a bunch of books she likes to pick the same two or three over and over or so
it is possible that theyre familiar
especially this one
we dont have this but we have the regular good night moon where the pictures are similar
yeah shes definitely starting to recognize things
well mommy was touching it so now shes gotta come over here
so she does have some favorites or at least those shes more interested in
more interested in
if you lay it cause ill let her pick
so ill lay like four or five on the floor and let her pick which one were gonna read whichever one she picks up first
she does seem interested
so she likes books
she certainly likes the measuring spoons
and you said she liked -um the play foods that had a lot of colors in them
thats what it seemed like to me like if i gave her like this shed hold it for a second and then shes just done with it
but anything that had multiple colors on it seems to be more interesting to her right now
would she recognize any of these like a lot of babies have peas
well i mean her peas dont look like that
you know shes kinda eating baby food peas
-um you know she didnt try to put anything in her mouth so she doesnt recognize it as food yet
because i know when theyre a little older theyll put play food in their mouth
yeah none of this would be stuff that she would get to eat
-um or necessarily see in this form like her peas would be all ground up still
she doesnt eat bread or
she doesnt eat bread she doesnt eat pizza
she doesnt eat ice cream
-um okay how about the bottle or sippy cup was she interested in those
no but she doesnt have bottles either
yeah shes
you like that clock
its got a face
yeah it definitely has colors and an interesting face
but its got an interesting material
was she interested in any of the stuffed animals today
not really i showed her a few
but she didnt really seem into them
she looked at the baby for about a second
but that you know as she was making her way through
shes not really into the stuffed animals yet
when we have them at home she mostly just picks them up and throws them out of the way as shes going for something else
she smiled at it but she didnt stop what she was doing to go play with it
see the piggy
oh this one has a feel
you feel that
like what we have at home we have the feely books at home
oh so does she like those books at home
but shes not so much interested in the dishes
she likes the -um the teapot when you tip it over it like makes noise plays music
thats what she plays with
but shes not so much into the dishes yet
she does
she loves books she loves to turn pages
okay were good i just have to ask you a few questions and then were all done
good job
youre such a good baby
-uh okay so what toys did she seem to be most interested in
-ah the food
she didnt even touch anything else
haha and -um why do you think that is
do you have any food at home
we dont and i dont know if thats why because it looks different
she doesnt have a lot of stuffed animals either
so i dont know why she gravitated towards that
the food that she was most interested in
-uh and was there a particular food that she was most interested in
the pizza
she kept grabbing
and what was she least interested in
-um she did look over at that stuff but she didnt even care about the stuffed animals
-uh and does she have any stuffed animals at home she plays with
she has -um an
and -um she has a -um a bigger teddy bear
that she kinda looks at but shes not really interacted with
-um and she was looking at the books over there do you read books at home
we read books i think she was more looking at this
but -um i dont know what she was really looking at because she didnt grab for anything
-uh and did she look at the doll at all
not that i noticed
so it was all food -uh do you play any kind of games at home like
-um yeah we do races at home because shes a fast crawler now and -um we have a dog so she just learned how to throw
so now we play fetch before she would sit on my lap and we would play fetch and tug
-um we do peekaboo but she doesnt seem interested in that
shes bored with that
oh okay
sometimes she likes bubbles sometimes she doesnt
theres no really way to tell
it just depends on her mood that day
-um and she has this -um wire
a toy where you move the balls
okay oh yeah
and she likes that
we play with that
yeah are you still playing with food
-uh and has there been any changes since your last visit
like which toys she is playing with etcetera
no last time she gravitated towards the food as well
last time she grabbed one of the stuffed animals but kinda like grabbed it and then saw the food and moved on
-um and was she interested in the same kind of food did she pick up the pizza a lot
do you remember
i dont remember i think she was playing a lot with the spaghetti last time and the peas
she held the peas the longest
yeah you didnt even see them huh gotta focused on the pizza
i dont know maybe just cause we dont have a lot the one we have is bigger and so she doesnt manipulate it very well
i guess shes just not interested in them
yeah -um
do you have any of these foods like does she see you cooking with them or do you and your husband
-um she just started eating finger foods
and shes had little cut up spaghetti before
but everything elses shes had doesnt look like this it looks pureed
-um unless she has noticed eating sandwiches or pizza or whatever but
-um the only thing thats here that she has eaten -uh whole is spaghetti
but it doesnt look like this its cut up
yeah haha
-uh and and has she been trying to use any utensils lately when shes been eating her food
she tries to use the spoon -um but it doesnt really work
i mean she kinda gets the concept that its sposta go towards her mouth
but -um shell either hold the spoon backwards or hold it upside down and the food falls off
so sometimes if we let her have the spoon shell take it and then grab it with the other hand and just shove it in her mouth
but she hasnt actually used the spoon
youre so little
and when youre at home what books does she like to read
she likes -um well right now i dont know if i can say its her favorite because she speak for herself
but she likes -um
good night gorilla because when we read it she giggles
i think shes sort of anticipating like the next page -um and we always point out the mouse
like well read the words and then well point out the mouse
-um but she also really likes -um anything thats soft that she can hold herself
she likes that
and anything that has elmo on the page
because she recognizes him so if elmo is in the book she likes it
yeah you like elmo
and you said that she doesnt play with food at home
we dont have food toys we have a little -um stuffed pot
like its a silver pot -um and it has -um i dont know if its an apple or a beet but it its round and red that goes in it
but she doesnt play with the food itself she plays with the pot
-um but its not hard plastic like this its -um fabric material
and does she do anything else at home playing wise that we should know about
she likes to pull herself up now and thats kind of her own little game that she does with herself
-um shes trying to stand independently so shell actually spend a lot of time shell let go with one hand
and then shell sort of lean back and think about letting go and that kind of occupies her for a while
-um and we also have -um animal magnets on the fridge
so -um that only holds her attention for about five minutes
but shell play with them and take them off and put them off and thats it
what else do you do
hm what else
-uh i guess now that shes getting older she is just getting into things
when she was a little younger was she big on any other toys at home
-um she really liked her -um its not she had the playmate with like the arches and she was okay with that but we had one that was separate -um that was like an arch with three pulleys on it
and when you pulled them it made music
oh okay
and she loves that
she actually still plays with that
we keep thinking that well put it away and -uh shell see it across the room and just randomly play with it one day
-um but thats what she liked when she was younger she loved the pulling thing
we are all done then
all done
were all done
did you hear that bch
shes playing
-um so
what do you think was her favorite toy
-um i think the
the foods
was probably her favorite
the spaghetti and the spoons
she seemed to really like the spoons
though its amazing its
its not until the end that she
that shes interested in this doll too
so does she have one at home
she does not
no so thats why i think its interesting
-um what about food
does she have any of that
we do we have a lot of
yeah we have a lot of this plastic food
at home
so i and -um
i dont we dont
dont have spoons though
i dont think
not that she plays with anyway
i mean she eats with a spoon also
she probably recognizes it
yeah she really seemed to like the spoons
maybe we should get you some spoons bch
when we go home huh bch
what of the food do you think she liked the most
i think she really liked the peas
she kept picking those up and
putting them back down and putting them in her mouth
she liked that spaghetti
and those are both things she eats at home so
do you think she recognizes any of the food
and like connects it
-um yeah its possible
i mean especially the peas
because she eats peas a lot and she really likes them
she probably and thats pretty much what they look like
so i would think she probably recognizes those peas
does she eat any of the other foods
of these foods
no not really
well spaghetti
but thats about it
i dont think she eats any of the other stuff though
no not really
oh i guess maybe pear
oh and bread
okay you do eat bread bch
straight into the mouth bch
-um what about the animals
do you have any pets at home
we do have pets
we have cats
but -um
and we do have a few stuffed animals
-um but none that look like these
per say
which ones did she play with
-um lets see
well she liked that doll
you still like that doll bch
did you you didnt even really play with the animals bch
did you i guess huh bch
thats right
you even took the kangaroo and chucked it bch
so spoons and food and doll for you huh bch
yeah bch
-um do you think she played with any of the same toys last time she was here
-um you know its funny she did
but only for a brief moment
she played with this one a lot when she was here last time
this dog with the pink thing
but -um
she didnt she only picked it up for a second this time
but she did she did go right for it and pick it up and look at it
she put it right back down
but she did actually pick this one up
and she did play with this one a lot last time
did you guys play with the food last time too
no i dont think she played with it at all last time
i dont think she was interested
she was interested in the spoons though
she did play with the spoons a lot last time
didnt you bch
you got a thing for spoons huh bch
you wanna go home and get some spoons bch
you wanna go home and get some spoons and eat bch
maybe well go home and well have some spoons and well eat bch
and then well have spaghetti maybe bch
hm bch
mm spaghetti bch
did you look at any of the books
-um we did just for a moment
i think we looked at this one
and she was kind of interested in feeling it
but when i started reading it she wasnt really interested
theres probably too much else going on huh bch
oh now youre interested huh bch
in the mouth bch
thats the biggest form of flattery there is bch
you like that huh bch
oh now youre playing with it bch
its amazing about the power of persuasion hm bch
thats upside down just so you know bch
there you go bch
well kind of bch
there you go bch
back upside down bch
oh well bch
nice job going from one hand to the other though bch
hm bch
feel that bch
isnt that nice bch
so you said -um
what youre having for dinner she can eat that too
or does she have her own food
oh she usually eats what we eat
yeah we just cut it up really small
so she usually and she just she just had spaghetti last night
and she loved it
so she does eat spaghetti
she likes it a lot
so did you recognize that spaghetti bch
hm bch
because you ate i heard from your dad about fifty pounds of it bch
i mean she doesnt always eat what were eating but usually
depends on if she likes it
or if its spicy
or whatever
well great
well i think thats all the questions i have for you
you know what bch
were gonna go bch
we have to give our microphone back bch
aha yeah
-uh what do you think that she liked playing with the most today
-um probably the doll again
well she kept going to the doll but then she liked the food too
i think yeah yeah
-um its funny cause after we came the last time and i realized she was into it we did get a few dolls
and shes been very into dolls and -um we have a few books of like baby faces and stuff like that
and checking out her babies -um we have a few friends that have babies but
checking out their faces and their features and stuff so
thats really sweet
does she -um how does she play with the dolls at home
-um she eats them sometimes
sometimes shell pat them and sometimes we put them to bed
and -um sometimes shell feed them
a lot of times when shes playing with it her brothers also there so hell help take care of the doll or whatever so shell watch but
do you have -uh play food at home
we do have play food at home
is that what she uses to feed
-um yes yes she will -um she and her brother also play store
so -um he will
hell be like id like a or id like spaghetti
we do have spaghetti at home
and then hell give it to her and
so its cute
thats sweet
hes a good big brother
do you think there are any foods here that shes now -um that are familiar to her either by look or name
well the cookie maybe she doesnt really eat cookies but her brother does once in a while so she may see that or she might know it as a cracker cause she eats crackers
i do not know what else
peas she might know
sometimes shell make a face if we say peas
pizza you may know a little
do you know the pizza cause william has pizza at home
plays pizza
mm is she still drinking -uh milk juice or anything out of the bottle
she doesnt drink out of a bottle but she drinks water out of a sippy cup
oh okay
yeah yeah so
she never took to the bottle unfortunately so
so we went right to the sippy cup right yeah
thats good
-um do you read books at home
we do read books at home mhm
we read a lot with her brother
and then -um right before she goes to bed we read one book so
are any of them on animals or what you read today
we do have -uh a farm book thats sort of similar to this yes
and actually she has another book that we read that has -um like has a pink poodle sort of like this in it
and -um im trying to think what else do we read
we have baby faces that she likes too
it has the baby doing different things
like angry baby or happy baby or dirty baby
clean baby
oh and she knows measuring spoons cause we have a whole cupboard of all of our baking stuff i just let them play with them and then when i use it ill just clean it but
thats a clock let us not eat the clock
so shes into spoons
she likes to try to feed herself
even though she cant
and with the animals are you working on like animal sounds with her or william
well william knows his and we sing -um little william had a farm
and so cause she also well we have like the little -uh people farm
and so hell bring out the pieces
and he actually does the sounds for her so
she knows -um she will do once in a while a lion
he has a little lion that he loves and he growls or does the and shell do that sometimes too but
mhm aw
mm mhm
she doesnt really do that like shell sometimes try you know try to but
-um but no they do like playing farm
we have lots of farm stuff
what do you think was her least favorite -uh toy or unliked toy
i dont know
you seem to like everything huh
was there anything that you presented to her that she really didnt
trying to think
she played a little with the frog i guess
the chicken
the book
shell usually sit for more like if were reading shell sit ill be able to read the whole thing and shell sit and sort of look or whatever but
today she seemed to be more into the food and the probably
and the other things
well she certainly enjoyed chewing
yeah oh okay okay okay sorry no
just very calm
oh she looks like shes lunging to me hello
very cute
oh you said she is eating peas
i mean ground peas but yes
and she eats -um she eats pretty much any food ground up
and then -um she eats well do very soft -um either sweet potato
or avocado
because we only have the two bottom teeth so chewings kinda hard
but -um she eats crackers
and she eats puffs and cheerios
what else do you eat
you gnaw on bread sometimes
and muffins
she likes muffins
so a lot of bready products
cause theyre soft yeah
theyre soft right yeah
we tried green beans but they werent soft enough
so we have to wait yeah yeah
shes having fun
she does -um apples sometimes too
like well peel it just like little pieces and shell just keep chomping it until it
right oh a key fell out
should we put it back
we put it back
its a purple key
right in the mouth
i know
okay okay alright
-um do you have your next appointment scheduled already
what do you think -uh vincent liked the most here today
probably the baby dolls
and the books seemed to light up his face the most
and when i rolled the thing -um
his sister has a bunch of baby dolls where hes always trying to get at them
and shes like
no those are my toys
and then she you know moves them away so i think he was very excited to get his hands one finally
we roll a lot of balls back and forth
he loves to be able to turn a page and gets very excited about seeing a new
a new page once he makes this movement
-uh and you know its like a miracle look its a whole different picture
and then -um
i guess new toys we dont have food toys at home accessible to him yet
theyre downstairs
so were not downstairs in sort of basement as much as you know we have a finished basement
theyre also some kind of smaller so
theyre little chokeable pieces to them and stuff because theyre you know a six year old style of food pieces so
do you read books at home
we read books at home
he looks through books a lot hes -um
well have these type of board books -um that he will just initiate turning the pages you know by himself -um
whether im facilitating or not
and he likes to throw things
do you have any of the same books
no not the same exact books
okay -uh how about -uh the food do you think theres anything here that -uh that he recognizes the name of
i dont think so
i havent
well i havent told him any names of food i dont know who else is talking to him so
maybe he does but
yeah hes still on like formula
hes still on formula with some mush
you know and he just started with some crackers
so not knows it but i mean ive
told him the word crackers when i hand it to him
i dont know if he knows it or not
and then bottle
i dont think i do anything for the cereal
i say more to him a lot like if he wants some more something
ill say more
i think all other food items i havent named yet
he scoots
he scoots his sister scooted too which is funny because theyre not
theyre not -uh biologically related
i got the two scooters in the world
yes i did
you should give me a towel afterwards
-uh do you guys play with stuffed animals at home
-um i dont play with him with stuffed animals his sister plays with stuffed animals a lot with him and makes them talk and makes them
you know
bounce around
i havent see him
go for a stuffed animal and play with it intently on his own
like i do w you know with a ball and a book and this
things that can fall apart he really likes -um
weve got this sort of wooden magnetic ball
its got little wooden parts that attach together by magnets to form a sphere
it was his sisters and both of them roll it
both of them like rolling it
and taking it apart
only his sister would take it apart with her hands
and he picks it up and he drops it
and so all the pieces go like that
oh wow
so they both like to take things apart but its like wow
different techniques for getting them there
-um so he likes movement a lot in toys
do you remember what he was most interested in last time
oh gosh
i cant remember but i remember we didnt play with the stuffed animals at all
-um i dont think we played with the food at all
so what was there left books and spoons
he likes spoons a lot
i dont know if there was a ball there last time or if he was even
aware of balls
well what would you say today was like his least favorite thing
did you try to get him to play with something and he just wasnt having it
what did i
maybe the stuffed animal actually
i mean he kind of looked at if for a while
and then turned away
and now youre gonna disprove me but thats okay
it was you know i tried
i didnt do that but
but everything else he picked up he seemed to stay with for a while or do something to you know
-um not just kind of look at it and toss it down really
and would you say this is how you play at home usually
ill spend some time with him on the floor -um
sometimes well you know hide the toys i dont think i did it this time like this and make it go away and then
have it appear again
sometimes hell try to put the toy in my mouth after he takes it
yes and then sometimes we just play with each other
like this
and crawl all over the place
and do little
and do little head bellies
sometimes we do that
so did you notice anything different from the last time
last time he was not in
if if im remembering correctly
books were not so such a big deal to him then
and he was more interested in the stuffed animals and the food
but like one of the biggest differences i think is
its like his interest in more in processes now of turning pages of the book or
putting the cookies into something
and less he still examines everything but he wants to do something with it now
whereas before he just wanted to look at it and taste it
and now hes trying to do something with it
that was the biggest difference i saw
and he likes books
he sits and reads his brothers books
what would you say was his favorite thing today
this book
and the cookies
the farm book and then putting the cookies in
alright you want this back
i know its lunchtime
and like putting the cookies into something
so doing something
and -um do you have that book at home
we dont have this book
-uh we have lots of touch books where you feel
but we do not have that book no
do they have animals in them too
do you think hes familiar with any of the animal names that were in there
i think so
i think -um ducks
because we go and feed ducks all the time so
ducks and probably the cow
you know we look at cows a lot
in books
and sheep i guess
horse is the one that theyre not as familiar with
-um do you think that there is
i mean what was the thing that he liked the least
he was not interested in the stuffed animals
not like last time
no you werent interested in them
did you try to introduce some of them to him
yeah i tried to introduce the zebra
and he kinda touched it
and the frog
he wanted to poke its eye
but he didnt once wanna go over and examine them so
and do you play with stuffed animals at home
we have them at home
but neither him nor his brother like to play them
theyre there
theyll look at them and hug and go away
they dont play with them
-um how about the food
the food
he loved the food
he wanted to taste everything
which is lovely
im sure theyre clean
but he wanted to taste everything
the cookies
the little mm cookies
and the -uh spaghetti
he liked the spaghetti
do you think hes familiar with those names
yeah definitely cookie
and pizza
he knows
yeah that cookies a hit
hes taking the cookie with him everywhere
i was surprised he wasnt as interested with the ah little sippycup
is he working with sippycups now
he has cups yeah
hes a bad flirt
yes you are
youre a bad flirt
what about the baby doll
did you guys play with that
yeah we played with the baby doll
and only at the end he was willing to touch it
he just sat there and smiled at the baby doll
like curious but i dont know if he was a little intimidated by it
i mean he certainly wasnt afraid of the baby doll
but he didnt wanna touch until the end
and then he finally kept touching its mouth
oh okay
but i had it touching his ha his arm
and he would just smile and look at the hand like
we do not have any dolls
so this was kinda fun for him
new for him
yeah i was having it sit next to him and touch his arm and
he would just stare at the arm and smile
i mean im pretty sure he thought it was definitely another baby
he just didnt know what to do with the other baby
except smile at it
and i was surprised he didnt poke the other baby in the eye
you didnt poke the other baby in the eye
whats wrong
are you sitting on things
you sitting on a burger
sitting on a burger
dont get upset
do you have -um pretend food at home
you do
although we dont have pretend cookies or spaghetti or pizza so
and are you playing with the pre
is matthew also playing with you
yeah matthew plays with the pretend food
and he mostly
it has a grill
he goes over and hits the button and turns the grill on
thats what he likes to do
hes gonna be a grill man right
what else did -um he play with
well now hes playing with the spoons
now hes playing with the spoon
i offered him the spoons because he has spoons
and he normally likes them
and he looked at them shook a few times and chucked them
and he tries to feed himself
its a disaster but he tries
yes you try
hes been trying to feed himself since he was six months old
oh wow
hes a little independent guy
both my children are very independent
-um i think i got through all the questions here
is there anything else you thought was interesting in this play session
i think just the biggest things was the shift away from the stuffed animals and more into books
come on
can you navigate the pile of food to get to mommy
distracted by bread
i know youre ready for lunch
-um what do you think he liked playing with the most
this little spaghetti thing and that one and the baby
thats interesting
i do not know why
that he kept these almost the entire time
then he would whack the baby on the head with them
so apparently thats what he really enjoyed to do
-um does he have a baby at home
like a babydoll
he has -uh like little animals but no babies
were a you know a family of boys so we dont have babydolls
dont you dare bch
you come here bch
-um so how does he usually play with his other animals
he usually gnaws on them
gnaws on them
was he doing that with -uh these
yes everything goes in the mouth
so he usually eats anything and
we have one of those rubber like bracelet things
that is big enough that he can chew on it and im not too worried about him being able to chew through it
but he chews everything
so we have a lot of hard toys that he chews on
and he likes to rip paper and eat that and
he has a couple electronic books that hell flip the pages and itll do like music and stuff
oh thats really neat
so di how did he feel about books here
not today
he i was doing a peekaboo book and one of the little -uh papers fell out
and then he got interested because it was something he could chew on
so at home do you use paper books
not with him
aha no but his brothers have paper books
no wires bch
thats usually what we do when youre crawling around huh bch
no wires bch
but we tried this one too and he touched it for an instant and then he was like yeah
then he was just like nope
more interested in the spaghetti thingies and banging them
is that typically what he does at home too
more into toys than books or
yeah for the most part until he realizes again that they make noise and then he likes to smack them and then they make noise some more so
was there anything -um
has any of the books that you read do you think any of the words in it or the stories were familiar to him
well i know like in this one -uh they had ducks and the sheep and stuff and i think he knows that theyre animals
if nothing else
so weve been to a farm before and so they hes seen them before
but i do not know if he really understands like what they are
but i was just trying to get him to touch the soft
because we have cats at home and and theyre soft too huh
when youre nice to them bch
how about the peekababy boo book
we do peekaboo at home
but not with a book
but we do peekaboo and -uh he seems to hes starting to understand that youre still there
so he starts to look around the hands looking for so
oh now youre gonna find other things huh bch
whats that bch
how about the foods is are has he tried these foods or are these any of these foods that you played with today or that you talked about are they foods that youve had at home
he has had -um spaghetti type things at home but not they dont look like this
but hes seen us eat it
-um were just not there yet with him
with the these particular like actual
but hes eaten bread before which is why i was kinda surprised he didnt go for the bread
did you present it to him
yeah i put some something on it
and he just was like whatever
and then he did the same thing that i
i put plates down too because i feed him like green beans and stuff on plates and and he didnt want his spaghetti on the plate
so he took it right back off
huh bch
thats what you did bch
yeah bch
how about any other foods that -um you tried to introduce to him or -um that might be familiar
that he picked up
nope just he was more interested in
well hes got the peas now it looks like
hes had peas before
actual peas he likes to squish them
oh yeah
but yeah no the only things that he was picking up were the the spaghetti
that was it
oh now youre gonna use the spoon huh bch
so today was his first time kinda playing with baby and doing things with baby
well he did that the last time too
oh okay
he noticed the baby the last time also
and was interested
but he plays with his shadow in the window and in the mirror so
and -uh so hes he sees himself and so he knows hes joe and he knows what he looks like
so i think that seeing the baby doll is enough of a lookalike th for him
huh bch
-um what did you notice any differences from his the first time he came and played with these toys
well he seemed to not be as interested in as many things
it seemed last time he was more willing to look at other things that i you know showed him
and this time he had more of an idea of this is what i want and so this is what im going to do
oh thats funny
but he also wasnt mobile last time and so hes mobile now
and so at home usually its you know the wires its always wires with him
he takes after his father
huh bch
yeah bch
are you gonna talk to the baby bch
yeah bch
has he had peanut butter
but he i think he liked the fact that it rolled
mm okay
because i i put it up and he bangs on things so i gave him this and banged on it and hes like no not gonna bang on it today
huh bch
how about any differences between do you have any of these toys at home
just i mean we have a variety of st the stuffed animals but again he wasnt really interested in the stuffed animals
but he did i think recognize the bear
because we have lots of bears at home
and so i think that was something he he recognized but yeah
the rest of it yeah he was more interested in these
things he can shove in his mouth and
that makes sense
things he can chew on
hes got five teeth and he puts them to good use
-um do you think that hes got any -um attraction to color
like -um for example the peas are green and the frog is green and
-um -um were there any trends across color
not really
i dont think
its you know he well hes going for red things now it looks like so maybe hes more interested in red
but his brothers have -uh favorite colors are red and blue right now
so we have a lot of red and blue things
so but even at home when he notices his bib and whats on his bib he has a tendency to if its colorful
like we have elmo ones
he seems to play with the bib more than he wants to eat
okay yeah
so its very possible that he likes red
i always ask parents if its you think its the noise its the texture or the color you know thats really making them gravitate towards particular toys
-um across the different toys
yeah i dont think so
i mean hes now hes more interested just in food in general it looks like
yeah bch
he uses his feet a lot like that
its so funny
he pulls things closer to him with his feet
with his feet
hell hell kick and kick and kick and hes realized that things will come closer to him sometimes
its really funny to watch him
huh bch
yeah bch
yeah bch
-um is there anything -um that you noticed that was different -um this time that you wanna add
i know we kind of talked about it
thats funny because when we play at home honestly when im with him i dont usually play with like the toys
we have a basket of things that he can you know go and play with whenever he wants to and he goes and he you know picks everything out and knocks the basket over and stuff
but he and i we we throw you in the air and
huh bch
yeah bch
weve been working on his crawling more and his standing on his own and and things
but yeah he hes pretty good at just finding things
entertaining himself a little bit
pretty much yeah
hes he doesnt need me which has been a help
thats great
every so often he gets it in his head that he really needs me but for the most part hes pretty independent
i think its because of his brothers because his brothers really entertain him
and i think im not as interesting as they are
well theyre smaller
a little bit smaller yeah
theyre six but
but yeah theyre shorter the
and they tend to -uh not pay as much attention to him sometimes and so hes he gets into more things when theyre around than when i am
oh no
im just surprised he hasnt gone after the wires more
because thats his favorite thing to do
go after wires pull them up pull them chew on them
huh bch
that is your favorite thing to do at home bch
pull on wires bch
thats too big for you bch
thats too big bch
so -um i think thats it
for this portion
of course
so what do think -um she liked the most here today
i mean when she came she played pretty much on this side with the toys
so just the stuffed animals and then the
yeah i mean shes got prob when she walked in the stuffed animals are the first thing she walked over to
she liked the doll but i think that the doll is too big for her
she tried to pick it up but i think its a little too awkward
she has a small babydoll
-um does she play with stuffed animals at home
-um she has stuffed animals at home that shell pull out
i mean in terms of how much playing she has -um
theyre not the little people theyre called animalville
its the same thing but theyre little animal characters
so she has that but shell you know walk around it and stuff and then she has -um between -uh a regular babydoll and then she has one that crawls
thatll shell pretty much entertain herself with but shes back and forth and back and i mean shell walk into her room pull out a toy walk over play with the toy a little bit walk back to her room
so nothing keeps her interest for very long
i mean she definitely likes her dolls
i noticed that shell go and get her dolls
you think she recognized the names of any of the animals that you played with today
maybe dog cause you know we have the dogs at home
so definitely the dog
i mean dog and cat i think are the two that are the most common to her cause thats what we have at the house
-um how about the foods that you may have played with today were there any that she was familiar with or that she really liked or maybe wasnt familiar with
she tried to drink out of the sippycup
which is what she is drinking out of now
i gave her the bottle but she didnt have much interest in it and its been a little while since shes actually had a bottle so i dont know if shes just been
lost interest in it but otherwise
not really
and what about the books do you have any of the same books at home
she has -um not the same but she has a bunch of like the small -um picture books and like the hard books i dont know she has like a bin of books that she can dig into and sometimes ill put her in her crib with just a bunch of books and shell just flip through them for a little while
so usually the books are for like bedtime or like relaxing
sometimes yeah just for relaxing
and then you know -um if i wanna try and get a couple of things done or go take a shower ill put her in the crib with them so that itll entertain her for a while
i know the baby is so big
do you think that the book that you went through she may have recognized or was familiar with some of things that were in that book
i dont know how familiar she is with a lot of you know like because shes not saying anything yet -um
so im not sure shes familiar with it yet
i dont think so
okay -uh were there any differences between this visit and the last visit as far as what toys she liked
she actually sat with me for a book this time which last time i think i tried and she wasnt really having it
was she walking last time
no well how long ago was last time
-uh end of july
july thirtieth
not yet
she starting walking at nine at nine months
a little before nine months
so last time she wasnt into the books what about this time was she not into something
she i mean like she would start here and she went through some of the stuffed animals and threw out the ones that she had no interest in
i mean it was between the fox and the little zebra i noticed that she picked up and carried around and i cant think of anything at home that looks like the two of them
shes cute
thank you
-uh and do you remember what she liked the most last time
i think last time she played a lot with the food
i think she sorted through the food a lot
so this time shes more into like the animals and dolls if you could be
what is that
do you think she is into colors noise or sound
she loves music
shes got a couple of toys at home that you press the buttons and it will play music for her and shh with com like if shes walking by and theres a commercial or a tv show at the end of a show you know sometimes theyll have music at the end of a show shell stop to dance
shes into them thats good
okay is -um is she into any foods now or is she still on like cereal and formula
pretty much whatever we have as long as its not too spicy or we dont give her meat
were trying not to give her trying really hard not to give her meat
-um but so i mean shell eat whatever were eating
she still has a sippycup and ill put cereal in the
lots of fruit
right lots of fruit
so probably like you know the ice cream cone
is probably not too familiar
like i mean shell like the little animal crackers or i was gonna say like even the cookies here she doesnt eat any of these kinds of cookies
i guess the sippycup she picked up and tried to drink out of
so that i think she recognized as
okay i think thats it for the questions
i just wanted to get a feel for what was going on in the play session
doesnt taste very good
can you give a kiss
give a kiss
im ready to ask you some questions
-um well first of all what did she seem to like to play with
well lets see here
the pizza
the pink icecream
not the white icecream
she liked the keys only after i gave them to her though
that that cup and then back to the bottle
this is like always a staple
so im thinking
we recently have gotten into giving her the bottle
trying to wean her from breastfeeding
and so she sees th her bottle and gets excited
and maybe thats why shes -uh you know drawn to this one
she may recognize thats a bottle
mhm and she saw the liquid in there and shes trying to get to it
but its not real so she doesnt know that
but -uh still she keeps going back to the bottle
out of all these toys the bottle
well shes showing her preference huh
but she did play with th a few other things
oh yeah -um
she likes pooh
again we have pooh at home so she
but when i went to go give her the duck she
same reaction as this
well not as as intense as the bee
i dont think she likes dark colored -um i dont know
i i hate to associate black with scary but i think she just doesnt know
i think that colors are more vibrant and less threatening to her for some reason
i dont know why
-um even this one didnt give her the bad reaction that this duck did
and then of course she just doesnt
i think thats a texture thing
those little tentacle things
she doesnt like that
like a darker one
yeah i did
the -um otter
and she didnt cower away from it
but you know this i dont know what the difference is
but she did not like this one
and the zebra
she was a little leery of the zebra
but -um but the otter
when she i was trying to get her when she was hugging pooh
trying to switch her up to get her to hug the otter
she wouldnt hug the otter
no way
so do so is it mainly just pooh that she seemed to like
that she hugged and kissed
go ahead momma
i see you
how about the dog
did she do
-um she liked the pink poodle
yeah she liked the poodle
but she might just be like her sister
a pink fanatic
she could be
and al you know childrens toys are often colorful
so she may just be useta that
to the colors
because this is pretty
youre doing so good
but i dont know i think this is pretty
but thats me as an adult
i can
its hard
i see what you mean
theyre trying to make it look realistic
but most childrens toys are really colorful
are really colorful
hope you like that
and she did like the pizza
-um and oh the green peas for a long time until they fell out of her reach
you like that
and how about any other of the -um food items
she picked up the pastrami
but it was just whatever trying to get to something else
yeah she did mess with the cookies this time
i know last time she had the cookies in her hand a lot
-um but she did like the pizza
and th and this is you know significantly smaller than pizza that we eat
so but maybe she recognizes the shape of it
yeah i wonder
but we dont eat pizza a lot
so i cant image that you know she knows what anything what this is
maybe she just likes the colors
and and the fact that its kind of -um pliable kind of you know soft
aha and she is teething so maybe when she put it in her mouth it helped her
she didnt wanna look at the book
she did not
she liked the -um only the peekaboo because we play peekaboo
you know and once i started to say you know and show her
and then she she you know shes like yeah i like that
but at first she didnt want anything to do with it
i hadta come back to it a second time for her to to see that
its great that you showed her a range of things
you showed her everything
yeah i wanted her to see everything
just so we could get an idea of what makes her tick a little bit and
yeah she looked at the clock and she tried to take the eye off
you can see that thats been done so many times too
thats right it useta actually have hands
mhm im sure
it has a soft kind of texture
how about this
an eagle
mm i dont know
do you like it
dropped your pea
lets see
okay so if theres anything else
does she like anything
these are sposta be kind of like blocks
oh gotcha
did she like
well i was trying to show her the peanut butter
but you know i dont know if she associates the word with what it is
yo her sister is only just now coming into being able to have peanut butter
so -um you know she doesnt get exposed to it a whole lot
she hasnt heard that word so much
lets see -um
but when you mention that they are blocks
they do make a noise
look at that quinn
i dont know if they are
but some of the kids treat them like blocks
they yeah
so ive thinking of them like that
and theyre really flat yeah
they can be stacked
look at that
yeah you could put them like that
dont you
maybe the next visit youll do that
you see
some kids pick up these and then
yeah see
you see
how did i not know it
oh it gives
okay and i think
oh and then -um the baby
did she
yeah hm not so much
not so much
she she looked like hm okay
i tried to giv show her the bottle
she took the bottle from me and didnt wanna deal with the baby
so no no takes on the baby
no takes on the baby
i guess thats a good sign
yep yeah
does she have toys like these at home
yeah she does
she has a lot of stuffed animals
she has several babies
-um but they are a lot smaller tha you know -um this one is more almost close to her size
i know
but she has several babies that are -um probably a you know maybe a little about this size or a little bit bigger
-um she also has some little babies too that you know but
they have diapers and bottles and even has a little stroller that she likes to play with
wow she has
but -um she has blocks and her sisters legos
she likes to play with those and make a mess and throw them all over the place
but this walking
she just took her like first few independent steps last night
and now you cant tell her she cant walk
thats great
thats thats gonna be
youre gonna be doing that all the time now
now that you know you can
i see you
and she does a little i did it dance
go do it
can you do i did it dance
so proud
big girl
youre a big girl
youve covered everything
i think you know our questions because you covered everything
or i dont know
im a teacher too
oh thats why
so i try to analyze things
i was gonna say
i have questions and you answered everything so
i can appreciate what it is youre doing
yeah thats why
you are a teacher
that makes a difference
and the way you showed her things
yeah mhm
you put things together for her and how they work together
although i dont work with the prim
i work with sixth grade so
but still
there must be something in just being a teacher
woah look at you girl
i see you
i see you
well lets -um turn these things off and then she can have a new toy
she prob im glad she probably forgot about that new toy
so i just have a couple questions for you
last time he was really interested in the stuffed animals
-um which i thought was odd because he doesnt really play with stuffed animals at home
but this time he completely ignored them
what did he seem the most interested in this time
this time i was really surprised that he went for this first
because last time he didnt really care about it
you dont have any dolls at home
-um and last time the thing he was most interested in were the food things
like the peas i remember he really liked
im not sure he knows its food
i think its nice to chew on
everything goes in his mouth
and he also really liked the keys last time
-um which we didnt actually have before our visit
-um but after the visit we ended up going and buying him some keys
and -um he usually loves books
and i think its because theres all these new toys he s just doesnt care about the books
but at home we read a lot
so you dont think he recognizes the names of any of these
i dont think so no
not yet
i mean he eats peas
but im not sure that he knows what they look like because he usually eats them mashed up
hes just kinda started to eat them as finger food
the spaghetti
which i mean he has pasta
hes never had spaghetti
so i really dont think he knows that thats spaghetti
i think he just likes to chew on it
no i was wondering that
but i dont think he can
okay oh you want my pen
the other thing i thought was really interesting
and i dont know if this couldve been just me trying to do it more
but it looked like he was trying to put the food onto the plate
which surprised me because he doesnt
hes still too young
i mean if we cut up food that he uses as finger food we just put it on his tray of his highchair
i mean if i gave him a plate hed chuck it onto the floor
but that coulda just been me wishing
okay and the animals do you think he recognizes any of the animals names
or the books
i dont think so yet
do you have any of these toys at home
-um weve got keys
weve obviously got books
and -um we have stuffed animals
but none of these specific ones
but we dont have any food toys yet
hah look what i just spotted
theres a ball here that i didnt even notice
balls are usually his favorite
jack look at what we missed
now if we had noticed that we probably wouldve played with that the whole time
thats okay
so is the next one at one year
or is it at like eighteen months
this is your second visit right
oh so next month
and then the fourth one will be when hes
haha good times buddy
look at this ball
good job jack
thank you so much for being so good
i have a few questions now
-um was there a group of toys that she enjoyed playing with the most
shes playing with the food toys right now
is there anything particular in the food group that she wanted
the cookies
the icecream
you wanna read the book again bch
and the hamburger
left foot left foot right foot right bch
okay -uh was there anything that she was least interested in do you think
i dunno
i do not know
mckayla you cannot eat the hamburger bch
-uh does she have any toys like this at home that she plays with
but she has mostly blocks
she has mostly her brothers toys
and a lot of stuffed animals
but -uh
and how old is her brother
so what types of toys does he have that she plays with
-um trucks and cars and you know
he doesnt like girly toys and she wants to play with his toys
and dogs
see she likes the teddy bears
no you cant eat the doggie bch
cant eat the doggie bch
you wanna kiss the doggie bch
dogs are not pink bch
and does she pay attention when youre reading the book
yeah she does
and does she have books at home
is there -uh one that you read to her a lot
i read different books but they like doctor seuss
but shell pay attention at night to the entire story
-um do you ever play with pretend food or anything like that at home
does she have any of those
we dont pretend with the food
theyre gonna eat it
do you think she recognizes the names of any of the food
she knows what the cookie is
she definitely knows what this is
she knows
thats why she had it for so long
and she knows what the pizza is
she knows -um let me see
she knows most of her foods by by sight and by word
so if you say you wanna cookie shes gonna sit there and look for the cookie and then shes gonna see if its a type of cookie that she wants
she knows what she wants
say and that looks like the cookies that i like bch
its chocolate chip bch
-um is she using utensils or anything are you trying to get her to use utensils or anything yet
am i sposta
oh i do not know im just wondering
i do not know either i know her brother does but
sometimes they like to play with some of those
she plays with the utensils but not at feeding time
i was just wondering
i gotta cookie in my bag bch
-uh do you think she knows the names of any of the stuffed animals that you were pointing out
she knows probably the name of a dog
everything else i dont even know the name of so
and maybe a bee
and maybe a zebra
but other than this i dont even know what these animals are
you should have little cheat sheets for the parents
like -um what is this
what is this
you think its an otter right
what is this
yall are terrible yall should know these names
what is this
looks like a character from a movie
it does but what is it
i dont feel bad then
hold on
what is this
i think thats another otter
alright im gonna give you that one because -um i thats what i assumed but i wasnt sure
hold on
see some of these critters we dont even know what they are so how are we gonna teach them
okay i know what that is
okay i know what th
i just didnt know these three
okay i know what thats a fox
yeah yall should take -um animal lessons
so you can tell us when were wrong
im ready
-um i noticed that you were saying some of the sounds like what the dog said and stuff like that
do you think she recognizes
they do
that they do
because when they start seeing them live they go mama
say when i learn how to talk ill already know what they are bch
and -um does she have any of these books at home
she has goodnight moon
-um she has doctor seuss but i dont have this one
i dont have these this one either
-um i they have this childrens club books and they send me books all the time
so a lot of them are like hard like red
like last night i read them it was called the red book
and its everything red and youre just talking about you know apples and strawberries and and you know anything thats red
and then you just read them red
and then one night you read them yellow and
you know theyll sit there and pretend like theyre listening
you hungry bch
say i must be bch
ill go feed you bch
say i still have a cookie bch
she still has the cookie
thats a shame
thats icecream bch
mm bch
mm bch
icecream bch
and theres my cookie bch
no its not caillou bch
say caillou bch
caillou bch
so you said that you read her a lot of books at home do you think that she prefers to listen to the books or does she like to play with her toys or
at night they
i think its because they dont wanna go to sleep it could be
but theyll sit there intently when you read the book
if she didnt have all this distraction shell just sit there and let you read the book to her
and then sometimes you think shes talking or whatever shell get the book and look at it and you know try to play with it
thats a bear bch
say bch
is she ready about that time
yeah she has a little bit of an attention span but
say hello
so -um with regards to the last time you were here did you notice any difference with what she wanted to play with the toys
oh yeah
last time i dont think she knew what was what
-um at all
i remember last time just showing her things and
her just kind of looking at them
but i mean i think she was in the bumbo seat last time so she couldnt move anywhere
now she kind of you know she wants to touch everything
so definitely a big difference
she can you know somewhat participate in like the books or playing or
you know show some reaction
what were some of the toys -um
like that
mm im sure any of the food i gave her she put in her mouth last time
maybe holding onto a stuffed animal
i dont think she really did anything with the books last time
and neither time she didnt she didnt seem interested in the babydoll
the babydoll just hasnt
yeah no it means i guess nothing to her
-um what do you think was her favorite thing this time
-uh probably putting the food in her mouth
the play food
do you think she recognized the names of any of the food items
-uh doubtful
i dont i dont think so
which food items did you play with today
the pizza slices
she played with this
the waffles i think she was banging together
i think she mightve been interested in the liquid
in h in this one
and in this one
she mightve touched this
i think that was it
i dont think we
played with any other food items
and so you dont have food items at home like pretend
actually i remember her play with
because we have these exact ones at home
this and we have the waffles
and s the bottle
at home
so she mightve recognized those
does she eat any of these foods
i mean
yeah but everything i give her its like cut up really small so it doesnt resemble
you know any of these
you know the way they are
the way these are now
but yeah i mean she pretty much eats everything
as long as i just like cut it up in tiny pieces for her
-um and then so you also played with animals today
-uh were there any other specific ones that she may have known the names of or
-um just the dog
i dont think shed recognize any other names but
she kindve when we say dog and like shell look around and look for our dog
so -um
but that mightve been it i dont think she would recognize any of these other ones
the none of the zoo animals
well we havent really gone over
those maybe the duck
like we you know kind of gone over farm animals with her
but none of these other ones yet
and which ones do you which one do you think is her what do you think was her favorite book today
this one definitely this one
with the touching
-um shh shes usually not interested in books
at all
but if theyre like more interactive ones
and this one has something she could touch
and do you have any of these books at home
we have the foot book
and we have good night moon not this exact good night moon
but -um
i dont know how often shes heard them
probably not
enough for her to like remember it
you know maybe i dont a handful of times shes into foot book
so because what happens is we have a three year old
so isabelle
oh watch that
isabelle gets stuck with whatever were doing with sophia
she kind of
thats what her activity is
oh okay
thats nice
-um how about this activity playing like
the peek a oh yeah because she knows peek a boo
isabelle let me
what are you doing sorry
excuse me
back here sweetie
there you go
-um she really loves peek a boo
so having so even when we just say peek a boo
hold on
i know
look theres so many things here for you to play with
even us just saying peek a boo she gets a big smile on her face so
i dont know if she quite understood that you know that the flaps up were peek a boo but
she liked hearing it
kept her entertained
if you hadta name one item that was a lot different from last time that she played with this time what would that be
oh and she seemed really interested in this
but she didnt have much
i dont think she had much interest in last time
i guess really any of the stuffed animals like just
putting them up to her and shed hug them
shed smile
but last time she didnt really do that
you think it was more the names or the sound effects
the my sound effects
yeah i think so
but i dont think shed like would have recognized frog versus bee
-um do you have babydolls at home
we do
but she
i dont know ive never seen her play with a babydoll
so theyre her sisters babydolls
oh okay
so but -um ive never seen her play with them
shes not into them yet
not yet
alright -um and is there i think we probably asked this last time -um but so is there a toy that seems to match her personality the most
out of these or just in general
out of these
fits here personality
i mean
the stuffed animals i mean shes a really cuddly baby
so i think she likes
so i think being able to hug the stuffed animals
thats -um
that kind of fits her
her personality
okay i think that is it oh wait
so do you think she prefers the toys over the books
she doesnt at home we probably dont
read to her as much as we should we might get like one of these books in a day to her
which is like
yeah she likes that
which is like maybe you know these books take like ten fifteen seconds to read you know
you know i feel like shes just not as exposed
to books
but this stuff is like laying around our house
-um because we have a play kitchen and so shes always like picking it up and putting it in her mouth
oh okay
oh you do have a play kitchen
yeah we do have play kitchen
yeah we have the play food not j all of these things just a few of these items
or similar to ones we have at home
thats nice
what is that just out of curiosity one of her favorite foods
to eat
oh boy -uh
this girl will eat anything
actually shes -um
i guess her favorites just because we
feed it to her a lot -um
like the corn casserole that comes in the baby jars
the oatmeal cereal thats for babies
she liked that
she likes cheese
likes crackers
actually i havent found anything that she does not like
and so i mean were pretty much feeding her the scope of you know
pretty much everything we ever have
isabelle you cant play with that
so maybe the next visit shell recognized the food
maybe yeah we should probably start showing her the foods
that were like feeding her maybe shell pick up on it
oh isabelle aw
well we really appreciate you working with us
oh yeah absolutely
if you could just do me a favor
today is june fifteenth two thousand nine and her date of birth is seven eighteen eight
i appreciate it
yeah no problem
what did she seem most interested in today
the ice cream cone
without a doubt
any idea why
-um i think
the texture on those gums
plus its just a good shape for her hand to grasp on to
was she interested in any of the other foods
a little bit into the pizza
-um again you know its got that texture on it and its a nice size for her little hands but
she was really into those ice cream cones today
and she liked the kangaroo
thats the puppet
she likes puppets a lot
do you like puppets maggie
its interesting to me because my other daughter
is and always had been since
she was maybe two to three months old
huge book fan
so i would think
because that shed have
tremendous language skills but shes actually very speech delayed
and this one really could care less about books
but her babbling and everything else like that is developing at a much more normal schedule
i guess you never know
no well i mean you know itll i think
when theyre older the book worm will probably have a better vocabulary
but as far as the development of the language it hasnt made a bit of difference
do you have any of these play foods at home
we do but they havent been of interest to the kids yet
they just came at christmas time so
theyre still into other things
yah i mean weve got some puppets
puppets and plush toys are the popular things in our house right now
and weve got the karen katz books and dr seuss
so those were all very familiar and she didnt pay any attention at all to those
does she use utensils
she tries to use her spoon
mostly she just plays with her spoon
i can see that maggie
are any of these foods that she likes when theyre real
peas she likes peas
shes never seen as peas
she sees them as mushy green globs
really she hasnt seen much of anything
well she had some pasta
last night with some ground up sauce in it
so this kind of looks dinner last night
and she played with that for a moment
im sure shes sandwiches
well she gets waffles too
but she sees them as little pieces
so i dont know that would register
-um anything else
no she probably doesnt see as it appears like that
what animals did you
i heard you guys playing with some of the animals
yah we played with the otter
and we played with
with the zebra and the kangaroo
we played with the baby
she loves the babies in her daycare classroom
and shes much bigger than they are
she sort of steam rollers them
but she just wants to love them and kiss them
and hug them
and thats what she tried to do with that one
it looked a bit like c p r
do you guys have a lot of stuffed animals at home
yah she likes those a lot
her sisters baby dolls
she likes those a lot
she likes to just sort of drag them by the arm around the room
do you wanna be
dragged by your arm around the room maggie
nope she just wants to me in charge
what do you have
is that the spaghetti
usually it takes them a while to learn to say that one
thats a big one
i think my brother was saying until he was six or seven
oh yah
lets just call it pasta
thats easier
okay maggie
turn everything off we are all done
which of the toys do you think was her favorite
probably this bee
she liked the whatever it is the sticky kind of
which do you think she liked the least
-um probably the books
i tried to get her interested in the books
and she didnt really
so do you think she likes more
what do you think she likes more
the toys or the books
-um probably toys
she reads like
or she doesnt read
but she plays with her books at home
but she has a shorter attention span with them
probably not
-um we have like the little stuffed animals and -um the books
but we dont have any of the like kitchen toys
and she has baby dolls
but she doesnt play with them yet
do you think she recognizes any of like the food items
mm probably not
shes still on -um like baby food and formula
so we dont really -um give her any food
and we usually eat when shes down for her nap unless were out so
she might recognize that bottle with the orange juice or whatever it is
does she have any dolls
-um yeah she doesnt really play with them yet
theyre just kind of hanging out in her room
-um she plays a lot with like the teether rings
-um sometimes shell eat them
but sometimes shell just bang them around on stuff
and -um she has a stuffed elmo
and she loves to play with that and like talk to him
like shes talking to winnie the pooh
and -um she likes to play with
-um she likes rattles a lot
stuff that make noise
she likes that kind of stuff
-um i think the keys were probably the thing that grabbed her attention the most
-um like she has a set of keys at home
but -um i dont think really any of the other toys made enough noise for her to even notice
-um no
this is pretty much how she is
we have two dogs at home though that kind of sit and hang out with her
and she plays with them too
but this is pretty much how she is at home so
sounds good
giovanna can play with him a little bit
so do you think there were particular toys that he liked more
he liked the bee
why do you think that is
-um he likes soft things on his face especially
and i think this really interesting texture was interesting to him
i know if i put my hair on his face he loves it
of course then he grabs it
but he loves it
maybe not quite such a good thing to do here
but no he likes soft textures
and he likes kind of funky textures so
yeah i noticed you tended to go toward the stuffed animals
and so did he not like say the food items
do you play with any food items at home or
-uh no were mostly soft stuff still
-um because hell grab something especially if its got an edge and just do it real quickly
so i dont want him to
its more of a safety
safety thing yeah
going with the soft stuff
-um were there any toys that you thought he particularly didnt like
no we didnt try very many of them
i just picked to what we generally play with at home so
but i dont think there was anything he disliked
are there particular ones of these that you actually do have yourself
-uh i dont see anything familiar
i mean we have stuffed toys but
but not those particular toys
and we have a book like this but
does he generally prefer books or toys
or does he play a bunch with books
-um he plays with books
and daddy reads to him every night
but he just kind of sits there
like he doesnt really play with them
weve got mostly feely type ones and popup books and stuff like that
but he prefers toys and -um things that dangle
mhm -um what about dolls
do you have any
no we dont have any
-um i think theres one in daycare
one of the girls at daycare have one
but we dont have
and thats not something thats ever interested him
some kids really get into babies
yeah no not yet
it seemed like he was struggling to get to things
well thats something we do at home too is we put things kind of far away
so he hasta work to get to them
-um because were working on moving and you know locating and crawling and stuff like that and direction driven
you know if he wants it he hasta go get it
so if were home if he wants his pacifier well put it just out of his reach
and well make him you know kind of crawl to get to it
and sometimes he decides he doesnt want it and goes off to another
which is fine too because he likes his pacifier
you know we dont care either way
i dont want a two year old with a pacifier so haha
but mostly just getting him to
to move and to yeah
and to put the
if i go get something
and then its over there then its over here
then he can go get it
are there particular books
you said that your husband read to him every night
are there like favorites in the family
-um doctor seuss
-um hop on pop and fox in socks and a couple of those
i think daddy prefers those more than he does but haha
i think my husbands favorite book is still fox in socks so
you seem to be getting into that now huh
you seem to be getting into that now huh
haha you gonna start crawling
yeah he gets up
then he goes down
but he does the army crawl
okay im gonna ask you some questions then
-um you wanna stand up so she cant get your clipboard
okay so what toys do you think she liked the most
she really liked the spaghetti especially since there were two and they matched
i dont if she had seen the placemats she would have liked those too because shes really into things being the same
see look aha two
see look at that
do you have any like play food toys at home
-um no not that she plays with
-um we have lots of books
we have some stuffed animals but she mostly ignores them
her favorite toys are like puzzle toys and s like squish if youve heard of that
its kinda three dimensional sort of thing
-um she likes putting things in and taking things out of her shape sorter
i mean she has a really simple shape sorter that has an open thing in the front and then it has shapes on the sides
and shell try to put things in the sides but she cant get but
-um she likes her stacking rings
she likes anything she can bang
yes i know theyre two and theyre the same yay
isnt that cool
as you see she matches
does she have any of these books at home
yeah -uh she has mister brown can moo
she has foot book
she has put me in the zoo
-um do we have baby
no we dont have baby
we have other ones by the same author that look very similar but not baby
-um she has good night moon but not good night moon one two three
and she i dont think we have any touching books
does she have any of the stuffed animals
-um none of those stuffed animals
i mean we have some but she mostly ignores them
shes not terribly interested in them
do you think she would recognize body parts
oh absolutely
hey well as you saw she grabbed the nose whenever i told her to grab the nose
oh youre too busy banging
youre not gonna do it are you
she knows nose mouth eyes cheek -um
sometimes shell grab ear
sometimes shell blow you off
-um yeah she knows body parts
she knows hand -um foot
does she have any dolls at home
no as you saw that would terrify her
she was looking
i know it was a scary baby
its dead
who put that dead baby here
what did she like the most
but -um the spaghetti during the official time
she liked the spaghetti a lot
because like i said their are two they match so
and she could bang matching things together which is awesome
you find two things that match and you bang them together right
yes thats right
what would you say she liked the least
-um the baby
i think abject terror was definitely dislike
do you think she likes books or toys the most
-um it depends on what mood shes in
-um -uh these things here shed probably tire of most the things pretty quickly unless except for the matching stuff
-um but -uh yeah i mean i she crawls over to books any time she sees them
and pats them and then eats them but
she adores books
shell even like if her -uh older brothers being read to or if hes reading to her shell sit in somebodys lap and just spaz out over the book so
no cause we never do that with her
im sure she doesnt
besides what sound does a deer make
thats right you found a fun toy didnt you
now that theyve stopped officially counting
no they had two of them and you could bang them
does she have any of these toys at home
any similar like texture or
-um no we dont have any thing really like
we have colored plastic shapes and wooden shapes of all sorts
because you know in general shes very shape focused so you know
if you dont mind i wanted to ask a couple of questions
the play session
lets see
hey you
which toys do you think that
he liked the most
he seemed to like the dog a lot
i do not know thats cause its the first one or
what haha
where there any that you found that he
not really
he did his typical
thing with the book where sometimes we come up with pictures
and other times he just wants it closed
and just eats around haha
do you think that
-uh do you think that he likes toys or books
it depends on
the time of day and
he is how tired he is
seems to huh
or it
maybe its just our routine and what im
usually doing
with him
i dont usually sit and try to read books with him
unless his brothers napping
because its just
too difficult
are there any specific books at home
you have similar
but we
go to the library and weve
lots of like board books
do you
play -um
like activities and do you guys do anything
or games or
not planned
just kinda spread out
nothing -um
were not doing preschool or anything
i know
i know
i thought -um
the food items
do you think he recognized any of them
you couldnt imagine
well everything he gets is pureed
right now
it doesnt look like
that i mean hes been eating peas for days on end
i dont think theres any recognition at all
we dont even know
what really peas look like
and then any stuffed animals
maybe that he
hes seen dogs before
and maybe thats why he
or seemed to prefer that over the frog
or seemed more interested
he hasnt see frogs haha
but we have a couple of
different dog
animals as well as you know
friends have
real dogs
we didnt really
try anything else
do you think that -um
do you guys play with dolls maybe or
-um ha
not at the moment
we kind of rotate
the toys out
we have one
baby doll and
shes been
or he whoever
it has been packed up
okay -um
i think
let me try to think what else you may have played with
you did choose to play with that book as opposed to
these was that just the closest one
it was
sorry about that
yeah it was the closest one
we do have doctor seuss books but not
board books
so they wouldnt be ones i would think
for him
because hes all about
haha so
i dont wanna do that with the
older books
typically at this age right
and they go in his mouth
it hasta be a board book or a plastic
you know
because otherwise its just destroyed
and then i guess he was playing with the keys and
we played
a little bit
did you think he recognized
i dont know
i dont know if he recognizes or if its just easy to hold onto
he does have a few things that have rings
and i guess
-uh in a large sense he does have his own
keys like they dont look anything like keys to me but theyre sposta be
you know
keys on a ring haha
he could be
youre into peanut butter
alright well i think
i think thats it i think we got through
i really appreciate your time
coming in
well okay were gonna do the questions again
the cookie was far superior to all the other toys
oh really
cookie is the winner
cookies the winner
oh okay -uh so she was interested in the foods i guess overall
yeah i think the plastic food toys were the ones i mean she did grab the book first but she went to the cookie and that was her thing
okay -um okay so same questions -uh which toy would you say is a good toy for her personality
or the best toy
the cookie
okay what about which did she seem least interested in
the book
i mean she grabbed it but then she wasnt interested she didnt wanna read the book
she want it and then realized there were other things that were better to chew on and
so did she look at the animals you said
a little bit yeah she spent some time with the frog and with the donkey and spent a little time with them and then went back to the food stuff
okay -um
so would you say shes interested in books or toys or is it still the same thing too early to say
-um shes interested in both books and toys today she preferred toys
alight -um
but at home sometimes she prefers the books you know it just depends on her mood
okay i think we answered all the questions -uh before but -um is there anything different about the way she plays at home
-uh did you wanna tell us or baby toys or anything
-um she spends more time on her back playing with a toy up like this
oh okay
than her sister does -um
i mean as you can see she plays on her stomach also -um
but a lot of times shell just be on her back and shell hold a toy up and play with it like that
oh okay
well i think that is it then
participant five eight three seven today is nine fifteen two thousand nine
where you going bch
-um so what do you think -um she liked to play with today
the doll and the keys have been her fascination today
what bch
yeah bch
how was she playing with them
how were you engaging her to play
-um the doll im not sure she was getting
the doll was confusing
she kinda wanted to play with it but seemed frustrated with it
-um so just kinda talking to her about what she had
-um of course everything that goes to the mouth
so the keys were great because its teething time so any toy that goes to the mouth is a fabulous toy
yes bch
oh now you found the mic bch
i was waiting for that bch
-um trying to show her just a couple different things
-um just so so she saw what was around
but she tended to go back to those few
mostly the doll the key
a little bit of the food
right bch
-um would you think she picked out particular -um like colors of keys or do you think it would
i think she found what it was the blue one and i guess just something grabbed her eye on that one
but i dont think it was color related
i dont
because we didnt realize there were other ones till the last couple minutes
you said that she played with some of the food items
were there some that you think that shes beginning to recognize the names of or do you think she was attracted to some items that have the colors
hm i dont think it was recognition of food from home
would it be the colors
or just i would say vicinity but its not vicinity because she can get around
i do not know if its the shape
to fit in your hand well
what would we say
you know it tended to be the brighter colors so maybe colors
youre making me work here
think about this
im sorry
no its okay its fine
-um do you have pretend food at home
and she doesnt have a big doll like that so i was thinking oh i might have to go get a doll for her because shes got two brothers at home older brothers so most of the toys are not what most people would say girly toys
-um so there is one babydoll in the house but i dont think its even out where she would be able to find it and play with it
so it made me think i might needta go get her something like that because she seemed to gravitate right towards that one
but no
no food
thats not true
we do have fake food but not like kid food
we have fake like -um fruit
big size regular fruit food but
they dont know about that
so you were saying that she probably doesnt recognize any of those foods from the foods at ho
or the names of it
or even the look i guess
probably not
i mean do we have pizza at home
yes we eat pizza but shes not exposed to it
-um a plate maybe
but again youre not using plates
well youre using a bowl but its not that close to you
so i dont think its recognition yet i dont think its familiar
probably more like the shape and texture maybe of the jars
like put them together or
no the jars might be more similar just like just of the toys the shape at home
and it fits in her mouth so
yeah is that funny bch
because what do you play with at home
you play with you play with a lot of big kid toys
i know bch
she plays with a lot of cars
she plays with
she plays with her brothers cars
-um right bch
its mostly actually the boys stuff upstairs not yours
so it is yours
-um oh i know bch
im sorry i wiped your noise bch
not nice bch
not nice thing to do mom bch
how about -um did you play with any of the stuffed animals
i tried to play a little bit with the word world ones but she was not into it
she wanted to go back the keys or the doll
a couple times i tried to change them to the the stuffed animals or the book and she just didnt want those
wasnt interested in those today
im sorry you said she has stuffed animals at home
i i was just trying to bring them in today to change her -um the toys she was playing with just to kinda show her other things
i grabbed these and i grabbed this one
and then i grabbed a book and wasnt too in into those too much
now we do the stuffed animals that he will play with smaller things like this
not this one but like a little stuffed animal
have you begun to like introduce their names
do you think that she recognizes what some of the animals would be if you produced them
absolutely not
-um one because like i said she doesnt really play with them and i just i dont shes gotten the concept
i think shes starting to recognize maybe when we talk about like sitting down to eat
and i think she recognizes when we talk about like the family
a little bit
-um but i dont think shes at that point yet
and maybe im underestimating you but i dont think you do bch
i dont bch
i dont bch
so you you said you guys -um looked at some books
do you have some of these books at home
we have put me in the zoo
we have the foot book but we have them in the bigger versions
-um shes never seen this one
but we do
we read books
she will grab books sometimes and just kinda play with the pages
so she is familiar with books
yes bch
so i would say you kinda recognize a book because we play with those
right bch
not at all
not at all
the keys really i mean these were fascinating her
right bch
you just like those bch
thats what exactly why
what bch
and maybe if i had shown her the book when she wasnt fascinated with the other toy
instead of trying to change her fo to or her focus
right bch
you had no interest in this book bch
and now youre gonna be interested in eating bch
not today bch
how about any none of the books
no she didnt seem to wanna read this one either
or listen
do you play pattycake and games like that or interact with her
well do
sometimes we do some
we will do -um itsy-bitsy spider
we will do abcs with sign language
-um we do open shut them
right bch
no no pattycake really
but well sing the song open shut them and do the hands with it yes
and then we do abcs and we do sign language so you can follow the hands with that
-um other hand plays no
we do little rhyming songs and
oh excuse you
lets see which one
ride a horsie into town bch
just be careful you dont fall down bch
and thats one we like to do
and our brothers usually get involved too
ride a horsie into town bch
just be careful you dont fall down bch
so some of that kind of repetitive play
or songs
do you think she rec thought -uh the doll was another baby when interacting with it
i wasnt sure
i thought maybe
and thats why i wasnt sure if thats why she was getting frustrated
because it wasnt really responding to her
so i didnt know if it was something like you know its kinda of her size and maybe it looked familiar
and like she would smile at it and then shed kinda go like grunt would sound is frustrating
so i didnt know if she like thought it was something that should be playing with her
versus her playing with it just soley
what is that over there bch
what is this thing bch
and so yeah i was trying to figure out what what was going through her head
because it was like i want you but then it was like
youre not doing what i want you to do whatever it was that she wanted
right bch
what is that bch
what is this bch
i mean she definitely was doing what she does to us
she pokes at her eyes she pulls at the hair
she grabs hair
so like that grunt
its like shes frustrated
so i do not know if she expects it to respond differently
did you guys play with any of the articles of clothing or -um i do not know
we took off a shoe
or i took off the shoe
but she had no interest in that
she seemed to notice a band aid but
shes really upset with it
shes like come play with me
come do something
what is it you want it to do bch
do you want her to sing talk back to you bch
stand up like you do bch
lets see i think shes sposta do something different bch
is it like a little baby girl bch
give you kisses bch
does she give kisses and hugs and
shell just give her squeezes
but no kisses
youre not a yet bch
thats not true
well lean her over and shell just like open her mouth and drool on you
to give you a kiss
and you know her brothers really love that one
so she will
well like kinda lean her in for good night kisses
okay bch
okay bch
and as we talk im gonna nurse her so i hope you dont mind
no not at all
-um color maybe
sound there were no real sounds in todays toys
it does get her attention some at home some of the noises
-um wow
what is it that attracts you to these toys bch
i mean we could talk about like the difference between some of
like the plastic food is harder -um than the stuffed animals
i mean the food and i guess the key were
i mean these were kind of hard and soft
kinda squeezy
good for teething
and so maybe things that are just good to chew on
i mean she probably likes that harder stuff when it all goes to the mouth
-um they were the right size for her to pick up
so to be able to grasp and hold and play with they were a good size
-um it actually felt different
and i think its one because theres such a variety right here
and there were no other distractions which is not very typical at home
-um so i was actually surprised that she wasnt more mobile
i thought she was gonna kinda go around and check out the chairs
or move around to other toys than actually sit fairly fairly still here
so that kinda surprised me
that she was actually engaged in the toys
even i mean that she just wanted stayed in this one vicinity
and it was all right in front of her so she didnt have to go far
because there were no other real distractions
which you know like i said usually at home its her brothers
or were i guess not sitting with her for fifteen straight minutes at a time
-um which sounds bad as i say that but reality is you know it just doesnt happen as much at home
so it was interesting to watch her just kinda sit here
and play with just a couple
and stay in a fairly small area
does she play with each toy the same way as she would at
does she explore them the same way or did you find yourself since it was new kind of -um prompting her differently or you know
i mean the way she played seemed fairly simi familiar or similar that the way we do at home
you know we talk about what shes playing with
and then sometimes we just let her kinda go with you know without the prompts or without the the talking
the narrative to it
you know we try to kind of you know go over oh its the pizza or oh youve got blue key
so its not forced
kind of let her play on her own
was there anything -um any of the items here that you think
i know i keep asking you in different ways the same question
its okay
that you think -um she was familiar with or even new kind of some new items that
well stuffed animals i would say is pretty new
im what did i say the b
sorry the babydoll
not the stuffed animals
books familiar
-um food new
im just trying to think of if it would be similar to even though we dont have food but the shape to another toy at home
no i think theyre pretty novel for what we have
-um trying to think of the toys that have been upstairs that shes been playing with a lot
because we have a lot of blocks like square soft blocks that she plays with
-um what else do you like to play with bch
youre at your table top toy more
so thats you know stationary
-um a lot of novelty for her
the stuffed animals even at home she doesnt play with too much
i mean theyre there
but its not one of her go to toys
okay so well not everything but a lot of it could have been potentially new
unique and kind of
yeah and like new like words like presenting them in isolation
this is a that kind of thing
that funny bch
yeah were talking about you bch
i a lot of its probably new vocabulary when we talk about it other than colors
colors well talk about -um
but a lot of it would be new new words
what are you doing bch
is there anything else that we didnt talk about that you played with today
-um i dont think so
no bch
no bch
no because we tried to play with the books but she didnt
i i mean i thought that the stuffed animals were gonna catch her attention more
just the colors and just
but they caught my attention
i like them
what do you think bch
no bch
okay bch
-um like i said the doll
made me think im gonna have to go get the doll from downstairs and let her play with it a little bit more
oh youre so happy now bch
yeah bch
so much better bch
well i think that thats it for today then
haha -um so just in terms of the things that he did play with here what do you think interested him the most
its hard to tell because he seemed to
its hard to tell
i think anything he can put in his mouth really
thats really what he cares about
-um you know once he saw this he recognized it each time it showed up so
he seemed to like that
he likes bright things
you know so he was going towards the bright animals
but i dont know that he had a favorite
i think itd be easy to substitute
aha so you think maybe the things that he could put in his mouth
the animals he didnt so much put in his mouth
but the things that he could hold
i mean but he liked this a lot
i took this away i guess
look at that
oh maybe not
he didnt really put it in his mouth right
no okay
well i dont know
i actually wasnt watching you too much
he put it in his mouth a little bit
so do you think thats why he liked it too or the color
or what do you think
well just based on the other things he likes he definitely likes the bright colors
-um and able to put it in his mouth
so it had two features huh
haha two reasons to love that one
yeah i see that you do
but then if i give him this again he might just take this again
ah hm do you have toys like any of these things at home
-um nothing like this box at all
-um we have lots of stuffed animals -um rattles things that you pull and they vibrate stuff like that
so i have a basket thats about this size
and what ill do is sit him on the floor and put the basket in front of him
and hell just pull stuff out and put it back in
but i dont play with him
i let him do that
-um but if i play with him normally what i would do is i do pattycake and this little piggy
and ill tickle him and
blow on his belly
thats the stuff what we do a lot more of
right not so much toys per se
not so much toys
but more stuff like that
or reading or something like that
-um i didnt see did you take a look at any of those books that we have
i pulled the foot book out for a moment
and started it
but he didnt have any interest
is that something you have at home that one
no i have the good night moon at home
but we have a couple doctor seuss in you know this size
cool -um do you think he prefers books or toys or
toys definitely to books yeah
because i try and introduce books a lot
and he doesnt seem to like them as much as i do haha
maybe by next time
you never know how things will change
-um i think you already said he doesnt play with pretend food and
no we dont have anything like this
-um the most hell do is when i put him in his highchair i give him plastic bowls and cups
and so he plays with those
he bashes them and throws them
haha he throws them
do you do that
throws them and likes to make noise
yeah definitely
i heard you make a noise
i heard you make a noise
its fun isnt it
yeah you cant do a lot with your voice
do you have any dolls baby dolls or anything dolllike besides the stuffed animal type toys
its like teddy bear and a monkey things like that
you have a monkey
thats his favorite
thats his favorite
its green and blue
and it has these hooks on the end on each of its limbs
and so it hooks onto everything
and hell just play with that forever
you mean you can put it onto like a chair
aha its like a sea thing
i have never seen that
does it have like a
is it a plastic hook
so its a furry animal and then just its appendages are
so you can hang it
so it looks like its hanging from a tree or something
aha its real cute
he likes that a lot
what do you got there
-um lets see
im not sure this applies at this particular age
but were there any items that you think he didnt really know the name of
-um well probably he probably doesnt know the name of a lot of them
thats what i would sort of think
you know -um
he doesnt
i mean i dont think yeah
i dont think he knows the name of a lot of the stuff
pertain more to the kids as they get older
i thought id ask lets see
and you said that he likes things that are bright colors and likes things that he can put in his mouth
aha haha thats usually what ends up with the books
so thats why we dont do books as much because he just puts them in his mouth
and theyre made out of paper
-um is there oopsies
did you go down
do you wanna get up
there you go
oops there you go
-um was there anything about how he likes to play that youve seen at home or here that youd -um
there you are
that i didnt ask that would be good to know
what he likes how he plays that kind of stuff
i mean i think the biggest thing is if hes ever by himself its definitely he likes different things
hell get bored
and hell go onto the next thing and go back again
-um ah i think thats
does he like playing by himself
he likes yeah i mean i work parttime and -um some of the days from home
and my babysitter didnt come on wednesday
so i had him for the day while i was working
and i put him on the floor with a blanket
and he just played for a good hour
actually which i was impressed with haha
but he really is more of a
actually let me modify that
he does play with himself
but he would prefer to interact with people by far
but hes not gonna fuss every time hes by himself
no yeah
wow thats pretty good alexander
thats pretty good
okay well i think
unless theres anything that you thought of that i didnt ask about what he likes
well -um revisit it when you come back again
okay and i guess thats all i have to do i can turn this off
-uh now i just wanna go over a couple questions
oh okay
im not gonna be writing down any answers so -uh
thats fine
because you know you have the mic on and that kind of stuff so
ah not in your mouth
i was just wondering -um which of the toys you thought that raina liked the most
the spoon
the spoon or i do not know
between the spoon and the keys
but shes determined to have the spoon how about i put it over there
all gone
its all gone
do you have similar toys at home
we have a baby doll
we have the books and we have the keys
we usually dont play with the spoon except when its time to eat but we do have that at home too
one that she bangs on
you cant have that
not the microphone
i didnt notice if you picked up any books
we had this one and this one
we have some like this at home
does she like those at home
you know obviously
she usually bangs the pages
in the flip book which is what she was trying to do here
then she put it down and saw the baby doll
so do you think she like books more or toys more
-um i dont know
i dont know that she has a preference
whatever is closest to her in her line of sight is what she wants
-um do you play with pretend food at home
-um no we dont
no you dont have any of those
-um but dolls
yeah she has a doll
i have a three year old niece so they each have to have their own doll because she has a baby and she wants the baby so
its a little baby for her
so she knew what the baby was
-uh do you think raina recognize any foods
i know that you were presenting her with some foods
i dont think so
say i have eaten any of that stuff yet
and do you think she recognize any animals
the names of any animals
which names do you think out of everything that you played with that she did recognize whether it be the specific names
oh i dont know
we have a book similar to this with the ducks on it which is why i pulled out the duck book
and we have a bee book at home and so i pulled out the bee to play
we have a book about that at home so
those are the ones that i pulled out just because
we read about those
see like she wants that one because we have one like that at home
the farm book
do you
oh sorry
no go ahead
do you play
you do
i thought she might like the book
she wants to close the pages
thats what she does at home
i have an and you lift up the flap and theres a picture of the baby on the inside
we open the flap peekaboo
but she didnt play
she just closed the book she wants to hold it
well she wants eat them all
and i guess the last question i noticed when we came in you said you have this clock at home but you didnt
no we didnt play well because we have it at home so
i was like oh they have other lets play with all the other stuff they have
yeah we dont have this book or that
thats funny
we have something similar but not the same
okay well great i think thats pretty much it unless you wanted to comment
do you have any questions about anything
it was fairly enjoyable
like she seems malleable enough
were good
yeah i just have a few questions to ask you actually
but he can keep playing
oh okay well for him right now playing is just putting everything in his mouth
thats how hes learning
and those two teeth coming through the bottom everything
so just which toys do you think were the most interesting for him to play with
and which ones do you think fit his personality the best
i mean toys that hes really into right now are block toys that if i build up he can knock them down which is why i started stacking the cans
but otherwise its stuff thats he can hold easily and put in his mouth
so i mean what he went for once i put them out were these cookies which are really wet and disgusting and the peas
oh youre giving them to me thank you
and i think he automatically recognized books because we read books a lot but
-um he doesnt play with plush animals very much because everything is going in his mouth
those you think would interest him the least out of all the toys we have here
would interest him the least
its probably the stuffed an or the big baby doll
he wouldnt know what to do with the big baby doll
we havent played with them at all
okay so do you guys have pretend food at home
no we dont ha
i mean because hes not really doing pretend play yet
so most of his toys are more sensory right now
so things that he can touch and eat and make noise and things like that
so no he doesnt have any pretend food
so what types of toys do you guys play with at home besides
you said you have sensory
-uh well he has -um blocks
he has a piano that he pats and it makes noise
he -um has like some shape sorters that have like different holes and that he can take things out and put them in
look at you rolling
he has like a sound like entertainment board thing
so mostly things like that
oh he can roll over
hes not crawling yet though
do you think that he recognizes any of the types of food that you would have here
-um no i mean his food is all mush
-um and we dont necessarily really eat in front of him because we eat after him
so would he recognize the food
not really
he recognized the spoons i think though
those he recognized
yes you do have big teeth coming in
judy did you have any questions
well just i dont know i saw you playing some little thing
do you have any like routine kinds of play peekaboo or any of those
one of the things weve been doing a lot lately
-um for christmas he just got -um these kind of squishy stacking blocks
so i stack up the blocks
and i count them up
and then he knocks them over
and then usually hes chewing on one at the time
and hell use the one that he has in his hand to knock it over
he does play peekaboo
he likes it best when we cover his head
and he pulls the cloth off
and then we all cheer
mhm so the one two three that was part of the like stacking
yeah thats what we do mhm
thats a fun game
thats a fun game
hes just figured out that he can roll to get places
so hes been doing that a lot lately
youre sharing with me huh
he just started flipping on the changing table too
haha which is not very fun
thats not a good idea
so i think thats all
easy enough
i would probably -um get rid of that
so which of the toys did he seem to be the most interested in
-um the peas
-um why do you think that is
he tried to put it in his mouth
if you have to pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you pick
good for his personality
and why
well -uh
i mean
i dont know
thats thats an interesting question
i didnt really think about it
id say hes least interested in the book
although with my first son he would love to be read to at this age
and he will a little bit
like he tolerated a few pages but
so thats the least like him
i -um
-uh i think he liked making sound from the plastic pieces by tapping them together
so i think that was something he could do something with
you know because the book and the animal theyre kind of they dont really do anything
so thats why i think he he was like wanting to do something
-um which of the toys did he seem to be the least interested in and why
-uh i think the book or the zebra
just because like you said they dont make
they dont make a sound or they dont theyre kind of you know theyre there
i dont know if he understands that me reading the book is
do you know what i mean
like if thats what im doing
i dont know if he gets that
do you think does he have a certain type of book that he prefers for you to read
i mean because we have we have that one at home for example
and we have something similar
we have a lot of of baby books like board books
he just doesnt seem that into it at this point
-um do you think theres any of these items that he recognizes the name for
i kind of doubt it
although we ha
maybe book
but i i dont know
i kinda
i dont know
thats a good question
what about some of the eating utensils
-um the spoon he might
but thats not the kind of spoon that he hes fed with
-um we do have play dishes at home
-um he mi
im trying to look at the animals
he might recognize an animal name
but -um -uh maybe not with those animals because theyre kinda specific
maybe frog
i dont know
-um do you have any of these toys at home
you mentioned the book
we have books
we have play dishes
i havent usually let him play with the play dishes per se
but he plays with things that are like -um similar
he ha
and right now hes cutting teeth
so like
things that he can chew on i think he prefers just now beca
-um but -uh he he he has a little keyboard that he likes to play
he has -um -uh you know sort of those those -um -uh
i dont know what you call them
like theyre like cloth teethers that have the sort of
like the the legs and stuff on them have like a plastic piece or a rattle piece or whatever
so theres he has different ones of those that he likes
does he ever play with dolls
-um i dont think we have a doll
we ha -um
we have like the soft blocks
and we have the big fat you know like the duplo type blocks
and -um we have stuffed animals and things like that
but im trying to think if he actually has a doll
i dont think he actually has a a quote unquote like baby doll
i dont think he has one at this point
okay i think we are done for today
oh i was gonna say its not a bias thing in the sense of
oh no
you know
i would let him play with a doll if he shows an interest in it
i dont care about that
-um so tell me about how you guys played and what you played with
what we played with
it looked like she gravitated to the food items and i think because of the colors
she really likes the colors
and maybe the soft texture of it
but it was hard enough to bite on it because shes teething so
she kept going after these little slices of pizza she liked that a lot
-um i kept trying to introduce her to the different stuffed toys
she wasnt interested at first
she hadta do that first
and then after a while she was kind of okay with the bumblebee
and she liked him because he was having interaction with her and kissing her and bumping up against her
and we do that a lot at home with stuffed toys
and we read a lot but she likes to eat the pages so
she got frustrated with me
because she wasnt able to eat the page
and that you saw she was getting a little fussy because of that
but normally we do
we sing the abc song like all day long
so shes familiar with that when she hears it
she hops her head up
and sometimes she plays in her -uh play pen at home
and i just throw a bunch of things in there and she just kinda plays with them independently
so shes not useta me playing like this much with her this long
because i think i im irritating her a little bit
shed rather just do her own thing
thats kinda her personality
are any of the food items familiar -um things from home
they have play food at home its not these items specifically
but she doesnt really play with those because theyre in our play room and shes too small to really go in there so she may have seen them before though
but theyre not the same stuff
theyre a little harder
theyre more like this
the plastic one
theyre thicker
do you use some of the names at home
-um the names of the food at home
pizza mhm
shes probably heard us talking about pizza night or whatever because she has a brother that loves pizza
-uh that goes to mommys bch
you have all these toys and you want the microphone bch
-um i mean shes not really eating a lot of things yet but shes probably heard us talking t about them and then im saying them as were playing like spaghetti and icecream
-um what about is she starting to use like -um forks and spoons
no shes eating with her fingers shes eating finger foods a lot
she eats like cheerios and fruit puffs and stuff like that
but shes watched this show on tv with her siblings
the word word word world i think its called
so this is probably looks a little familiar with her
does she know that the animal names
some of them or would they be familiar with to her
i mean im sure shes heard it before on the shows
any of the other animals she might be familiar with
so shes probably heard dog before
-um bumblebee
thats why i grabbed these two
mostly because of their color but shes shes seen those before
-um shes familiar with winnie the pooh
and she knows about hello kitty
because her entire bedroom is decorated that way
shes never seen it in yellow though
she might not totally know that thats hello kitty yet
aha bch
aha sweetie pie bch
and then i heard you were playing with the food kind of like imaginary play
-um is that something that you do at home
i do that with everything
with her at home
-um and everything i typically if i have her on my hip when were walking around the house and doing different things im naming everything im picking up
so she starts to get familiar with spoon
when i was holding the spoon i kept saying it
and the daughter thats two actually was talking at twelve months very very fluently
like you could understand everything and she was really clear
and its probably because i did that with her
shes kinda saying some things already
this one
thats exciting
so shell probably be that way as well
kennipoo i cant have you put it in your mouth and go fer far back in your mouth because youre gonna choke sweet pea bch
how did you decide -um what to use for the imaginary play like the objects
i was watching her
you know just seeing what she kept gravica gravitating to
she wanted the food
i kept introducing the books and shes like not right now
and i tried to bring a t stuffed toy and she would like not really pay much attention to it
now shes a little more open i think
shes bored with the food i think
so now shes looking at the other stuff
but i was following her lead
which food items were her favorite
i think the pizza
-um she picked up the spaghetti a little bit
and then the icecream cone
and she gnawed on it
i hope these are clean
yeah we actually clean them -um after every visit
and she liked the cookie
probably because of the colors
and it was easy to pick it up
were you -um bringing in other names for what they could be
certain things
just kind of like
i called them what they are
yeah okay
i want her to learn it the right way
i told her that these were both spaghetti even though im not sure if they are
one looks totally different than the other one but
kennedy honey thats you keep going after and you cant have that bch
thats gonna get jabbed in your throat bch
how about the books
which ones did you
i was trying to show her this yellow one because she likes yellow she tends to gravitate to the color yellow s because its nice and bright and cheerful i think
and she touched the little fur for a second
but shes her attention span when reading is not quite there
so we can get through a couple of pages but she really just wants to eat it
and and play with the pages
so thats usually what i let her do with books
but i read every night to the other ones and shes usually sitting right there
sometimes shes really attentive to it
shes actually listening
at least it looks like it
do you have any of the same books at home
-um i have a lot of doctor seuss books i dont have that one though
the foot book looks familiar
and i have a book very similar to this one on the farm
its not quite this one but its very similar to this
and its got the thick pages like that
this is the first time ive seen the peekaboo book thats cute
but she would rip this one
because its not really thick
how did she do with it today
she did fine i got through it but she kept trying to you know eat the pages
was there a page that she maybe you thought or she did think was particularly exciting
she liked this curtain page
and maybe because it split in two and she could grab it easier
this one
she didnt really care what was under it she was more or less con interested
aha im sorry honey bch
she was more or less concerned about the actual
hey sweetie bch
are you enjoying yourself bch
huh bch
are you enjoying yourself bch
what you think baby girl bch
youre probably getting a little hungry huh bch
you call her a couple different names right
i mean just like nick names sweet names
you know its just natural i dont even know what im calling her half the time
sweet pea honey
mostly kennipoo
dont you bch
you think thats your name dont you bch
you think kennipoos your name bch
i did not even pick up the babydoll
i thought she might be afraid of it its kinda big
i didnt even see this one actually
yeah this is as big as you bch
you like it bch
you think its another baby bch
yeah bch
you like to pull hair there you go bch
yeah bch
you say why is she letting me do this bch
yeah thats a very fun thing that shes just letting you do everything you wanna do bch
you like her hair bch
yeah you like her eyes arent they pretty bch
does she have pretty eyelashes bch
oh you god bless you bch
you sneezed in the babys face bch
say excuse me bch
excuse me bch
so if you hadta pick -um like her favorite thing today -uh to play with what do you think it wa
or things it doesnt necessarily have to be one but
she seems very interested in this one
maybe i should have pulled out the babydoll sooner
she liked that bumblebee
yeah she seemed to have a lot of reaction to it once she finally decided she was going to be okay with stuffed toys
but she liked the
kennedy okay honey youre pulling her hair out bch
look at you took the babys hair out bch
kennipoo bch
you took her hair out bch
oh its okay bch
shes alright honey bch
its alright bch
its okay bch
you wanna still play with her bch
so you held the bee and you were pretend playing with the bee like the bee was kissing her
thats not mommys bch
you have hair all over the place little one bch
poor little babydoll bch
i think she bit his nose
she tried to kiss him or whatever she does with him
she has this thing with faces
whats wrong youre getting hungry bch
youre getting hungry bch
-um what would you say was her least favorite thing
her least favorite thing
probably these toys words
these -um she wasnt interested in pooh today which was surprising
she didnt want that
she was really not really all that interested in the books
other than wanting to bite them
yeah bch
what do you wanna play with bch
does she have like a favorite color
she likes yellow
she definitely likes yellow
and that seems to be what shes gravitated to even today
yeah bch
are there any colors that you find that she doesnt gravitate toward
her least favorite
-um i do not know i never really paid attention to that
-um okay i think thats it for today
got plenty to be interested in
well toys that we have here and the things we have here
what would you say interested her the most
the play food
the play food
by far
and do you think there is anything about her her personality
how she is that -um that accounts for that or
not particularly
i think potentially it could be its
well i was gonna say browns not all that colorful
but its -um a kind of toy shes never seen before
we dont have any
-um where as we have stuffed toys we have books
so this stuff she hasnt you dont have at home and the dishes the food any of that stuff you dont have at home
thats definitely novel
got it
that is really interesting
and so
what do you think out of these things interested her the least
at least today
the books
today the books
says it now been there done that ha
she has a lot of books at home
we do lots of reading and
and her dad has now taught her how to open books and
turn pages by herself when youre reading to her or
-um shes not quite there yet
but -um
she does instead of just going whack with the books now
you know the ones that she knows
shell open
kind of smile at
and sort of shake and flip open to another page
and smile at
so shes
but shes not you know doing the pages as we read yet
shes kind of choosing the pace a little bit
and of these here
do you have any at home that are ones she might recognize from home
as far as exactly the same no
i actually grabbed this book because we have a similar
like the same brand that has the you know ducks and
but -um not the exact book
haha cookie
you know what a cookie is already dont you
courtesy of daddy and mommy sorry
how about any of the other things
would she recognize -uh any of the things shes seen here
does she have stuffed animals like any of these
she actually has a little duck thats almost similar characters
like colors as the frog
and same size
and she has a lot of little clothes and stuff with frogs
and theres the baby doll
you discovered the baby doll
you have about just as much hair as that
just looking around
oh oddly enough these are like the best toy ever
on the -um
and okay she would recognize that
yup she recognizes these
spoons cups
would she recognize any of the food items do you think
-um shes actually had little bits of bread
when pierce and i have had bread
-um shed probably recognize a hamburger
because we do cookout relatively frequently
pizza a lot if we are ordering in
i dont think shes actually seen us eat spaghetti
but the pretty red and white
and you were saying she doesnt eat peas like that
oh no she eatsum eats the mushy peas
but she loves peas
any like green
actually shes a big green veggie fan
which i hear is not normal for babies
going with the fact that she loves spinach
she does
-um lets see
so she likes to play with the -um measuring spoon type stuff and things like
the plastic baby food containers
she actually really likes balls
squishy balls
since she likes you know well make stuff bounce
and just some stuff go crash
-um she like to do that
weve lately started playing with stacking cups
and shes learned about knocking things over
but those are sort of the preferred toy right now
are the stacking cups
-um and remote controls
cause a lot of times we have parents mention toys that are favorites at home
like balls
blocks or things
its like the balls and the stacking cups right now
along with you know anything
pretty much anything that we touch
is what she wants
-um so
the telephone she actually has a little hissy fit
-um whenever i pick up the phone i dont put it on speaker phone
she knows now that its a conversation
or that mommy starts talking when she picks it up
and knows that its not at her
and you want wires
and ice cream
shes seen ice cream
i dont think so
but yeah
shes definitely into the like picking out the most dangerous thing in the room stage right now
and how about you said she has a lot of things with frogs on them
does she know the names of any animals
do you think or
she heard
she probably knows like frog duck and cat
she definitely knows cats
and or specific cats names
do you have cats at home
but she definitely
definitely knows the word cat
oh aoife yucks
yeah thats really gross
im sorry
oh its fine
here baby
here let us do your face first
cause that cant feel very good
there you go
and then dress
good enough
and did she have any baby dolls at home
-um just like one little squishy one
what she interested in that at all
no more than any other stuffed toy
cause just here
at the end
she seemed a little bit interested in that dolls face
was one of those things
making me think that maybe we should pick up a baby doll
put it on the christmas list
its coming soon
i know
so she doesnt play with that so much
how much does she play with stuffed animals at home
not that frequently
they are more of like a crib
like when she wakes up in the morning
she has one that she likes to whack and choke -um
mostly around the crib
or if im taking a shower
ill plop her on the floor or do stuffed toys
actually thats stuffed toy and book time
so thats when she would
yeah but if theres other things around
shell usually pick up
she has this one little chicken that she likes
do we have one
yeah but like color wise you know
with the chicken its color wise about the same
-um but with the chicken she -um
you know pick him up shake him and set him down
-um pet him a little bit and thats it
like shes definitely more interested in the cups and
things like that
little harder things
things that like honestly shes in a whacking phase right now
-um so anything that she can whack
-um and shes already starting to pick up like what makes good noise you know
to her good noises and a little more satisfying whack
that sounds about right
well thats all the questions i have
and if i didnt ask you anything about what she likes and doesnt
like and how she likes to play
-um you can go ahead and let me know that
we will probably ask you very similar questions the next time
and to see how she plays then
just trying to think
aoife anything
usually mommys a lot noisier
thats what a lot of parents this age
we do lots of
yup love noise and lots of singing
singing okay
loves to sing
or loves to hear me sing and shell actually sort of sing along
i didnt think you needed that on
for my voice anyway on -uh
you do itsy-bitsy spider huh aoife
oh fun
rubber ducky
maybe next time shell wanna do
yeah well do some songs
alright thats great
he loves feet
loves feet
loves shoes
you actually can keep that on
i just have a few questions for you
oh sure
you dont wanna eat my shoe
yes he does
gonna give you some
wanna hold the pizza
can you hold that
good boy
i just have a few questions for you
-um so which of the toys -um was he most interested in would you say
the fake pizza
why do you think that
his sister have a lot of ah fake food at home
she has a little kitchen set
and the food is in a bin on the floor
and hes able to crawl to it and knock the bin over
and get the food out of it
so he plays with similar stuff at home
okay -um which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
the stuffed animals
yeah doesnt really care for them
just no interest
they dont do anything
they dont taste all that good
okay would you say he prefers books over toys
or toys over books
he prefers toys over books
okay and if you hadta pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you pick and why
-um for his personality
like in general or what you have here
from what we have here
-um i guess the pizza because he likes it so much
hes in a stage where hes
well obviously sticking everything in his mouth
and its squishy
and its the right size for his hands
and its colorful
and i guess the plastic doesnt taste bad
do you think he recognizes the names for any of these items
-um he might
he might recognize baby because theres a baby doll at home we play with
and -um
what about the food
i dont know
i dont think he knows the specific names
but i try and as hes interacting with things tell him what things are
okay and lets see what else we have
do you have any of these exact same toys at home or books or any
-um the fake pasta looks like stuff we have at home
and the icecream cone and the peas
probably got them out of the same type of set
we have mister brown can moo
but i dont know if ive ever read it to him
-um and we dont have any of the stuffed animals
okay and then i guess you said he was recognizing
yeah well hes got a bottle
so he was picking it up and kind of trying to suck on it the same way he does with his bottle
and you know we have fake plates
we have s fake pizza
but its harder plastic
okay i think thats all we have for you today
leave it
-um which toys did she seem to be interested in
the hard ones
oh the foods
-um do you have any of these pretend foods at home or
-um what about the which ones of these was she least interested in
the books
-um do you guys have any of the books at home or
we dont have any of these particular books
we do have books
alright -um
does she have any of -um does she have pretend dolls at home or stuffed animals
yeah we got a few of those
do you think shed recognize any of the -um foods we have
not yet
nah shes only eating purees right now
-um how about the animals is there anything she recognized
she mightve recognized pooh but other than that
-um so at home would you say she prefers books or toys
she chews on books occasionally but
-um okay i think that would be it unless theres anything you wanna tell me about how she plays at home or if she has other toys
not really right now
pretty much anything she can get her mouth on shes fond of
is it okay if i ask you some questions
-um what do you think -uh miles liked the most today
anything that he could chew on
that was more firm
as opposed to the stuffed animals
i imagine because hes teething
what were some of those
like the food
like the waffle
the waffle was a big hit
the plates
the spoon
he enjoyed the books some too
do you read books at home
well i try
after a couple pages he usually takes them away and tries to chew on them
how about -uh do you have any of the same books at home or any similar themes
-uh i dont think we have any of these
we have one similar to this animal one
it has you know touch and feel
is he getting familiar with like -uh animal names
i dont know at this point if hes made that connection yet
its hard to tell
does he have any similar -um toys with the stuffed animals
-um he does have stuffed animals
hes got a winnie the pooh about this size
but most of his stuffed animals are bigger
his size
-uh not quite that big
kind of standard teddy bear size
did you two play with the doll at all today
i showed it to him and he wasnt interested and went back to chewing on the waffle
does he have any dolls at home
i dont think he has any
i dont think so
what kinda toys does he have at home
like how does he like to usually play or do you usually like to play together
-um types of toys he has at home
i mean he has story books and he has some stuffed animals
hes not typically as interested in those
hes got like a little ball with a jingle bell inside it and he likes
anything he can kind of chew on he likes
and hes got a toy phone that makes sound and talks to him
he likes that
but usually hes trying to get the remote control or our cellphones
so weve given him an old cellphone and things like that
and if were playing together we may not be playing with a toy per se but doing like you know the airplane game or
more physical type things
do you think any of the
oops im sorry
youre okay
food names -um of the foods that are here are familiar
like things that you eat at home that hes heard the name of
-um peas
hes had peas
-um he might have heard pizza
probably not waffles
that would
cheese i guess but he didnt play with the cheese
does he play with keys at home
with keys
-uh i mean hes got a
some toy keys
toy keyring type thing
not real ones
hed probably like to but we dont want them lost so
yeah good call
or hed stab himself in the eye or something
do you think the way he played today is like the way he plays at home
yeah i think so
do you usually have like the toys all spread around or
i was gonna say not nearly this many toys out at one time
i mean in some ways its similar to how he plays at home but often at home hell play with a toy for a little bit and then hell crawl over and pull up on the couch or
i mean hes very into
there arent this many toys around
hes very into seeing what he can find next and things to pull up on
try to reach and grab
oh you like that
yeah its a baby like you
kind of
you gonna eat her head now
or his
i cant tell
the gender of the doll but
its neutral i think
the babys head
does he like things that make music
-um like out of like you know sound texture and color what do you think hes most attracted to
mostly probably to texture at this point because hes really into chewing everything
-um but he does yeah he does like things that play music or sounds
thats why he likes like ive said the toy telephone that hes got
you push buttons and winnie the pooh talks to you and stuff
he likes that
and he likes whatever we have of course
youd mentioned that with books its only about like two or three pages in
are there any books that hes more interested in than others
-um im not sure if hes more interested in some than others
when you first open a book he usually gets really excited
you know he likes to see the pictures
i mean i guess most of the books hes looked at have animals in them
hes excited at first but then he remembers that he wants to chew on it
like out of the books here which books had you chosen to kind of play with him
-um im not sure if i
i dont remember now if he grabbed either one of these or if i grabbed
i think he grabbed this one
like i said this is similar to what we have at home
and this one i may have grabbed just because its dr seuss
i like dr seuss
i thought he probably would too
the like rhyming words
and the pictures are pretty
theyre pretty attractive to a baby i would think
bright colors and happy creatures
do you say things like body parts to him
like this is your foot or feet or eyes or nose or any of that at this point
i guess we do
i mean its something i havent explicity thought of
to some degree yes
not you know going through them all ritualistically or anything
i just meant since thats the foot book so i thought maybe like
right yeah
we point out things like that to some degree
do you have pets at home
we dont
i mean hes been around
his grandparents have pets
so hes been around dogs and cats when weve visited
but i dont know if he can categorize whats a dog yet or anything
mhm yeah
well i mean i often ask like what would be like familiar to them like horsie piggy something like that because at this age
most kids havent seen a lot of horses and
right so i just kind of think well is it familiar as in have they heard of it
is there a book on horsies that you read or something like that you know
yeah i guess we do have a couple different barnyard type animal books
it seems to be a popular theme for baby books
where you going
hes swimming on the toys
that one wasnt squishy enough
thats funny
is there anything else about the session that -um you thought was like particularly a lot like him or not at all like him
nothing in particular
i mean for playing with toys its pretty typical of what he would do
just he often would you know be off in some other direction too
i think thats probably just because there are so many toys and theyre all new to him so
i do try to switch out the toys that he has out every week or so that it keeps it more interesting for him
thats good
do you kind of like change the theme of the toys too
i mean its nothing that scientific about it
just put a couple back in the toybox
take a couple different ones out
alright well i think thats it for today
what do you want
about enough of
her torture
oh come on talk to me for just a minute
youre just about done arent you
wheres your pacy
oh yeah i know you see that
youre one of those you notice electronics
what are we gonna do when youre eleven months
and much more active
maybe youre as active as youre gonna be
lets hope
shes all over
oh boy
yeah well -um
i guess i want first of all your impressions of what you thought most interested her out of these kinds of toys here
probably the books
and i think it was more to put them in her mouth
she obviously excuse you
didnt want -um
want me to hold it for you
be better
i think it will still pick up your voice
she didnt wanna read them she just wanted to eat them
eat them was there anything in particular that she wanted to eat from these books
she likes
she likes
the corners of books
i dont know why
any particular book you think
no i dont think so
does she have any books like this at home
so do you think that she would like that she recognizes any of these as familiar to her
well we have the hard book type
oh okay
that she usually has on the floor with her
and she chews on the corners
so you found the books books were the most interesting for her today
-um and what did you think about the least interesting
-um i think probably the baby because shes -uh dissuaded from playing with the baby at home
ah got it
theyre kind of off limits
yes they are
even her own
oh now you see it
wanna go for it
and what did what do you think about -um the stuffed animals
go for it
how did she
well look at you
she kind of hadta find it on her own she had no interest in anything i gave her
which is fine with me
so did she find anything in particular that she liked out of the stuffed animals
definitely the bee
do you think thats why she liked it
i think so
the bee had different textures to it
and how about the food and dishes types of toys
any interest in those
didnt really have not really
shes pretty young but do you think theyre any of those items that she would recognize the names of
some of this stuff
like tacos and bottle and
i mean you got it right there
you said soup
is she eating any finger foods
not yet
oh okay
she tries
so -uh when she comes back for her next visit soon well see if that changes
that will be interesting
you said theres babies at home
any of these other kinds of toys at home
she has books hard books
yeah -uh stuffed animals we have a lot of but not really where they play
does she have one that shes attached to at all
we have this one at home or at my parents house actually
that bee
i dont think shes ever played with it she was too young when they got it
she likes the sticky hair but its not because she recognizes it
unless she has an incredible memory
-um is there anything else i needta
is there anything that you find that she really enjoys playing with or exploring at home that we dont have here
things that make noise the keys kind of do but like a lot of shakers and
some kids find the -um pitcher and put something in it and it makes a pretty loud noise
so she would probably like something like that
things that give instant gratification
like the feeling of the bee
so very sensory
you like that
she didnt really play with anything that was very loud this time well see what happens
next time if shes still interested in
making noise
well except for this
except for this bee so that was
you said the books and then maybe the bee
were the things okay
mhm definitely
and -um
im assuming shes putting things in her mouth at this stage
everything okay
so that would be how she
interact with most things probably
mhm yeah
dont let that
heres your pacy
yeah we keep the pacifier in her mouth because shes extremely oral
everything goes in
and everything on the floor happens to be stuff she cant have
that must prevent a lot of frustration to have that pacy in
-um it does except shell spit it out and find what she cant have
do you do that
right when i cant be there to rescue it from her mouth
pretty smart
pretty smart at seven months old
well -um
i think thats all i needta ask you about what she likes to play with and how shes playing
and then when she comes back at her ten month or so visit well probably ask you very similar kinds of questions and -um see how it changes for her
but she seems like she might be about done
i think so youre done
you ready for a nap
good work
you can keep playing if you like
-um what do you think -uh she was most interested in today
i think anything she can chew
like the soft food toys
-um she liked and she does like stuffed animals
so those two things i think would be
is that similar to how she plays at home
because shes teething right now so anything that she can put in her mouth
you agree
-uh do you have the pretend food at home
i dont have the pretend fru food yet but obviously well be getting some
do you play with the stuffed animals at home
yeah she has a lot of stuffed animals and we have a bunch of poohbears which is why i thought shed go for this but -um yeah we have a ton of stuffed animals and she always goes for them
which animals does she have at home
shes got -um a lot of those -um
the brand is the lamaze toys
do you think she recognized the names of any of the the stuffed animals she played with today
i dont think so
no i dont think so
at home one toy we do have is a balloon and thats the one thing she will recognize if you say balloon she will turn in the house and look for it
thats the one she knows
the peas
that one i think she knows because that was her first food
and thats the one she
you would eat all the time we even bought a book about peas
for her and wed always just say peas please
would you like some peas please
so that one i thought maybe she might
any other foods that she played with that you thought
that she would know the names or
-um i dont think so you know
because we havent really
havent really introduced her to -um she still like eats baby food and formula so
but she has had icecream
how about the books
did you
did she
she has the regular good night moon book at home -um and we read her all the doctor seuss books so
that one but yeah this one
i dont think she recognizes or them but we do read her
to her
does she like to play with books more than toys or toys more than books
well right now with the books its more like especially the board books she puts it right in her mouth so it probably doesnt matter what as long as she can put it in her mouth
but she does enjoy the
but she does at nighttime -um my husband sits in a chair with her and they read
and shell just sit you know right before she goes to bed
thats nice
yeah thats their little thing
do you think today -uh here she showed more interest in the toys or the books
i think today was more into the toys
and at home with
you are so much happier here than the first part
good way to end on this
-um so at home what does she what does she usually play with like her favorite toys at home
-um we have tons of teething stuff around the house
-um and any toy that like
well she liked this bee by the way too because of his -um hair
but anything that she can -um the toys we have all like and -um
anything with lights
and noises she has a huge doggie -um stuffed toy that has like you know every time you press something it says oh this is his foot and sings a song
so she likes anything with lights and noise
thats cute
i know i saw that you forgot about him huh
you like mister bee
does she have any dolls at home
she has -um
yeah she has but theyre like soft dolls
nothing like this but
just like the you know theyll be like this but a doll looking
and do you call it a doll
i do
i say its her babydoll
does she just -uh play with it like the way she plays with other stuffed animals
exactly the same
yeah she is liking that
yeah i know
before i pulled it away and she had like one piece that she was just holding in her mouth
and the spoon huh
the balloon and her name are like the two things that we just kind of recognized ourselves
that she knew like
like if you said the balloon or say her name she would turn
in the direction of you know us or the balloon in the house
so those are the only two things that i know of
right now
would you like a spoon
what do you think she sorry liked the least
i dont know
i dont know
i mean she doesnt you know shes not attentive to listen to a book
long enough but i mean i dont
thats too bad were still doing that
-um i dont know i think she liked it all
she was very happy here
oh really
thats good
there wasnt anything that you tried to introduce that she was like -um this isnt happening for me right now
no i dont think so
you know like she definitely had a preference for like this stuffed animal versus this stuffed animal
you know but i think its because of his hair
she likes it see
well she picked up the -um
she picked up the other one the
she did pick up the frog she actually moved to get the frog
so he was back here and she did move to get him
why do you think that is
i dont know if the color
i dont know
she went right over the other one
ill just use you to
youre just gonna help me get to my frog
what is that
you got a little monster in you huh
you can go ahead and just keep playing
and then i have some questions i wanted to ask
sure oh okay absolutely
so what did you think interested her the most out of the toys that we have here
-uh this bumblebee for sure
and the spoon
likes that in particular
-uh i think the colors and -uh shes never
this is pretty stringy
i think the material
its different
yeah and she doesnt have anything like that at all
the texture probably feels different in her mouth
-uh huh
so she really likes that
what else does she like
the spoon this purple spoon
were gonna have to get some spoons out for you we dont have any spoons
is that her favorite one
this one yeah
this purple one and -um and then the keys
she likes the keys
but -uh i think this one
this one for sure
oh you got on your face
okay good
and so you said the texture with that do you think the other things as well
is that why she likes the spoons and keys and stuff the texture
no i think these are hard and i think it probably feels good on her her teeth
and it fits in her mouth pretty good
and its easy for her to wield it you know
she has a lot to see
-um okay good and how about what do you think interested her the least
the book
the books i think and maybe the other stuffed animals
most of hers have you know little squeaky things so it was kinda a little bit hard to get her attention
but thats all right
were you showing her some of those
yeah this one and the pink poodle and the goose and the zebra
im surprised she didnt pick up on this because usually the white and black grabs her attention
but -uh yeah
maybe that one
this was hard to compete with
that one was gone she wouldve liked that one better over there
okay so you think stuffed animals and the books
yeah i mean i didnt explore the doll with her and she doesnt really have any
she was really kind of focused over this area
-um so do you have for instance toys like the dishes and food at home
no we dont have dishes and food
-um she has lots of stuffed animals
she has lots of books
and no baby dolls
no baby doll no
and -um do you think out of any of the items here there are any that she would recognize the names of
or would she have heard before
well i was looking for a giraffe because i was wondering she has a chew toy thats a giraffe
-um just to see if she would recognize it
its kinda shaped the same
-um and i was wondering if she might pick up on the book
the term book
but she didnt really seem to pay any attention to it so
well see next time
she may be less interested in that next time
it interests me and i you know this is the one that i picked up first because it was different than anything shes seen
-um so i can try something different next time and see if she
aha see what she does
theres a lot of change that can happen between now and then
and i know she wasnt really interested in the books today but does she have books at home
are there ones that she likes better
-um she likes the well yeah i was kinda well shes sitting on it the one that has the feely
yeah -um but -uh shes got some other ones that just -um like theres a farm animal book that she likes
-um and then theres a numbers book that just has big pictures in it but i dont think you know i think she
theyre bigger too and so that she can they lay out in front of her and she can just kinda crawl on it and stuff
does she like oh sorry
those seem to capture
she tries
she tries
-uh i dont know she tends to get a little frustrated and then move on to the next thing
yeah because we actually have a bunch toys that are kinds scattered out and not sure if thats a good thing or not
because its easy distraction and then she doesnt you know tend to work on the one item
and actually she likes we have blocks
i dont see any blocks here
that was gonna be another question is are there toys that we dont have here
yeah she has some foam blocks and some wooden blocks
-um and then the -um stacking rings thing
and oh and in the waiting room you had the little the maize thing
she has one of those too and she actually does -um i dont know if that shes realized she can move them along the wire but she does like to grab onto it and spin them
okay so she likes blocks and the maize thing
what else did you say there was one more thing
oh the -uh stacking ring thing
yeah and she actually she likes anything that makes noise
so shes got a little key ring that makes noise and theres a couple other little toys like that if you press the right and oh what she really likes is her exersaucer
with all the other you know the spinning things with the the confetti type stuff in it and the mirrors and oh she has a mirror she really likes yeah
okay thats interesting to know
yeah it its a fish shaped like a fish so when you hit it makes you know like kinda of undersea bubble noises and then its got the mirror on it
-um shes liked that from very early on
and she still does
yeah she still does yeah
oh careful
did you put that a little too far back
i seriously doubt it
she had a ice cream cone
recognize ice cream
hard to tell right now
okay and i think i asked you everything i have here
-um oh so the things she likes the best is there a reason you think they might be good for her personality like the kind of infant she is or not necessarily
oh careful sweetheart
here you mean
-um because of her personality
-um i i its hard to say
i mean i think she picked up on this because it was different so thats you know shes generally pretty curious and wants to you know explore different things
-um yeah its hard to know if thats personality or
and at home what do you think
at home -um
-um i think well i mean if the exersaucer counts as a toy i mean i think she likes that because she can actually -um jump up and down and shes not like
she falls over at home sometimes and i think that limits a little bit how far shes willing to go at times especially if shes tired
-um i dont know thats a tough question
thats okay
-um she likes the little toys and i think mostly because she can easily grab them and put them in her mouth
and its hard here for her to be as active as she might at home so with the set up but just curious sometimes -um if theres differences based on activity level or
thats fine were probably gonna ask you the same questions next time
i didnt think personality i was thinking that she was just curious and so she you know she
she does move pretty good at home
-um so
okay well see how she changes
yeah okay
between now and then she may play differently
she may like different things so well have the same toys and well see how it goes
okay good
okay what do you think ava enjoyed the most
playing today
she liked the baby
she doesnt have a babydoll at home
she doesnt
she doesnt
so -um
that was new for her
she really likes books
she has a lot of books at home she loves to just turn the pages -um
see shes going after the baby again
and then she likes -um she liked this thing
like the fur
she has a couple things at home that have a little fur
she likes the baby
yeah and i guess the things that made noise like the keys and this thing
how would with regards to the baby what do you think that she liked about the baby
she does that when shes trying to show off and get your attention shell go sideways i dont know why
i think because its the same size at her
because she has a couple stuffed animals and shes more interested in the ones that are the bigger ones that are about her size
i think the face
like the eyes i think shes in tune with
and i dont know maybe this one
because it looks like her and i think because it makes noise
its head makes noise
its like a rattle but
maybe thats disgusting she likes to kiss it
its okay yeah we clean the toys its fine yeah
-um what do you think what were the kind of things that you were doing to kind of keep her engaged with the baby
just like made it talk to her
-um i sat it on my lap because i wasnt sure if she would like get jealous or not but
she didnt seem to care she came over and gave it a kiss so
thats nice
-uh yeah
i think maybe we should get her a babydoll
what do you think about the -um the books
do you have similar books at home
the books that are her favorite at home are the one that have -um the touchy feely things in them -um
she likes those the best
-um because she likes to run her hand down the page and try to figure out like where it is
and plus i think it makes them easier to turn
because theyre kinda halfway open so she can turn the pages really easy
-um so i think those are her favorite -um
i guess maybe the colors
you know she liked this one but not really the other ones so
what kind of textures do you think she likes the most
she likes the fur
i guess thats her fine motor skills working on that -um
yeah she likes the fur i think
and then this one doesnt have any
but at home we have ones that have like like bumps
or like -uh like velcro you know like the scratchy part of the velcro she loves those
yeah i dont know why i guess because its real easy for her to feel
so she likes those
and -um
were you playing -uh peek a boo or was that
i dont think so
she likes to play peek a boo and actually she -um shell play peek a boo with herself
so shell take a cover up over her head and then pull it off
and shell do it as long as youre if you keep saying wheres ava wheres ava
oh there she is
then shell do it
so yeah she likes peek a boo a lot
thats cute
one of her favorite games
and then this book happened to be -um about animals
do you think youve been over certain names of animals with her or
well we have a cat and she knows the word for cat like if i
normally if i say it
shell start like looking around and trying to find the cat
so -um
hey ava cat
no shes not here im sorry
but yeah so she really likes the cat
cat and parrot too
we have a stuffed parrot and she likes that
its a -um
so yeah she liked this puppet
and her parrot at home is a puppet
and so she likes that
i dont know because it reacts or something i dont know
and it tickles
were there any other stuffed animals that you played with
-um this one oh she played with this guy she liked this
yeah she likes that part
yeah she can pull it and
its kinda like sticky
and -um a couple of her animals have like little like theyre not sticky like this but -um
little strings for their tails
and shell sit there and just like pull on them you know keep her entertained for about five minutes which
in her day thats a long time so
do you think shed recognize the name for bee
no she only knows -um
i think like three words
maybe four she knows up
and she knows cat
and i think mama and kissy
i noticed you she was running over to the camera and so you were giving her -uh you know you said some no and she stopped
oh yeah she does know no
and then during the play you were saying good job and was wondering because i noticed she understood the no and i was just wondering
-um she does i think she understands praise for sure
-um because thats how we got her to like if we say give mommy kissy shell give you a kiss -um and then we made like such a big deal out of it
and so now she does it for the praise i think
right now were working on highfive and -uh
so shell do that
-um but i think she does know when youre like good job good job and she gets excited so
-um and what about any of the play food
did she
-um she
well she was interested in the spaghetti for some real she doesnt eat any finger foods at all she only has purees so
she doesnt know what any of it is
and she doesnt drink out of a juice cup either so i think was interesting because it moved but -um
she doesnt know what is
and then she played with the pizza but
i dont think shes ever seen pizza before
i think it was just the colors
the contrast on there
that makes sense
so and plus its kind of squishy
so theres not really anything that that you may have used the name of at home or something that shed be familiar with or even
mhm no
nope not even
n i mean she doesnt even drink a bottle so -um
so yeah she doesnt really
not yet
what do you think she was least interested in
-um probably the food
and then she didnt really pay attention to this that much
i dont expect her to know what a clock is
-um and i mean then particular stuffed animals i guess
like these arent necessarily as brightly colored so
she didnt really go for those and like
she didnt look at -um any of these books she has this book but she doesnt look at it
she didnt really play with any of this stuff
-um yeah
and now shes playing with the pizza again
and the spaghetti
so do you have -um stuffed animals at home
we have some
we have some stuffed animals
and she plays with those
like i said she plays with a lot of books
she spends the majority of her time on the floor
-um like
she doesnt go in her bouncer she doesnt go in a swing
i dont carry her in a sling
we have an exersaucer
she hates it
doesnt wanna be in it
so -um
she spends most of her time crawling around or -um
she can pull up on things and so she just likes to
you know crawl over to like couch and pull up on the couch and sometimes ill like spread toys out on the couch and she plays with them -um
and then she has a lot of little i dont know like fisher price like little activity things that shell play with
and those will keep her entertained but
yeah shes not really into all the automated kind of like swings and stuff so -um
she spends most of her time just kind of hanging out on the floor crawling around and chasing the cat and stuff so
sounds like she just likes to be free
she does
she doesnt like to be confined
-um she does like to go in her stroller thats the one thing -um
she likes to go on walks
she likes to be outside -um
so we try to spend at least an hour or two outside
just like walking around and looking at stuff so
if were inside -um all day
or we dont go anywhere that day she gets really like ornery
like she wants to go somewhere just
doesnt matter where like target the mall she doesnt care just doesnt wanna be home all the time so
well thats nice
thats nice youre social
-um well i guess i think i just had -uh one question about the stuffed animals because it seems like she tends to play with toys
and that seemed to be something she liked here today
because i feel like you played with a lot of stuffed animals
-um did you find in particular that she liked or did you feel that it was better to kind of go through them all
-um well we didnt go through them all
i mean we looked at this one because it has sparkles she likes things that are sparkly
she likes that guy
and then she liked this fur
its not my puppy
and on the first page is this book
actually we have the book with us and it looks just like this dog so
she played with that
and it looks just like it
he came right outta your book
she may recognize that
-um but yeah she likes stuffed animals and like i said -um our parrot is a puppet and she really likes that so we played with this
she -um has a really short attention span so
i mean im sure all babies do but she doesnt like concentrate on something for very long
so -um thats why we went through a lot of them
a lot of toys keeping her happy
do you feel like she played similarly here as she does at home
-um i think she wasnt frustrated here because sometimes at home i think she gets bored or frustrated with like the same toys so -um
these were newer so i think they held enter her attention span longer
which is good
well good
well im glad that she enjoyed herself
because we have a couple more visits just like this okay
and we dont have carpet at home so she was playing with the carpet a little bit too so -um
we just have hardwood floors so she was playing with the colors she was doing that in the waiting room too
oh really
yeah she was like trying to pick at them
thats funny
alright well im just going to stop all of the recording and equipment now
go ahead
so what do you think that she -um enjoyed the most
she really liked this pully stretchy hair on this guy
she loved that
i think just because shes really into right now just like feeling and pulling and really exploring stuff like that
she likes books
-um she loves pooh bear so she liked that
she likes the animals a lot
do you have -um pooh at home
yeah mhm
so yeah its her she got it for christmas so
its a little bit bigger than this
so it looks pretty identical to that
yeah i was surprised she didnt like the puppet more because she usually likes puppets but she wasnt really interested in that
-um what el oh she loved playing she loved the baby
she was kissing it and loving it and
which surprised me because she has babies at home but it must be the size of this one
she doesnt have one this big or this life like looking
still wet with slobber
so she loved that so that was kinda neat to see
yeah sorry bch
here honey bch
alright alright bch
okay bch
alright there you go bch
there you go bch
thats all it takes
okay so you said she does play with babydolls at home
yeah she has them
but like i said ones a small cabbage like mini cabbage patch
its about this big
and the other is -um its a a doll with like yarn hair and like a stitched on face and stuff so it doesnt look nearly as life like as that one
so she really liked that one
and so so she played with it like kissing it
yeah she was kissing it and just
i mean i played peekaboo with her at first and she liked that and then when she saw it she just kissed it all over
and she loves these little keys
shes teething right now so anything little shh keys like this anything she chews up but
and she she liked mostly everything
was there something that you -uh gave her that she didnt like
this this aggravated her
because she tried to drink from it and she couldnt
so this is upset her
does she drink from a bottle
only a little bit at night some formula
shell get a little bit of formula at night
so shes useta the bottle
so she knows whats in the bottle
so i thought this was funny that she this made her mad
but -um well i showed her something she just was not interested in at all
it was one of the stuffed animals
oh the zebra she didnt care about at all
this the seal she really didnt either
forgot about the spaghetti
she loved the spaghetti
did she
she loved that so
is that a name thats familiar to her
i mean we have spaghetti a lot
but so
i thought that was interesting
but its also i think the maybe the color or the feeling the texture of it
she really liked that but
was there anything here that you think that shes like never heard of or never seen before
oh yeah
-um let me think
-um i dont think shes ever seen a seal like this before for sure
-um we dont have a toy otter
although ive talked about otters to my so not to her though so she hasnt really seen otters much
-um and the meat
like she hasnt seen toy like food before we dont have any toy food yet
so she hasnt seen any of that but she liked it
-um so yeah
and then does at home does she prefer toys or books
she prefers toys
yeah she just eats books basically right now
and did you read books in here
yeah like -um we have this one at home and this on
we read books a lot at home
i mean gabe loves books
and so shes always reading them with us
but i have to keep her like off of them because shell chew them up
she just wants to like rip at them and chew them right now
so shell look at them for a little bit but she really likes this one
they both love mister brown can moo
the noises and they like put me in the zoo too
-um and this one she i just noticed today actually this one shed actually paid more attention to it than she normally would
so with the animals
which was good
do you have that one at home
we dont have this one
oh okay
we have lots of animal books and stuff but this one she she really paid attention longer than normal for like that type of book
was it do you think because of the ducks or the name of the ducks or the feel
she the feel she started f actually feeling it
because i ive been asking her like when we read the books okay feel here and stuff and she wouldnt
she just would like try to grab it and eat it
so i think shes actually maybe starting to understand what shes sposta do
not just eat it
its a process
it is yeah
so -um
-um do you have pretend food at home
no we dont have any yet
like i just havent bought it yet
-um but she really liked it so
oh my gosh she pulled this over
its okay for us i just -uh if she chews on it
she -um she really seemed to like it
she was chewing on i think its a piece of meat i dont even kno
and like i said the spaghetti
-um so we dont have any of that at home
she liked the cookie too
does she eat any of those foods or
no not yet
no i mean she hasnt had like a full sized anything like this
shes had like i break off crackers and give it to her but she hasnt had anything like this
but her brother has cook we like we made cookies today
oh okay
like she knows what cookies are
oh she does
she just cant eat them
i mean we have cookies in the house and stuff so
thats i think she she saw that
well its probably its probably the colors too
she wanted to chew on that maybe
but she liked that
and she liked the i dont know where it went
oh this
the mystery meat
-um yeah
yeah this though the hair
like i said this she really liked
we definitely dont have anything like this at home
or does she use the word
do you use the word bee
bee yes
especially right now we have bees all over the yard so weve been watching the bees and avoiding the bees and everything so
but i dont know i mean we dont have a stuffed bee at home at all but -um yeah
-um i thought i had one more
i had so if you hadta pick a favorite toy today what do you think it would be
i think its a toss up she loved this and but i think this really
oh no she loved the baby too
i would say the baby just because she loved ripping at this but just the way she interacted with the baby
she the way she was kissing it and really just like and loving it
that i think was her favorite thing
like she yeah it wasnt just like something to teethe on or something she really liked it
you know
and did you find that this is how she plays at home
yeah oh yeah
she just goes from one thing to the next like grabbing at everything tasting everything and
thats what she does
trying to chew on it
but like yeah she just moves from one thing to the next and like we do the very similar not as many toys but we set out different ones and i just pull out different things for her
to like change it up and then
she does go after her brothers toys so she plays with trucks a lot
so so -um
basically this is basically what she does without as much like concentration
of things
and now shes shes just started to crawl so she can move herself around to things that she wants
so -um she has more options now too
but yeah
thats good you can see what shes more interested in
i have to get her own little baby
aw its cute
yeah you have a baby bch
yes you do bch
a baby of your own bch
shes like ive been my brothers baby bch
yeah havent you bch
shes funny
youre funny bch
she really likes that
thats really neat
look what you have bch
i see you bch
oh yeah bch
we see what you have bch
shes just showing off for you
is it okay if i ask you some questions now
what do you think he liked to play with the most what was his favorite
this little cookie
how did he play with it
its kind of novel as far as a toy that he can fit in his hand really easily
so he was
i dont know
feeling it banging it
sticking it in his mouth
and he set it down and hed play something else and hed come right back to it
was there anything else do you think he is familiar with either like the name of it or the shape or the color what do you think was most attractive
it might be that its colorful or
im trying to think i cant even think of a single toy that we have that looks like this
at our house
so it might be the fact that its novel
but like i tried to show him the peas which are about the same size i thought theyd be equally interesting and theyre not
theyre just not so i think its a combination of color and
maybe size
once he got it in his hand like this
just like
what was that
you just love it
im kind of baffled
i think too i dont know it might be recognizeable as food
something that looks like food
was he putting it in his mouth
and hes just starting to get to finger foods now like where he wants to put his own food in his mouth
even though hes not very successful
hes trying
hes trying
were there any other toys that he liked playing with
he likes books in general he liked this one better than he wanted to read this one
he was navigating his own way through this one
turning the pages and feeling all the things and then you turn the page and feel the things so
he really liked that one
he liked the keys
they make a shaky noise huh
and he played with this one for a significant amount of time
and the spoon
thats pretty typical we have a lot of like long handle spoons and stuff that i let him play with he really likes those in general
i tried a couple stuffed animals and he was not interested
do you have -um keys for him to play with at home or
yeah nothing quite that small or easily to manage i think his stuff is a little more bulky to manage so i think
this is a little attractive
because its a little bit easier to wield
you think the noise was attractive
i think so
but he seemed as interested just to look at them as to shake them i dont know he shook them more than he shook other things though
i think probably the noise was important
did you try to play with the babydoll or did you try to introduce that
i didnt introduce the babydoll weve looked at babydolls at our house before and he hasnt been that interested
not yet
what do you think was the least favorite thing
not yet
in here
i dont know like i said i tried to use the stuffed animals and hes just not interested
i dont know if its
i dont know
so we try to use them at home too and its just not interesting too
stuffed animals are just not interesting
were the animal names in on the farm book do you think that any of them were familiar to him
yeah i think so i think the
well im not sure if the animal names he knows the s well i think he recognizes the sounds a little more like if i
or if i like a sheep
or like the horse whinny he really loves the horse whinny it makes him giggle
every time
so i think maybe i think he recognizes some of the animal sounds
particularly the cow the sheep and the horse
the sound effects that you bring with it
-um and then i noticed do you always call him scott or scottie what are some
its usually scott or scottie his dad sometimes calls him pants
i have no idea why
scott or scottie though most of the time
his brother usually calls him scottie
are you using any -um baby signs
just a little bit like more and book are pretty much the extent of baby signs at this point
-um how is it different than -uh playing at home
do you
-um despite i think he has a sibling so also playing together
-um his brothers at the age where he appreciates -um positive social interaction so
when he feels like his brothers entertained by him hes really happy about that so he does try to entertain scott a lot
and sing songs then plays with his toes and things like that
and he occasionally tries to read him books like he has some memorized that hell try to read to him
which is really fun
and he loves it he just eats it up
he adores his brother of course
as all younger siblings do right
and usually he wants whatever his older brother has and thats off limits
its always you know the older brothers like no im not gonna share with you
i think you played also with the clock do you think as far as a time do you have a clock at home
i have a big one on the wall
but the numbers are different
like ours we have like roman numeral numbers or whatever so
im not sure if hes familiar with it at all
pretty high up on the wall too like i was thinking about it i just dont even know if its in his range of vision most of the time hes like on the floor or on the couch and thats still like another three or four feet above him so
so do you do like -uh counting with him
we do by default because were working on it with his brother
a lot
so he does hear those
he hears those those numbers a lot
what can i do for you youre so busy playing
what can i do for you
what can i do for you
do you ever play -um like pattycake or any other types of like touchy kind of games like sensor
we do pattycake we do
called one called ball for baby
and usually what i do is i do like the little signs while im singing it and then i hold his hands and let him do them and he thinks thats very funny
and we have a mirror
like i pulled a mirror out of our bedroom
and i will sit with him on my lap and well look in and ill let him do the hand signs and he enjoys that too like he thinks its very cool to watch the baby do it
thats really cute
and then like stuff -uh tick like tickling games and things like that
oh he loves it
he loves to be tickled huh
he already knows whats coming
-um do you think he knows any of these foods i know we kind of strayed away from there but any of them being familiar or looking familiar or
thats a good question sorry ill try not to cough in the microphone -um
i dont know actually
like he is as yet hes not really started finger foods yet
most of his stuff is puree
and so what he sees or i think like the only thing like he probably recognizes is the banana
because thats the only thing he gets more up close
trying to think
like he might recognize bread because we do a lot of sandwiches at lunch time with his brother but
i dont know
hes a little bit lower im like trying to think hes his high chairs a little bit lower than
the table so his eye levels like right at the table level like maybe two inches above it would be hard for him to really see the food so i dont think so
its -uh you know
hes young
sometimes when theres another sibling they hear a lot of you know like pizza or whatever the sibling is
into yeah
-um and then are you doing like body parts with him or
mostly were doing the ones that hes excited about so were working right now with toes and feet and fingers and hands
and thats about it
i think we do eyes
weve been doing eyes too
just a final question is there anything that you think was like very different in how he played with you today
-um than usual
no i think this is pretty typical
he self-motivates a lot of his play
he likes for me to play with him but especially if a toy is new hell play by himself for a long time like without
yeah it is really nice
both of my boys are like that
he is really practicing
hes been doing this since he was born like seriously hes like the biggest chatterbox ive ever since
in fact one of our friends likes like trying to adopt right now and theyre like we just decided we just want your baby
-um the husband really likes the incredibles and youve seen like the little video of like jack like burst into flames or whatever and hes just like just like jabbering all the time
this is what he does
and so our friends like love that
bless you
you okay
you okay
got it under control
say hi sabrina
okay so that concludes the -uh
im just gonna ask you some questions
i dont have to write it down because were recording
which toys do you think he liked the best
-um the bee
and the peas
and the clock
which toys do you think he liked the least
-um most of the pretend food yeah
i mean he liked the peas
because of the texture
and it was within reach
but we havent done much or he hasnt done much i dont think with pretend stuff
does he have any toys like this at home
we do we have i mean we have good night moon
we have another karen katz book
another bright baby book
some doctor seuss
-um weve done a little bit with stuffed animals
well he has a few stuffed animals that are like his favorite
-um but were just getting into the stuffed animal thing
and he does not have pretend food
at home i dont think
-um do you think theres any items that you think your child recognizes the name of
-um i do think so
-um he was excited to see the chicken
and he has a picture of a chicken in his room right next to his changing table
that he can grab
and we always say
oh youre fighting with the chicken
so i think he definitely recognized
i think he recognized the name of that
-um and hes had keys before
and the duck
and like the the pictures in the bright baby we we go through the the names of those
-um and im sure if we had played more with the pretend bottles he wouldve recognized the word
but ah
i guess we just call it milk we dont call it a bottle
so i dont know
are there any toys you think he doesnt recognize that hes never seen before maybe
-um well he goes to daycare
like a home daycare with a wide age range
age range of kids
-um so it doesnt seem to me that they have a lot of dolls there
so like the baby doll i dont think hes familiar with
-um you know so i dont know about the food
-um im sure some of it looks very familiar
and like i know hes hes seen it before
im trying to think what else
-um yeah maybe you know donkey
kangaroo fox
theyre kind of
i dont know what this one is
i guess its a squirrel
theyre kind of not
im sorry
groundhog yes
so those are kinda like not your regular animals
-um but some of the more regular ones like chicken or frog
hes hes definitely seen before
you got it kiddo bch
good job bch
thats right bch
i know its hard it runs away from you bch
alright bch
there you go kiddo bch
do you think he prefers playing with toys or books
-um thats a good question because he likes books
but -um i think he likes the toys because theyre more independent
-um just the past week or so hes started grabbing the books and pretending to read them himself
but probably toys better
you said you have some of these books at home
-um so i thought he would be like excited to see familiar stuff
and thats where i like to start
because it gives me some confidence
like oh i know exactly how to play with you with a book
but -um so he likes the books but
its different
so he probably likes toys better
yeah so youre bypassing the book completely bch
he likes those keys
theyre fun
okay thats it
so i just have a few questions for you
okay lets see
which of the toys did he seem the most interested in
why did you think that was
he likes noisy
noisy toys
so this
-um if you hadta pick a toy that you would say was good for his personality
what would you say
good for his personality
just about anything that makes noise
at this age i would say
which toys did he seem the least interested in
hes not interested in stuffed animals so far i think
the puppet was okay but this stuff
i mean he kinda touched everything else but
id say the stuffed animal
would you say he prefers book over toys or toys over books
do you read at home
i do -um and hes just getting into books so id say toys over books right now
-um do you have any of these toys at home
-um i have something like this but
and the books but
not the food and stuff like that
and do you think he recognizes names of any of these items
i dont think so
i thought he might the bottle but he didnt seem to so
not when i say it mm
do you ever play with pretend food at home
no mm
lets see what else we have
what about animals
do you think he
see some kids are really into animals really early on and they recognize the names
does he seem
no i dont think so
okay i think thats all we have
so we can go and switch
and get them
well i have a few questions to ask you if you dont mind
and she can just sit on your lap
yeah you like that better huh sitting on moms lap
its funny the books
she can hang onto her keys if she wants
she can let go of them yeah
she likes those
it was so interesting that she really didnt like those books
yeah i wonder what
its interesting because we really only read books at night
so she associates the
it may be
the books at night
it may be
it wouldnt be the first time
we usually dont read that often during the day just at night
haha and you know huh
so -um it seemed like yeah it was pretty obvious she liked
the things she could rattle
the keys and -um
i was just gonna ask you why do you think she liked those
was it something about
i mean we have a pair that are not like those but probably kind of similar
like a different
i dont know if she recognizes like the ones she has at home
she has much like bigger ones but
that are also the keys
theyre kind of like keys
i mean theyre keys
but theyre different brand of them
so i dont know if she recognizes as a toy that shes useta
she like that one at home too
she likes to shake them
what else did you think that she liked
-um the measuring cups she seemed to really enjoy
probably because theyre the same -um concept as
hanging on a circular
shaking them
making noises
aha they made some noises didnt they
you like all the noises
-um well what do you think -um in general are toys that are good for her personality
-um she does seem to like at home
like putting balls in something
shes starting to do things like that
-um but that make noises like noise
and she knows they come out the bottom
kind of looking to see what happens and
starting to figure some things
like the cause and effect kinds of things
starting to figure out cause and effect a little bit more than
do you do that
well you like those k
are you gonna look at those keys
what do you think interested her the least of what we have here
-um well the book seemed to make her upset for some reason
not really sure why
i wonder if it does have to do with
yeah i dont know
she didnt seem to wanna wanna do that
and i dont know if its because she cant really suck on books quite as easily not shake them
theyre just not quite as fun
for her to hold and play with
-um the animals she kind of lost interest in them
-um we actually dont have a whole lot of stuffed animals at home
but we have a couple different things
but not more kind of toys that she can hold onto
yeah i think there have been a few other kids
toys that we can clean easily we have at
she just
she didnt really care for those
at least not at this visit
no not really
she kind of stared at the doll for a while
oh okay
she likes that
she does stare at like faces a lot
is that what she was doing
i couldnt tell
she was just pretty much looking at the babys face
and that was about it but
ive noticed other children shell just stare and laugh at smaller kids
much more than at adults
oh interesting
so when youre out and about or whatever and you see
mhm she goes to daycare
and theres eight infants in her class
oh okay
yeah we will have to
-um well i know she didnt like the books today
but does she have any at home that she likes in particular
that one we do read a lot
and then we have one called the bellybutton book that she seems to really
mhm those are her favorites
those seem to be her favorites
yeah the fluffy chicken
she likes to feel the different textures
fluffy chicken
is that what you like
mhm and that one has textures in it like
mhm and then she like feels the different fur on it
but i think the keys are about her favorite
-um you might have already mentioned about the keys being something that she may recognize from home
and anything else that we have here that you feel like she might recognize that you have at home
or that she might recognize from daycare
-um i mean we dont really have any of the kitchen stuff yet and all the
we dont really have any of that yet at home
yeah theres a lot of that
i mean just little animals you know we have some of those at home
just like little beaniebabies things
i would say this is probably the most like our toy at home
what were you saying sabrina
would she recognize some of the foods like in real life
yeah i dont know if she would recognize them or not
or if she
she seemed to like the can
like the soup can
and yeah i mean
what do you think she liked about th
she did sort of engage with that a little bit
one in the grocery store
did she play with those when she was in here
i mean i always kind of try to stack them up for her
shes kind of pushing them around
although i think at home she likes balls
like pushing balls around on the floor
oh they kind of do that
kind of
i saw her playing with like the slices
oh yeah oh the pizza slices
i dont
you liked that for a while
and maybe because it was small it could fit in her hand
she could easily grasp it put it in her mouth
grasp it
that could be
she could really hold onto it
like shes holding onto the
do you think she in general prefers toys or books
-um i feel like toys
more toys
more toys than books
mhm okay and
does she
like we were actually went on vacation a couple weeks ago
and her stroller its kind of give her a book
right megan
we have like a little baby laptop kind of thing at home
oh wow
and she likes to just shut it
and then shell try to open
and then shut it again
do you do any -um games with her like back and forth games -um or like rhymes
yeah i mean like that kind of stuff yeah
the peekaboo shes starting to really get the hang of it now
oh wow okay
if we duck
well play it
and thats fun yeah
shes generally just a very happy baby
she certainly seemed like it
you think shes pretty active
mhm yeah
youre a well adjusted little girl
huh youve seen a lot of other babies
well i think thats all we have
did you have any questions before -um we wrap it up
not really
if you just leave your microphone on and i can ask you some questions
that way i wont have to write anything down
-um and youll just a second
continue to eat his plate
hopefully hell just play and be happy while we talk for a minute
-um so which of the toys or kinds of toys did you think interested him the most
anything he can stuff in his mouth right now
and so what were those things
i wasnt watching him
he had this in this in the mystery meat the keys
-um he tries to eat books a lot at home he didnt try that as much here
did you read a book this time or looked at a book
we looked at a book yeah
we did goodnight moon which we read at home constantly
theres the front
yeah although this is the counting book so
its different then
i actually havent seen that one
i havent either thats why i wanted to read it
i was like oh this is for me
oh okay
-um so yeah it was the one we usually have but we also have the mr brown book but we dont read that as much at home
but hes not as interested in books as noah was at this age
cause she would turn the pages like she knew exactly what was coming next like she had certain books
he has a couple of books at home that he really likes consistently and the other ones he gets real wiggly in
hes ready to go
i mean
he likes over things
so when anna and i are reading hes always there but not necessarily attending to the book
okay so
you would say that -um at this age he likes toys better than books
yeah he does
okay and -um you said he likes the things he puts in his mouth
are there certain are there any of the toys that -um that you think are good for his personality
like you said your daughter was more into books and hes not is
there anything -um here or even at home that you think
he has a couple of truck things that he thinks are really cool
like hell roll all over the house and he does consecutive rolls to get to certain trucks
is that how he gets there
yeah and hes starting to do that -um he pivots nicely on his belly
so hell pivot and roll and hes starting to do a sorta backwards combat crawl which is usually you know emerges backward before
it goes anywhere forward
yeah so we keep finding him jammed under furniture
but yeah there are a couple of trucks that he tries very hard to get
which of the things here did you think interested him the least
-um hes not real big into stuffed animals although he thought the frog was pretty funny
so thats what he was giggling about was the frog for some reason
but hes usually not real big on stuffed animals
do you think he recognizes like the fact that it is a frog
do you do frog stories or frog ribbits things
-um no more than any other critters in our house
i mean weve got stuffed animals out of our ears
you do
and books yeah
i mean we probably read with anna a lot i mean probably an hour a day and hes usually around
but i dont think he particularly knows
this is this and this is that
mhm or animal sounds that go but he thought it was funny when you were doing that
i think he thought the jumping was funny i dont think he necessarily identified it as a frog
so i think the action to him
is more funny than the critter itself
so you showed him the frog
and we did the sea otter with eating and he didnt think that
that was at all entertaining
i didnt try the baby with him but
i dont know hes never permitted the baby at home its annas
oh i see
-um so you said you did the goodnight moon is that right
-um alright and which one of those do you think he would prefer to look at with you something familiar or
i dont know we got a couple of these caring cats books that are peek baby books
and he seems to some days he really likes them some days he really doesnt i dont know
i dont know we didnt get to this one
peek a boo
we have a couple of peek a boo books from the library that he thinks hell get the giggles for one of them too
do you play peek a boo with him
yes all the time and some days he thinks its hilarious and some days he doesnt care
oh i see
i see
it depends on what he feels like doing
just mood
yes exactly
i mean theres this one book that consistently he was just getting the giggles like just
did you tell her that huh
yes so
you funny
i know hes a goof
-um do you so you have you said you have stuffed animals
-um any other toys that are similar to what we have here
we dont have any food toys like this we have a lot of -um like rattles and teethable things you know baby rattles that are
out for him little link chains and rattles that go on the ends of the linked chains and that kinda thing and hell play with those
okay so this kinda stuff the food the plates and stuff thats new to him
we have plates
we dont have food which is interesting so
we have plates and cups and he actually he has been doing that
anna has a little set with cups with little handles like little tea cups and tea saucers that are plastic similar to this size
and hes been into those lately and theres a water like a teapot that we use as a watering can that hes been trying to nab from her
but long spout so he gets the spout in his mouth
its good to
oh i see
chew on
he really went for the -um
the plate
plate this time
let us see
but i dont know thats cause its a familiar object or because it fits nicely and its easy to hold
right easy to hold right
cause its light
its hard to know
its interesting in this study to see sometimes theres a big change even between the seven month visit and the ten month
theres a huge developmental leap
yeah and sometimes even four weeks
sometimes people we have
oh buddy
a ten months sorta around visit and
a eleven month and sometimes theres changes in two weeks if someone sees them two weeks later so
yeah its amazing what they learn and how fast
-um so i suppose hes a little young to do pretend play feeding with dolls thats the question that probably
probably better for a
little bigger
and -um is he interested in dolls at home
do you have some
-um in so much as he can chew on them
not really as a an item in itself he doesnt seem to recognize
the face or anything like that
yeah he doesnt get excited like that like he does with himself in the mirror
you know it does have
that same level of woohoo
it may happen part of it is that every time he touches a doll anna whacks him so he might have been
trained nicely to stay away from dolls
hell learn to be pretty tolerant though
thats what ive found
little ones tolerate a lot thats just
you have to right
we just hope you get bigger than her and pound her back some day
thats right
you gotta make sure they cant do that too
paybacks buddy
-um so you would oh i already asked you that he would prefer toys at this age
if he was on your lap would he wanna be read to or turn or would he wanna turn the pages himself
he wants to turn the pages himself
okay i think thats about it unless you have anything that you think is -um noteworthy that i didnt ask you about his interest in toys and stuff at this age
-um i dont know we have a dog and a cat hes very interested in them
theyre good toys
and the dog follows him around constantly because he always has food in him hes a puky little dude so the dog follows him and licks puke off of him day in and day out so hes very
we have one of those too
interested in the dog
yes i mean its good to have a dog
so totally disgusting but
i know we could of brought taloula in
that would be fun too
he just he loves his sister he loves daddy you know his familiar people he just lights up like a christmas tree when he sees them
no sorry
no we didnt sorry just toys
just stuff
well i think -um thats about it
and i will just
let us extricate you
okay so i just have a couple questions
-um okay so which toys did he seem most interested in
-um the soft stuff i think just because he could put it in his mouth
like this clock
i mean hes just into that phase right now where everything in his mouth is what he
an toda like today in particular
so i would say anything soft
anything he can put his hands on
he wasnt interested in making any kind of noise or anything like that
like he is sometimes depending on the toys he has at home
oh i would say the keys usually because they make noise
yeah like he seems to be
i dont know if this is possible yet but he seems to know that when he does something theres a reaction with the keys
-um which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
-um i think maybe this peanut butter because he doesnt recognize it
-um i tried to make noise with it a little and that didnt seem to do anything for him
-um do you read books at home
you do
like trying to read it without him grabbing it
-um so we try to get through them as fast as we can
because and then get on to the next book because hes not really looking at the pictures
and do you think he recognizes names of any of these items
i dont think so no
were there any items that you think hes never seen before
-um well hes seen similar things
but like this peanut butter that was new
-um he has the winnie the pooh thing
and my daughter has a lot of kitchen stuff
this we dont have but hes got similar things
-um do you have any toys that are the same at home
none that are the exact same
so you said you have some food but not
okay if you hadta choose between books or toys would you say he prefers books or toys
oh id say toys
definitely yeah
-um do you ever actually play with pretend food and pretend like youre feeding dolls at home
-uh my daughter does with him
and i mean hes around so i dont think
im not doing it with him but shes doing it
and hes wa and hes seeing her
so i dont know if that counts as well as playing with him doing it
does he ever play with dolls at home
not yet
well i think that is all we have
i have a little follow up -um questions
i can play with caroline
while youre jodi can
oh sure can i is it okay if i let her out of here
can come out
come with me caroline
mommys gonna going to answer some questions
ask you some questions
gonna be writing anything down because were gonna use the tape
so which of the toys seem to interest caroline the most
-um i think the -um cookie that she ate
and maybe this towards the end and the kangaroo only if i was working it
okay and which do you think is a good toy for her personality
hm -um
maybe the bumble bee
she likes things with faces and then she also likes things too that are like tactile
mhm okay
so which of the toys seem to interest caroline the least
the books
the books
and why do you think that
my older daughter was like this too and like for a certain period of a couple months
shes just too -um antsy to to sit and look at a book
like if if you could be mobile and use a book she she would be better off i think
okay so one of the questions is do you think she prefers books or toys
toys definitely
if you hadta pick a book which book did she prefer to look at with you
-uh of the ones here
oh honey
the book that we were looking at before you guys came in she liked a lot
it was like a pop up and a tactile one
but then this tactile one i think her being in the seat
made it hard for her to sit
do you want me to take her
what happened
what happened
that was a close one
i do have a binky with me but i dont know where i p
oh no its in here
alright you
-um and im also guilty of not reading too many books with her lately
-um because i because its hard
she squirms out of my lap and stuff
im not sure if that was what you were questioning me about or not
-um do you have any toys like these at home
-um yeah we have a lot of soft toys
-um we dont have any puppets
i might try puppets
and her older sister plays with all the play food and stuff which she of course doesnt you know do pretend play
but she mouths a lot
and we do have books all over
but shes not interested in books at home like on her own either
does she ever play with dolls at home
-um she climbs on them haha
but no not yet
not in any meaningful manner
thats about it
thank you very much
youre welcome
for coming
a few questions
about this session
which toys do you think amelia seemed most interested in
i mean at this point i can
you know
give her
a napkin and shes happy so
it ha
anything shes
she can have with most toys
or non toys
which toys here do you think she was most interested in
she seems to like the
you know the
the food
she also
wed actually dont have a baby at home
she kinda likes that
i think
she likes head shoulders knees and toes
so she was definitely smiling
when i was doing that
on the baby
which toy do you think is good for her personality
haha is that yummy
anything really i mean at this point
as long as she can put it in her mouth
it makes her happy
what do you think -um interests her
she likes f
she likes faces
she looked over at you a couple times
you know
shes like why isnt she looking back at me
she likes
you know like when my camera
when i take pictures of her and it
makes noises
she likes that
but we tend to not actually have very many
toys that require batteries around the house
it may just because
it may be
that she likes that type of thing because shes not
useta it as much
i do not know
-um which one do you think she was least
which toys here
do you think she was least interested in
she seems sorta interested in the books
but she tends not to be very into books
she tries to close them most the time haha
and she didnt really care about
and we never even got over there
some of the food
she didnt really care
-um do you think that there are any items that -um
well that can be for next time
that will be
thats a good plate huh
which book -um
do you think amelia would
-uh prefer to read
or look at with you
this the baby peekaboo or
we didnt look at it but the on the farm
she liked
she likes the peekaboo ones
and does she play with any similar toys at home
we dont have
food at home
like i said we have the book thats like this one
i was stacking these because we stack a lot of things and
you know like stacking toys
and im
as i said
that im gonna regret it
but im always
ha showing her how to bang things together
haha ha
which fortunately she doesnt seem to care about at this point
and do you think shes more
prefers books or toys
and you said that she doesnt have a doll at home
she has a lot of stuffed animals
but no dolls
and you said you dont have any pretend food at home
but do you think that amelia maybe recognized any of the foods
from maybe home
probably not because shes still eating so much
baby food
you know i dont
i dont think shed necessarily recognize
usually goes to bed before we eat dinner
i dont
i dont think so
and at this point do you think amelia -um recognizes
the names of any of these items
or is beginning to
the only one that i would say would be milk
we do -um
were starting a little bit of sign language with her
and we do milk and eat and more
and so shes actually started signing milk
were not really sure if she knows
that its
goes with milk
you know shes started doing this
but we dont know if shes doing it
at the times when shes hungry
but when we ask her if she wants milk
if shes hungry she usually smiles so
i dont know if that means she
knows what it means or not
or if shes just happy that
you know likes when we talk to her
are there any items that arent here that you think your child recognizes the name of
not yet
is that yummy
you want more pizza here
would it be okay if i asked you some questions
what do you think rosie liked playing the most with today
well it seems like she found her two favorite things
shes liked the keys
and i think the measuring spoon probably the best
does she have those at home
she has like
a toy key ring
thats like kind of similar
thats a teether
she likes to kind of make the same noises as that
what do you think was her least favorite
what do you think
she seemed to like this stuffed animal with these guys
but in general
she didnt seem to go for any other stuffed animals
she likes more of the stuff she can make noises with
that has some more
kind of plastic
crunches and stuff
do you think that she is familiar with the names of the animals
of those
hm no
probably not
well we talk about bees but i dont know if she would associate that with a bee
but we dont really talk about foxes
or donkeys
frogs maybe
otters dont really come up
goslings and fawns no
how about the food is she eating or using a spoon to eat
she will try to take the spoon out of my hand
when i feed her and
sometimes we will give her own spoon
-um and for food
visually similar
-um we have never had ice cream cones in front of her
-um we have eaten sandwiches and stuff
but i dont think i dont think any of these look visually enough like we eat for her
for her to make that connection
she has seen us eat a lot of cheese slices
and lately we have been giving her little bits of that
so that would probably be the one most similar
does she play with baby dolls at home
you know soft plush kind of dolls
but they dont look like babies
you know a yarn knit kitten
she likes that
all the other baby dolls that she has she hasnt got into yet
how about the books do you read books at home
we read books a lot
at home
-um yeah
and sometimes she shows more interest then others
sometimes you know she will she will just get it out to gnaw on it
sometimes she will actually turn pages
kind of play with it
and then gnaw half way through
but we have books
a lot of books upstairs downstairs
in the nursery
in the car
do you have any of the same books at home
no we havent had any doctor seuss books at home
we have this one but it looks different
its not the counting one
but none of the doctor seuss ones we have at home
do you think she is familiar with any of the animal names or sounds
she i would think she would be familiar with
because we do a lot with cows
the of the bee
we do rooster sounds at home
-um so yeah sounds like that
the animal -um like cows and stuff
she could be familiar with and colors
which this one had a lot of colors
and we do we do read lots of books
that have colors that you say
i think
i think
how about any games like -um peekaboo pattycake that kind of stuff
yes we play those at home a lot
and she really likes pattycake
she hasnt figured out what to do but when you talk about pattycake and when you do it with her she smiles
and gets animated
and excited
she thinks thats fun
peekaboo she is starting to get more into now
where she will you know pull the little burp cloth off my head
if i put it on me and find me
or pull it off herself
and we say peekaboo so thats a fun game
yeah i know
you wanna be up
well one thing that i notice whenever she is somewhere new with new toys
she will kind of sit
and observe for a while
you know she will she will get whats near her
but she kinda is an observer in the beginning
she will get comfortable and familiar
and then she will start to verbalize or vocalize
kind of get interested and going a little farther
to get stuff
but at home where she knows most of the toys
when we set her down
she just starts going you know
so as we get as we go for playdates places and stuff
in the beginning she will just sort of sit and hold court
and look around
maybe reach for something or play with what you give her
and be very quiet
and then she will start
kind of getting a little more expressive
so i think this held
true to that she kind of sat and
looked around and found something nearby like the bee
and then when she got a little bit more comfortable then she would go find other stuff
she wanted yeah
but lately especially as shes kind of
in the last few weeks
hit this kind of milestone of getting more comfortable crawling
going up to standing lately
thats been more entertaining to her
its like toys dont even have to be there
if she can just crawl on you
stand up
pull on stuff
its like everything except her toys will interest her
at this point
i just wanna stand
thats the best game of all
much to mommy to grin
because we just stand in our crib
oh you want that
you can sit down and get that
-um let us see which one rosie
i think you kind of were more interested in the sounds
one maybe
i think you were more interested when we said like
do you like the sounds better
i think so
i think that was your favorite
so the sound effects
i think the book of wonderful noises
i did it i said it
that was me
well i think that was it for today
im just gonna ask you a couple of questions
ah and so which toys do you think -um are the most interesting to him
and do you think theyre good for his personality
ah -um i think the ones that he can chew on are the ones that he likes the best
im actually surprised he didnt try to chew on your books
he enjoys that a lot at home
does he play with similar toys at home
-um i dont know what other things like this
he likes to chew on books
weve got little blocky things plasticy things we stack
and then hes got some
mostly he chews on things
mostly he chews on books
haha he got a plastic chewy one
i havent gotten him
i mean hes got little blocks whatever
i havent gotten him tons of toys because christmas is coming up
-um so which ones do you think he was the least interested in
the stuffed toys
i tried to show him a couple of those
he didnt
didnt really even look twice
alright so do you think there are any toys here that he didnt know the name of
like if you said
like this is a frog
do you think he would know
i dont think so
you dont think so
i dont think so
he might know dog and cat
but i dont know that he knows any
oh no
so you would say that he prefers books over toys you think
only in the sense that you can chew on them haha
ah but he likes to be read to
-um but i mean he likes these kind of things
anything he can put in his mouth you said
yeah haha
anything he can put in his mouth
-um does he play with any like dolls or figures at home
-um what has he got
not really
i mean ive got him a -um like a little lovie thing in his crib
he ignores that
weve got some stuffed things that make noise
he likes when i play with them
and they make noise
but he doesnt seek out
oh the ducks
you like your ducks
he does like ducks
we got some floatie ducks
thats the thing i think he likes the best
but again he sticks the head in his mouth like a pacifier
but he does like his duckies
is there anything else you think we should know about his play at this time
that i havent asked about already
i dont know
it pretty much
he likes tupperware too
ah hm okay
im like trying to think like what do we got
were got hm
i dont know
we got little things
oh i thought he would like these because hes got keys at home that he likes
i thought hed like these
but he didnt
alright well
i guess because hes gotten new and exciting things
okay i think were just about done
what do you think daniel liked playing with the most today
well he is liking the keys right now
he he loves this book at home
i dont know pick it up all the time
and he laughs a lot
and well he likes anything with different textures
i thought he would grab one of these out of my hands but he did not
the one with the animals
do you think hes familiar with any of the ones
none of them even remotely like anything we have at home
so thats probably it too
we have keys at home so
but not there different
how about the -um names of any of the animals
i dont think he would know
maybe maybe -uh
i dont think he would know any of theses these m s
maybe a chicken
he might say that occasionally
certainly not an otter
there are two otters
-um what about -uh so the books at home
yeah we have we have these two
and plenty others
we we read a lot so
he tries to
i do not know
he likes to pick up books and eat them anyway
i dont know if he actually cares about words but
he really likes to pick up that book
im sorry
well he likes to pick up books anyway
and his favorite book at home is yellow also
do you read a lot of doctor seuss in particular
we just read whatever we have
though he does like this book a great deal
sometimes he laughs just on the first page
what is it called
mister moo
mister brown can you
oh okay
so you do all the sounds when you go through it
anytime that i do like animal noises he laughs
well not any kind anymore
now hes more particular hell only laugh at the really funny ones but
did you just spit up dan
hold on a second let me get something
but yes he he likes hearing animal noises
i think its just because its mom and dad making sounds that we dont usually make that he knows were not sposta make
that he recognizes as not normal
do you think you played -um similar to how you would at home
he was completely uninterested in all this stuff
he didnt even look at it which was kinda weird
usually if theres an array of toys like this at home he would be diving into four different ones so
i usually wouldnt offer him that many at once
just because he wouldnt focus on any one thing he would just dive into every separate thing
so did he play with the food
he didnt even look at it
like its all within the reach
you see he was able to reach over and grab the books
and could easily reach forward and grab those i know he can
but he didnt even like look at them
at home
we dont have any of this stuff at home yet
does he play more at home books than toys
hell play with whatever hes got in the room
kind of considers these as his toys also but like
he has i do not know balls and blocks
trains and things
he does have some stuffed animals
they just dont look like these
about the right size though
we do have a couple puppets
but we havent gotten them out yet
-uh what parts of the story
oh you said it was the sound effects
oh yeah
and then -um
and the books that have textures
hes just discovering that he can touch the textures
he likes that
do you think he recognizes any of the names of the animals in the book on the farm
maybe once hes actually seen some of the animals in person but
i dont think he recognizes them
i think he yeah like i said he recognizes that the sounds are not sounds that people make
and so in that sense he knows that there funny
did he wanna play with the baby doll today or
i dont know if hes ever even seen one
i mean we dont have siblings and we only have enough toys for his appropriate age
so i dont think
hes just never seen one that i can think of
so his favorite thing -uh i think i heard you say were the books right today
or the keys you said
well yeah right now i would go back to the books
we have that book at home too
the foot book
and his least favorite thing
well i tried even this i tried to pass him this
stuffed animals i would say actually
the stuffed animals would have to be least favorite
least favorite today
there he goes going towards the food
yellow i think that he likes yellow
its fuzzy
so it could be you know -um colors and sounds
could also just be things hes able to pick up
anything he can put in his mouth right
like i said i would assume that you clean everything between children being here
but -uh yeah
we definitely have to do that
well alright
should i pass you this back
good job little will
im going to ask you some questions about the play session
and im not gonna write anything down because we have the audio
so -um
-um probably the spoon
i think he loved to chew on it and hold it and
-um you know i mean thats something that hes very familiar with
and something thats fun to hold and to chew on and
these he plays with these at home
-um somewhat and
-um probably just things that are just squishy that are nice things to hold in his hand
and texture feels fun he likes to chew on them hes teething
-um i think the baby definitely had interest in the baby because he likes faces and -um
my mother gave his big brother a baby doll that -um he doesnt really play with
and so i think he just likes faces so thats definitely of interest
-um ah in contrast which of the toys sorry which of the toys interested him the least
well this thing i think the texture didnt feel good on his face when i was kind of playing with it so
he made a really disgusted face
-um i dont know i think he likes things that make noise and things that are -um
movement so if you know the tower he likes the towers and
-um the book didnt seem to interest him at all
do you think -um any of those books you know in a -um a day obviously when you arent here any of those books would interest him or
-um i would say like books with faces babies he likes to look at that
-um he certainly is read a lot to
but more because im reading to his older son before bed
and hes sitting on my lap too
and -um so -um maybe he has the second child syndrome
little wills dont chew on this
-um that he -um doesnt get as much personal attention as his older brother i think
picking out like age appropriate books it just doesnt happen as much
we read good night moon a lot
this is not good night moon i know but
-um so i dont know
are there any toys that are similar
i know you said you have the kind of a baby doll at home
are there any toys at home that are here or any toys here that are similar to ones that you have at home
-um well he has a sippycup -um
hes familiar with that
ah we dont have any play food or anything like that
but i mean in terms of the shape like i mean we have -um
he has blocks
his brother is playing with legos the duplos a lot
i dont know if the shapes are not really similar
keys we have a set of keys
he has a set of toys keys he does
-um right you have some keys that look a little bit like this
so -um i know you said that you dont have much -um toy food at home is there anything besides the sippycup that you think he would have recognized
he would certainly recognize all of these as toys
things that would be fair game anyway
but -um we have little beaniebabies
but he doesnt take much interest in them
he doesnt touch them or stroke them or pick them up
i mean hes picked them up and chewed on them before
-um and at this point do you think that there -um are any names of these toys now that he would recognize you know it seems like you know baby you know that kind of a familiar thing are there
spoon for sure
-um probably -um cup
-um plate for sure
book for sure
probably about it
i mean toast
whats the matter wills
whats the matter
-um maybe some of the animals maybe he would rec like
i mean -um horse or teddy bear or something like that maybe
but thats about it probably
okay alright well great thank you so much and we can go ahead and get the mic from you
go play
go play
so what do you think he liked playing with the most
these animals
we dont have these at home
we dont have any of those stuffed animals
so i think those were completely different for him
he does have -uh keys carries ar that he uses all the time
so he did like these too
or his other ones
those were his two favorite things
i think so
yeah and we dont have any of these plastic foods
so i think that was interesting
but -uh we do have a lot of books
but he didnt seem that interested in them here
-um with regards to the animals -um were some of the names familiar to him
like from books or
-um definitely the dog and like a
yeah and the fox would be the two that i think were familiar
so the other ones i would not so much
which ones do you think were like really uncommon for him
-um in terms of the names like the zebra and the frog
oh goodness
winnie the pooh we havent done
one second
ill be out soon
its okay
sorry about that
thats okay
-um so definitely like the dog and the fox i know we have stories about
but like winnie the pooh hes not familiar with
because im not writing anything down
something happened to the
was it like a
oh there it is
there it is
yeah just
so how did you play with the animals today
did you think that he liked it
well today what i only did was i just like put them infront of him and named them
-um i think other ways i could have done it is to kind of go on this side and use different voices to play with him
and i didnt do that
-um but that would be something else that i could do too
and then the food
do you think it was there where there any names or colors or looks that were familiar to him
do you think
not yet
i dont
he doesnt really eat anything like this yet
-um i think he was attracted like the he really liked the icecream cone and the peas
those are his two favorites
-um and hes eaten peas
but they dont look like that when he eats them
and he hasnt had icecream yet
how did you play with the food
did you try
how did you play with it
-um it was kind of the same thing
just kind of putting it infront of him and naming it
and then trying to build things
so i guess showing him how you would use the food in real life
-um but you cant
i would have a more difficult time i guess getting creative with that than i would with the animals
i can see that
did you like build meals and things
i tried to
they werent necessarily meals youd eat together
like waffles and peas you wouldnt put together
but trying to put stuff together
was he at all interested in the baby doll
he was interested in looking at it
and he smiled at it
so -um and we dont have any dolls at home either
so -um i think he was yeah he was just interested in looking at the face
but he wasnt interested in touching it or anything
does he play with other infants
he does play with other infants
because he is in daycare a couple days -um a week
so hes with like -uh theres six of them in a room
including him
and they all know each other
because theyve been there f for a while
so hell react to those infants
and then the books
we have this one at home
and we have this one at home
but these
the two that i read we dont have at home
-um but we have a lot of books
we -um go to the library to get the books
so they kinda change differently
so -um but normally he really likes those
do you ever play like pattycake
yeah we do
-um but today you didnt do any like outside of these toys today
hm no just the
but and he just learned how to clap so its thats -uh patty cakes pretty fun for him
and peekaboo
he loves boo
at home too we do that
and so he sits and listens
if you were to say toys versus books here today what do you think
i think he would understand
or at least we have like a play area and then we have like a big basket of books
and so whenever he sees us pull out the big basket hell like shriek
you know thats kind of how he shows happiness right now
and i dont know
maybe its because we cuddle with him more when we read
and we both will read to him
both my husband and i
-um but he seems to get happy and then hell like shriek while were reading sometimes too
but hes also just started scooting so hes really interested in moving right now
-um but so at home it was
i guess you just gave me a comparison
at home he seemed a little bit more interested or excited about books
well yeah because we dont just leave them out because their library books
so when we bring them out he knows were going to read to him and then he gets happy
where as his toys we kinda just leave out
you know so he can get them whenever he wants
okay that makes sense
thats so funny
hes like looking at the baby and saying
what are you eyeing at
its my clock
okay well great
i -um i think thats it
got through all the questions
he can keep playing while we talk
you keep chewing on those keys bch
say there good eating bch
so which toys do you think he was most interested here
i think he likes books but he prefers i think the hard toys you can bang and beat and stack
that seems to be what he goes for the most
-um which ones were the least interesting
-uh probably the doll or the stuffed animals
as he reaches for them
proves me wrong
probably the doll then
because he had no interest in the doll
-um do you have toys like these at home
yes we have everything but the doll
books stuffed animals and then all these kinda toys
-um do you think that he would prefer to look at a book or play with toys
depends on his mood
probably play with toys more than look at a book
he loses interest in books pretty quickly but
he likes the lift flap books the best
so if you have those then he look at those for a while longer
do you have any of these books at home
we have several of these and then lots of the doctor seuss books
-um do you think that there are any items that he would recognize the name of
not yet -um
not if you told him to get something he wouldnt find it or look at it
not yet
what about the food items do you think he would know any of those
does he eat any of them at home or
he eats them but they dont look like that
the peas definitely dont look like peas you know
hes still in jar food so
but -uh he probably wouldnt recognize you know what they were
-um lets see
and you said you dont have dolls at home right
is there anything else you
you want the book bch
think we should know about his play
maybe things he didnt do here or toys that he has at home that he doesnt play with here
-uh no not really -um
some of them are loud and musical and stuff like that where he hasta push buttons to make you know it make music or noises or whatever and
he will do that
where you going bch
you done bch
-uh huh
here bch
but no most of these are the same type toys we have at home
same things he plays with
what bch
here you wanna read bch
you wanna lift the flaps up bch
peekaboo bch
is there anything else you think we should know in general
not that i can think of
okay were all done here
okey dokey
actually laughs
thats a pretty interesting carpet isnt it
hey look
doing the obstacle course now
youre a happy girl though
such a great job
so donna what do you think -um interested her the most in terms of what we have here -um types of toys
the amount of toys
she seemed to like these a lot
just the shaking and
think it was
just making sounds and stuff
i think its
are there any that you see that you think are good in particular for her type of personality the kind of kid that she is at this point
i think she likes things that she can manipulate a lot so thats why i didnt really go for these because i didnt think that shed be into
you know something to just look at and hold
-um although i think she liked feeling the textures a little bit
i see
but -uh
but do you think
but she she seems to be more interested in things that she can kind of manipulate
and ac actually at home she just likes to play with like pieces of paper and crumple them up and
-um i know she likes to put things in her mouth a lot too but she yeah
she likes things that she can kind of do something with
at your belly
so the toys that she could make a sound with do you feel like those were that type of a thing and she probably likes that for that reason
i think she she seemed to be more interested in that
does she
she likes things that she can shake and
i was gonna going to say does she have any toys like that at home
yeah weve got little teethers and things
i think i left the one in the car that i brought with us but its like -uh -um a teether and its got little rings on it
and -um so she can kind of shake them and she can feel them and move them around
the rings around and stuff
she likes that
i think i know what youre talking about theres
theyre making some really good things for babies these days
yeah this ones like a a butterfly and the wings are kinda crinkly
oh so they make a crackly sound
oh okay
she likes that
she likes that
-um did she see a book that she liked in particular in the book bin did you think
-um she didnt really seem to go for one in particular
i mean she i think she looked at that one with the ducks on the cover maybe
a little bit
a second or two longer so thats why i pulled that one out for her
does she have a favorite book or books at home that you have that she likes to look at with you
not really
you know its really sad i have so little time to spend alone with her because i have two and a half year olds and -uh
thats understandable
that is
i was just wondering if shes attached sometimes
it seems like she likes -um some of the cloth books we have that have also again squeakers and crinkly things and things that make noise
around the side perhaps
im not writing anything down donna because were getting it on there so i dont have to write
just attach it over here
thats right
you wanna check everything out
-um so i was gonna going to say it sounds like she
you wanna wanna check it all out
prefers toys over books would you say thats
-um at this point yeah
i dont know that ive spent enough time reading to her that shes maybe hasnt been exposed to books that much
maybe -uh one of the subsequent visits that will be more clear
you know well see how she changes over time
do you
its also funny for me i i know -um usually when i play with her im holding her like this
so its kinda funny for me to to have her in front of me and
it was a little bit unnatural for me but -um
i see okay thats interesting to know
so if you did play with her shed be more like this
a lot of times yeah i spend sitting with her like this
yeah mhm
and -uh she often doesnt just doesnt like being put down
so yeah i think
she likes
shes just in a really good mood right now and shes you know
she sure is
so she did fine with that
shes feeling pretty secure
yeah at home a lot of time she cries if shes put down on the floor because maybe she thinks im gonna going to go run off and do something else
she likes to be close to you
yeah she does
-um i mean were just wondering if if shes interested in pretend food at all or -um those kinds of things or dolls anything like that at home
i mean you already told me that she really likes things she can manipulate so
she can
kinda like this
she can play with but she has a little -um like -uh its a humpty dumpty just like a little soft toy
its got a hole in the middle of it so she can kind of hold on to it and she seems to like that but yeah mostly she likes
you like action huh
she likes action
you like to shake and make noise and see what will happen if you do this to that
is that what its about right now ellie
that sounds about right doesnt it
shes got something its like a soft block and then -um i think its got
trying to remember
its got a little bell inside so when she shakes it it kinda kind of jingles and then it its got different little textures on it and things
ive seen some like that some of them have things on the sides like a mirror
yeah i think it has a mirror on it
and its got a little flap
it just has like a pattern on the outside and then when you lift the flap theres a picture of a bear underneath
so she sometimes likes that one
she likes to play with that one
very cool
okay well are there any sort of toy related -um things that i didnt ask you that you think are are pertinent to what shes interested in at this point
toys or objects or things
i think she ends up -um kind of crawling amongst her sisters toys a lot so she -um
youre influenced huh
yeah she is very influenced by the two year olds and -um
you know so a lot of the like smaller plush toys and little teethers and things that i had when her sisters were infants -um i just havent even really taken out for her because its just too much stuff
so shes happy enough crawling among their things right
yeah she is and they have a lot of like cars you know not not things that -um you know have small pieces or anything like that
just things that
things that -um
things you might not normally buy for a seven month old
but shes getting exposed to them anyway
well thats very good
okay well thats all i needed to ask you at this point
so we can
and you did such a great job ellie
couldnt have asked for a better happier baby
have to remember that to bring a bottle with me next time too
you can keep playing bch
-um okay
was there a particular group -um of toys that she seemed most interested in
the books
she hasnt left there in since i sat her down
-uh do you have any idea why that might be
we have a lot of books at home
were a book reading family
her big sister reads books constantly
-um do you have any of these
-um we have goodnight moon in a different version not the counting version
-um we do have a peek a baby but not that one
we have a a where is mommy but that same -um series
-um what about which group was she least interested in
seemed to be the play food
this one
-um why would you say that
-um well every time i tried to give her a piece you know she would hold it but then she would put it down and go right back to the books or to the the bee she had over here
do you have any play sets at home
we do
we have tea sets and play food and and she plays with them when her big sister is playing with them
but not usually on her own
she did
yeah she really likes this bee
i think the the contrasting colors really got her
-um but she she didnt wanna come over here and check any out
she wanted to stay with the books
-um do you think she might recognize any animals
probably not
i mean she might know winnie the pooh and frogs but not
yeah bch
yeah im talking about you bch
careful bch
youre standing on a book silly bch
there we go bch
-um what about dolls do you guys have dolls at home
we have dolls everywhere
has she played with them
she would like to but again big sister theyre her dolls
even the dolls that are for mackenzies only -um jackie tends to take
so she doesnt get much of a chance to play
-um when shes not that interested in them other than to like gum on them and then throw them down so
-um shes kinda young but might she recognize any of the foods we have
probably not
she doesnt eat any of them yet so
shes still on baby food and bottles
she actually she might recognize the bottle
i was a little hesitant to give it to her only because shes getting to be the time when its her bottle time
oh yeah
and i didnt want her to like scream at me for taking it away
i think youre all done
-um is there anything else about like the way she plays at home
favorite toys or anything
she no she doesnt shh i mean she doesnt really have any favorite toys
she she likes to follow what her big sister is doing
and play with that
or -um play with things i dont want her to play with which is pretty normal but
she does have a favorite -um lamb stuffed animal kinda like this size that she sleeps with and cuddles when shes upset
-um but not really a play toy
i think we are all done
yeah bch
we -um briefly looked at the icecream cone and he saw the waffle
the waffle anything else
mm no
he didnt go there really
any of this stuff or
-um i picked it up but he didnt really pay attention when i looked at it
yeah bch
what other items did he like to play with
he loved the keys
and the spoon
and the foam clock
and we read the book put me in the zoo
you going to the zoo bch
and we played with the white seal a little bit
yeah bch
does he like play dolls or things like that at home
well with being a brother he doesnt have any dolls at home
-um right now he plays with a lot of like -um rings that stack
-um and he has a couple of -uh musical toys like drums and those kinds of things he really plays a lot with
and books a little bit
do you remember what else you showed him maybe
he briefly looked at the doll but he had no interest
i showed it to him and hes like oh
he just smacked it in the head with the keys
you dont like these do you bch
unless its a real one huh
you like icecream bch
say i havent really tried it yet bch
probably a good thing bch
huh bch
i guess with an older brother theres not many dolls in the house huh
im sure by next time hell wanna venture more
he didnt even blink did her
hey do you see this over here bch
what is that bch
does it look rea bch
no bch
no interest huh bch
no bch
its real enough
i know
i dont understand why hes just like no
no dolls
especially not that kind
you gonna tell her about it bch
you like to talk bch
yeah bch
you are cute bch
my goodness bch
dont put that in your mouth bch
its okay they clean them all after
but im trying to teach him not to put everything in his mouth
otherwise itd be everything huh
how you doing bch
youre a talkative guy bch
say i gotta make sure i keep my attention span with everybody bch
since my brother likes to take it away bch
yeah older siblings do that dont they bch
are you a younger sibling
no im an older
oh me too
i talked for my brother
poor kid didnt talk
hes bigger than you though bch
hes twenty one bch
you love keys dont you bch
you think you wanna drive a car bch
hm bch
oh thatll be the day
yeah bch
i think youre a little too small to see over the steering wheel bch
for the short people
he can still play
hehe say great
im just gonna ask you a few questions
-um what do you think she liked playing with the most
-um probably the soft plush toys
either that or the books
but yeah probably the soft plush toys
do you have any of these toys at home
-um nothing identical
i mean we have soft toys
and we have books
are they animals
that are toys
are they
she has a little buddy
that she likes but it
very different its not at all like that
do you think she prefers playing with books or toys
at home
she prefers playing with things she can put in her mouth
so i dont know if there is a big difference between books and toys
as long as its roughly bite sized
that makes sense
do you think shed recognize the names of any of the things you played with today
i dont know
i dont think so
i mean maybe she knows the word book
any of like the animal names or
i dont think so
body parts
i mean
i think sometimes she knows nose
and i think sometimes she knows feet
because we talk about noses and feet
a lot for some reason
and i think she knows the word for dog
but we didnt play with the dog
today but we have dogs at home
and i think she knows that one
do you ever play with baby dolls at home
i dont know why
we dont
she has a little picnic package at home
thats soft
its like a picnic basket
and it has stuff to make a sandwich
like a chicken leg and a banana
she likes that cause she can chew on it
so i dont know if that falls into the fake food or the plush category
but its definitely bite sized
its her primary requirement
alright -um is there anything here you thought she would like the least
i mean i didnt even try with the baby doll i guess
i dont know why
maybe cause she looks a little unhappy
when i open
the books and toys
that you have around here
that -um if you hadta pick one that would
that she didnt like
the most disinterested let us say
maybe the zebra
and the goodnight moon
i mean it would be pretty arbitrary for me to say
yes she liked this no she didnt like that because
i think she pretty much enjoyed all of them
she loved the little caterpillar guy that you guys just gave her
she loved this
was that her prize
thats good
thats good
and then the books that you have at home cause i notice here you guys chose a lot of books here
-um any of the similar like
we have
other books by this author
and we have other doctor seuss books
shes read goodnight moon
we dont have it at home but she sees it at her cousins house
so and she has a farm animal book thats similar to this its
not exactly the same but its like touch and feel with farm animals
so yah she has similar books to
all of theses these m s
so shes probably seen all different the animals in them
okay well i think thats it that was simple and easy hehe
easy enough
thank you so much for coming in
actually dont needta write anything down
because im recording
itll pick up my place
how did you feel how do you think she -um this kind of compared to how you play at home usually
this is a lot more one-on-one time than she gets at home
and who are you usually playing with -um
yeah well i try to play with both of them but
hes a little more demanding
of the attention
so she gets a little more attention now
-um does she have did you find that you play with similar things at home
oh weve got
a play food
weve more trucks at home
lot more trucks
she likes the trucks
we have books
we dont have a lot of stuffed animals
i think she has one
did you say you have play food
we do
have play food
-um but thats normally in the kitchen and were we normally play in the living room
so she really plays with a lot more trucks
she always
has a lot more trucks
are her brothers
trucks and building blocks and things like that
well thats good
pieces of floor mat
no youre fine you were absolutely fine this is actually
the -uh what do you think she recognizes the names at least or finds familiar any of the names for some of the toys that
play food
i dont think so
i dont think so
cause you dont need any of this stuff yet
what would you play with from this pile that you that
we played with the spaghetti the waffles the peas
the cookies the pizza
the icecream cones
and now shes just playing with the juice
-uh i think thats about it
she got the box of peas
do you think she -um i mean do you have those in your set do you have those in like
we have spaghetti
we have pizza
i dont think i have icecream
i dont think we have peas
i know we have cookies
so yeah
do you think that -um she was kind of more familiar with those or she just happened to
the color was what do you think attracted to her
i think she liked shes i dont know i think she likes to pick things up and stick them in her mouth
do you like to pick things up and stick them in your mouth
on our spaghetti the meatballs arent attached
its a separate piece
i always thought maybe maybe because its not all white
is our spaghetti all white
do you do you think she enjoys -um reading books or playing
with toys more
she doesnt get a lot to read a lot of books
so i think she likes playing with the toys more
with nathan you know
everyday we read books
with her not so much
we just
dont hold still long enough to read books
we just dont hold still
do you think she enjoyed it today
i think so
she didnt pay much attention to me reading the book
she was too busy playing with the toys
okay how about -um other games that you might play like -um earlier you had been playing -um like chase or something but
or like pattycake or even what like the book you were playing with the book earlier
the peekaboo
we dont play any of those
she just doesnt i feel bad but youre like doing your study like first kid second kid
i mean no its absolutely trust me thats not anything
dont feel bad
we jump we bounce we -uh she loves to stand up
light yeah
do you think she recognizes did you play with any stuffed animals today
i tried to
i showed her i showed her everything but -uh
she picked up the eagle and that was about it
but i showed her everything
anything familiar from that child
or home or just a name or
no unless its mickey mouse
nathans really into mickey mouse so
of course her face lights up as soon as mickey comes on the tv
was she into -um
she liked the clock i think cause she could pick it up and it was big
did you like this
its got a face on it too
what do you think she liked the most today
it seems like she loves the spaghetti
do you like the spaghetti
and -uh what do you think she
liked the least
probably the stuffed animals
because we at least made it through a book
you know
i would have to
say the stuffed animals was the least
youre really a toy company arent you
yeah that would be good that would be good
im sure we would all get paid a little bit more
im sure you would
what working for hours and hours and hours for no money isnt fun
do you
we have keys at home too so
you like them
you like them
do you have babydolls or anything similar to
we do have a babydoll
-um that my mom got for nathan to get ready for
but -um its never really played with
it has a rattle in the head so we do rattle its head sometimes
but -um
its just not not a favorite
okay so today wasnt
this is nothing abnormal
we have more battery operated toys i guess at home too
so you know theres lights and whistles and stuff
and how does she play with block is it
she picks em up and puts em in her mouth
pretty much
its her thing right
thats her thing
shes orally fixated
and discovering the world right
are you orally fixated
was there anything else you thought
she was really interested in or really opposed to that was
interesting today
i think that she no
i dont know
i think that she liked to chew on things
do you like to chew on things
thats what i think
i think you like to chew on things
and it really doesnt matter what it is
exactly shes happy
shes much happier than her brother
thats good
are you a happy baby
okay well then thats
anything else
she can play just keep playing over here
its hard to play with people watching
yeah sure is
they get familiar
they kind of remember the set up and the toys are the same
a little bit overwhelmed
overtime what they like
what changes or the way the play with toys and how it changes its kind of interesting
but as far as todays visit what did you feel that was attracted to most
-um these things i think that resemble boobs
i guess the
you dont think she thought it was food
-um i do not know i mean i dont think ive ever given her anything that looked like that
but she likes hard plastic stuff at the moment
so did she like any of the other plastic things
-um no she fixated on the peas and the pastas i guess
hard plastic
nice texture on the gums i guess
now youve got this
so she liked to put stuff in her mouth right now
and this stuff
so do you feel like thats the reason that shes attracted to that kind of stuff because its
i think because i think these things felt good
and she chewed on them
but its hard plastic
shh she doesnt like stuffed animals
like she doesnt play with them ever
and i guess its the same here
so she didnt like any of those
well she liked this thing because its its kinda gross
they all seem to like that
shes not into books either at the moment
so its just like home
same stuff she cares about at home that she does here
do you have some of the same kinds of things at home that you
-um i have
i didnt show her these books but we have the keys that she didnt care about and the measuring stuff she has and she doesnt care about and this she loves because its a bottle
so i didnt think she would recognize that as something that she could drink from
does seem like she
-um so i was gonna ask you that too she may recognize that as something that shes seen before used before
-uh huh
well i mean
is there anything else you feel like she could recognize
either the names of or what they are
this thing she has but
you know this guy bch
is that winnie the pooh bch
okay so you have some stuffed animals at home but she doesnt like
she doesnt have any play food yet i guess thats what i should get her
does she have other plastic things at home
she has lots and lots of plastic things
nothing that looks like this though
or that
yeah like rattles and
things designed for somebody her age
i guess
and does she have any dolls at home
she has one thats smaller than this
and -uh she likes to chew on its face and she tried to chew on this ones face
her head as well so
i think she recognized the the babydoll
you recognize this guy bch
same features
somebody wanna eat bch
seems like when they do like the dolls its the face
you sure do notice bch
lets see what else i have for you
so did she like
oh you already answered that she liked the spaghetti
i was gonna say did she like plastic stuff all pretty much equally
she likes plastic stuff
so it doesnt matter what it is it was just good
what else
what else
does she have any toys at home that she really does like that we dont have here
she doesnt have like a a favorite preference of toy its just whatever happens to be given to her is what shell play with for a couple seconds but then shell move on
-um the things she likes right now is paper
like ill just give her a magazine to tear up
and things that make noise when you shake them like that
i know that she does not like anything soft
and do you think theres a reason for that
-um probably not fun to chew on i would say
and doesnt make noise
the two most important things
is there -um any kind of toy that you feel would be good for her personality whether you have it or not or we have it or not is there anything about her that you feel like would be good
-um like what she has right now because she waves her arms a lot
and if it makes noise when shes waving her arms i think thats what makes her happy
she does seem happy
and remote controls shes also very into
they have to be real ones
what does she do with those
-um chews
so i went and i actually got her a real remote control to use and she likes it
oh that wouldnt be surprising
because were both
oh and she also likes computer keyboards
i just things that react when pressed and manipulated
so its hard to say
likes the response
is lets see
does she know the names of any -um animals at this point
oh well she knows maybe cat or kittie because we have three
but i guess like what do you mean by know
well would she recognize that word perhaps
dorothy kittie bch
kittie kittie bch
maybe not
hard to say when theres so much other distractions
kittie bch
kittie kittie bch
kittie cat bch
yeah bch
you like your kittie cat bch
i think she knows
and would she recognize the names of any food
or drink
-uh milk she knows
but i think thats it
did i not ask something that would be good to know about what she likes to play with or how she likes to play
-um she likes to play alone
thats why it was hard for me to play with her because normally like she doesnt interact with me so much as she just does her own thing
like she can be on her own for long periods of time
i do not know if thats helpful or not
yeah thats very helpful yeah
so shes happy playing by herself
thats great
very good
well im gonna go ahead and turn this stuff off
okey dokey
he can keep on playing
so do you find that if he was going for anything in particular
yes i found that he hm he was really interested in the cylindrical shapes
like these
and -um really brightly colored
like these pizza things he was interested in this
these are food these are things we dont have at all at home
so it was mostly things that he had never really seen before
he was very interested in exploring
when i tried to show him books though
he was like eh i wanna see this right now
so he kinda looked at it for a second two different types of books that i read
which books did you read
-um on the farm
and goodnight moon one two three
and -um
we have goodnight moon and its a very similar illustration
to that book so he looked at it for a minute and then he went back to doing what he wanted to
which is not really uncommon anyway but i thought it was interesting cause he wanted to try all the new things
are there any food items that you think like were familiar to him like things that you did have at home
spoon yep
the spoon -um
he has a sippy cup that looks a lot like but only a bigger version that hes just starting to learn how to use and
and -um he was really interested in this when he first came
and then he saw like hed never seen pizza
i mean you know not that it looks like that
-um and also he was really interested in the baby doll he has a few stuffed animals but he doesnt have any dolls so im not sure if hes every really like played or seen with a baby doll before
and its almost the same size when i had had the baby doll sitting up he was like looking right at it eye to eye so
he seemed kinda interested in that
hes really rollie pollie right now
he likes to roll around
hes getting ready to being mobile soon
does he still just get milk or does he ever get juice or
no juice he gets formula and breast milk and -um he started on solids two months ago
does he know any of his like animal sounds yet
he has this little -um dogs yes because we have two dogs but he has this little baby einstein like -um thing that makes animal noises
im not sure if he could actually equate those with
the animal on the farm but -um but they make like
oh hes so cute
thank you
did he go for any of the stuffed animals it doesnt look like it
no he has -um a few stuffed animals and -um things like that
he really was not interested in them interestingly ive like tried to get him to play with a few of them and hed look at it and kinda smile and then go back to all the colorful things
he liked the ice cream cones a lot too
and these little spaghetti type ones
he seemed to like the round shapes too like hed go for a lot i guess a lot of these are round shapes
he went for the bread a couple times too
i wonder if hes actually like sorting them by
by shape or color
he was just picking up stuff and then putting them back down
would he know what some of these things are like peanut butter and
not yet -um hed know peas but they dont look like this cause his peas are still really theyre pureed peas
but peas are his favorite food
nope no
victor no
mm yeah oop
we dont needta do that
did he ever play with the clock at all
he did when i showed it to him he kinda just looked at it and then when he like kinda fell over and then rolled back onto his stomach to play and then he was interested in it
and what kind of things did he do with the baby doll like
he just smiled at it
he didnt and kinda reached for it but he didnt really
did you do anything with the clothing or anything like that
-um the shoe
he played with the shoe was separate the little pink shoe and then i put the shoe on him and showed him that babys shoe victors shoe but i dont know if he really got the correlation yet
lets see
does he see plates at all at home
he does yeah he was interested in the plates too mhm
hes feed out of little bowls but -um but yeah we have plates at home
so i heard you talking about pears do you make them
yep he eats pears all the time but he doesnt usually see them whole like this though
maybe ill introduce them to him and he was also very interested in the pear as well
let us see
let us see
has he ever been to the zoo before has he ever seen it
the zoo animals
not yet
farm animals
not yet
we have -um oop no
not yet unfortunately
we were going to go to the petting zoo and then we got rained out so
you gotta see the cows
hes seen them like
driving by but not like up close
do you live in a rural area
my parents do
oh okay
and horses hes seen horses before
so what kinda things
what kinda do they have on the farm
in the farm area
-um they have cows and horses
cows and horses okay
and then he sees all different types of dogs which really interest him cause like especially when they bark
i like gods too
you like the doggie
does that taste good
okay well i think thats pretty much it
thats all we got
yeah you can keep playing
you like the spoons i can tell
well she was interested in these plates -um at first
i dont know why the color or the shape maybe
but then once she had the spoons thats about it
-uh she really didnt you know if i showed her something shed be distracted for a second
but she really i guess likes these the noise they make or something
i guess she likes things that make noise
does she play with anything else that makes noise
-uh she had the keys for a little bit and was shaking them
but -um when she discovered the spoon she seemed to like them best of all
and you think its just because of the noise probably
well she seemed to have liked to grab the big one
i think it was easy to hold and she would just shake it around
i think she liked shaking it around
she would drop them and she would you know shed have the big one and then shed switch to having all the little ones
and then switch back to having the big one
it was interesting
we dont play with measuring spoons at home maybe well have to get you some huh
yeah i was gonna ask you if she played with anything similar to these
well we have measuring spoons when we cook in the kitchen
well give her like a spoon or a cup we dont give her you know all of them together so no
do you think she would recognize something like that do the single ones you give her are they anything like these
are you talking about just like a regular spoon
no she had a measuring spoon and a measuring cup the other day
so she might recognize them
i mean theyre white
theyre similar shape
but weve never given her like a group of them connected
they could also be similar to like you know keys that she tries to take from us that i dont let her have
like car keys and stuff
okay so shes seen keys
but she didnt want these she wanted these
you like those
did she -um play with any of the other food or
she was rolling this around for a little bit
trying to -um
and she picked up this as well for a little bit
and the cheese for a little bit
bef -um shes and then just a second ago she had the slice of pizza
shes just i noticed she tends to like to pick up flatt flatter things
i think theyre easier for her to hold
when she tried to pick this up she had more of a problem with it
did she -uh show any interest in any of the books
-um i tried to show her a book and she pushed it away
she was like i wanna play with the keys
stop distracting me
no books this time
no book this time
how about any of those stuffed animals
no i tried to attract her attention with the frog
and the dog and even the puppet
moving it around and having it talk to her kiss her and she would look at it but then she went straight back the -um measuring spoons
and how about the baby doll
she smiled at it -um but she didnt really -um she wanted to play with the spoons
but she looked at it
she did she looked at it she smiled at it
she even made like a little noise but then she went back to spoons
so out of all these things obviously the measuring spoons were the favorite what about the n if those werent there what would you say would guess would be the most interesting for her based on her personality or what you see at home
-um anything that can she make noise
she likes to shake things like rattles and things like that
but if it wasnt the measuring spoons she probably would have played with the keys more
if both of those were gone i would imagine she would have well when i first set her down in the middle she went straight for the pile of food
probably would have just spent her time picking those up and banging them together and -um picking up different ones passing them back and forth between her hands
does she bang other things together at home
we dont have blocks here sometimes moms will stack these does she have any blocks at home
no she doesnt not yet
yeah thats hard to pick up
yeah she just cant seem to get that very well yet
we read stories before her nap and bedtime so you know after playtimes done
i dont have the books out i guess at the same time as her toys
and then does she have any favorites that you look at home
she likes the ones that she can touch
thats i bought this out at first but she wasnt interested
she likes to be able to -um touch the feely books while we read them
okay lets see what would you say interested her the very least
-um today
the books
she wasnt interested in having me read to her she wanted to play
okay and at home do you think she prefers books or toys
-um probably toys
-um i mean we have like a set story time
story times during the day before each of her naps and at bedtime well read to her three books
but shes kinda settled down
but she smiles like when i you know get her changed and everything in her jammies and well get the books shell smile at them
so she likes to hear the stories she likes to likes to look at the pictures
-um i guess its part of the routine
right and she enjoys that
okay does she have any dolls at home
she has one doll we just got it for her like two days ago a little squishy baby doll
okay and how about any stuffed animals at home
we do have some but she really doesnt play with them a lot because she mostly wants to chew on them and they get all gross
right thats understandable
we dont have play food at home
not yet
not yet
not yet i think that might be all the questions
and i guess do you think there are any of the items here that you think that she would recognize the names of at this point
-um maybe baby
-um maybe book
thats probably maybe keys thats probably about it
okay thats great -uh thats all i needta ask
and so he can just keep playing
did you notice that he was interested in any set of toys
the food toys which is making me wonder if hes hungry
-um the peas
mostly the food toys
-um the peas the pizza the waffle
the waffle
the pasta
-um keys for a little while
and the stuffed animals seemed to hold him from the beginning but not
they didnt seem to to sustain him
okay -um
the food was mostly
seems to be his primary interest
okay do you guys have play food
we dont
which is kind of interesting
usually food is is food and and when he sees it its not necessarily in this form
unless well hes sees it on my husbands plate or my plate
like hell see pizza pieces or -um pasta
or peas
-um you know its kind of what we eat so
okay -um
which i kind of thought was interesting
-uh and this thing
yeah its weird looking
with the crazy hair so
i thought he would be more interested in pooh because we have a pooh at home it looks a little like this but
guess hes over pooh
we read books -uh
the only one that was was was good night moon
but we read -um
he didnt seemta to to go for the books today
i didnt think
and the lid to the bumbo
alright -um
theres always the lid to the bumbo
-um do you think hed recognize any of the animals in there
-um not really
not really i dont think so no
s we have a dog at home
and he didnt seem to gravitate towards any of those so particularly no
oh okay
-um so would you say he likes books or toys right now
-um im thinking hes more of a toy person at this stage
i read to him but hes you know
but th i think he see that as im about to go to bed
oh yeah
so i i probably needta to f adjust that a little bit so
like someones trying to give me to go to sleep
-um do you have dolls at home or anything
-uh weve got like stuffed things like this like theres a pooh his his vibrates
you know that kind of thing
we have -um stuffed animals but he doesnt really play with them theyre more of decoration for the room
hell grab at it an but he doesnt necessarily
play with them
play with them per se
he plays with -um
aw okay
he plays with little helicopters or
or or little like -um happy meal food
oh yeah
those ki of happy meal food toys
those kinds of toys
aw sweet pea
were almost done
i dont wanna keep him here
oh hell be alright
-um well he does usually play oh
-uh and he plays with his niece
and as long as shes on the floor with him
he tends to play a little bit longer than he does
-uh when hes alone or when hes -uh you know when he doesnt have her
oh okay
so -um s
aw sweetie pie
so not really -uh
hes starting to get sleepy
not really a sibling
but since they spend so much time together
shell be two in august
august seventeenth
so thats the one thing about about playing
-um and i mean its just you know its like helicopters and
i call them happy happy meal toys
but not really so much
he doesnt really seem to gravitate much to dolls
they dont do anything really
they just sit there
but hes got -uh
like a little s a push truck that plays music
and he he seems to like those
yeah aha
so so jingle balls and and those you know those those things that make a noise so any -um
-uh i think he gets in direct keys
and he likes things that arent toys
mm yeah
anything thats not a toy its th thats where we wanna go
like mommys makeup counter and c
facial cleanser and
wires yeah the wires
those are always fun
but thats you know
thats it
okay i think we are finished
this is colin powell
today is july twenty fourth and this is visit one
i just have a few questions for you
i just need a tissue real quick
oh okay
you like those keys huh baby
you want this key dont you
so which of these toys seemed to interest him the most
he likes
the cup
and the plate
and the keys the most
and why do you think that is
weve been practicing drinking from a cup
when im cooking or something at home
trying to keep him busy
i give him like a spoon or
some kitchen
plastic utensil to play with
something different to keep him
you know engaged
and then keys
i think just because they make a noise and he
hes into like shaking right now
-uh which of the toys seem to interest him the least
i think
the books
its okay
and why you think that is
maybe cause theyre hard and he likes
like textures
like grabbing and being able to
pick up stuff easily right now
and -uh
so i tried to show him a book
but he didnt
he liked the other stuff that he can hold
look at book at home
at all or
yes we do
is there any
does he have a favorite book or -uh
not really
he doesnt really
pay too much attention
i know hes listening when im reading
i read to him and his sister together
so i know hes listening
but hes not really
into like looking at it or
touching the book yet
so it could also be maybe
he sees enough at home like
you know he wants a new toy
i do not know
-um do you think he recognizes the names of any of these
i think so
spoons and the cup and plate -um
and the dog
we have a dog
what about some of the food
the food
probably not he just started eating
theres nothing that hes eaten
in here so
i dont think so ha
do you have any of these toys at home
we do we have books
we have stuffed animals
and do you ever play with pretend food
does his sister have any pretend food that
you guys play with
we play with
not pretend food
really its more like we pretend we have it in our hand like ah
ah but its not any of this play stuff
so we like
you wanna strawberry
and i give him one
and just like that
but not anything to actually hold
he seemed interested in the icecream and the
yeah he did
cause hes never
hes never had it haha
that i dont think hes seen
us or his sister
eat icecream
maybe just the shape
oh i guess these two
yeah the peas
-um does he play with dolls
dolls at home
his sister has lots of dolls so
he has
yeah he gets to play with dolls
i think
thats all we have
for you today
you did really good
you did
youre hungry huh
haha yeah
you need some real food
what first
oh man -um
i guess some of the food
the spoons we played with first
-um and then i guess we read a little bit of the goodnight moon book
and the she picked some more of the food
mostly she seemed to like the icecream cone
what did you play with after that
-um after the icecream cone
i gave her some other things
you liked that too
-um she had the spoon then she came over here
and she was playing a little bit like the plate and the spoon over here
oh i read her that book earlier too
and then
what like reading
oh this
which thing
the book
its d not this one
but she has like three other ones that are kinda similar so i read those to her
i just do peek a boo and stuff like that
-um and then
what else did we do lexie cbch
then she was rolling around a little bit
-um did you eat any other food over there
she played with the measuring spoons
and played with the clock a little bit
-um and i guess thats about it
she looked at mister brown can moo can you
which is something we read with her brother but
you eating your fingers silly girl bch
yeah bch
aw bch
-um there was one other food i saw that she was interested in
oh -um
the breakfast food
oh the waffle
i forgot that
so do you have pretend food at home
you know what
we have a little bit but she doesnt have it
she doesnt have it its in the basement
and she normally doesnt go down there
-um just because we only have like one chicken drumstick and thats it
maybe we should get you some fake food bch
what was she not interested in
-um she didnt really seem very interested in the stuffed animals
except for the frog
but she didnt really go for that and she didnt seem interested in the doll
does she have a doll at home
she actually does but her doll is more a stuffed animal than a doll
its a stuffed animal that looks like a doll
its soft and everything
what other books -um that were here -um did you own
-um we have the foot book
we have versions of this
we have good night moon
not the one two three but weve got the
we have books that are sort of like this that are you know tactile
or whatever you would call it
we dont have that one
but we have lots of books i mean i read to her everyday
oh you okay bch
are you okay bch
were all done thank you so much
okay great
thank you
alright lexie bch
enjoy your day
say bye toys well see you bch
alright -um
so basically i wanted to ask what you thought she enjoyed the most out of the toys here
i was looking at that because i figured you were gonna ask me that and the t som the toys that resemble food -um she kept migrating towards the cookie
and the pizza
and the icecream cone
and those things she kept
like this one she she didnt wanna put this down
-um until she picked up something else and then she kept going back to that one
and so i think she really
but we we like coldstone creamery
so we go and take her sister to get icecream and she likes icecream so maybe that is why shes migrating towards the icecream cone
but i noticed the pizza and the cookie
and but anything else i was trying to force it on her and the spaghetti too
-um she was messing with the spaghetti
the one that
she had one over here that looked a little bit more like spaghetti
but the ones that have the food
-um here we go
-um she wouldnt put these down
-um this one because of the the weird texture of this
which she loves keys
i think all babies do
-um but this one it moved on its own and it caught her eye
and she was like
i dont think i like that
and so then i moved it over here and she kept staring at it
and then she was like
okay i wanna touch it but i dont wanna touch it
so it was unknown to her and then like i would push it towards her and she showed fear
by moving away from it so i thought that was funny
and it was funny
-um because we have a kooshball
i do not know if you know what those are but theyre not as
right and so they move a little bit more freely too because they dont stick
and -um her sister is terrified of it
she wont touch it she wont pick up and i played an awful trick and threw it at her
and she laughed and picked it up
and she wasnt afraid of the kooshball
but this i think because of the texture -um not so much the color but the texture
shes drawn to it
well thats what i was gonna ask you next is why you thought she liked the certain things that she did like
some mothers think its color or texture
-um and its interesting that you observed what happened when she saw that move by itself
yeah because even still now the tentacles are letting go of each other
and -um you cant control that so when its sitting there and it does it its like
wait a minute why did that move i wanna touch that
how about these other stuffed animals
i just trying to get her to touch the stuffed animals and shed look at it but okay
p pooh -uh her nanna loves pooh so -um she looked at it a little bit but
-um so maybe because it was more familiar to her but the other stuffed animals no
she liked this one
she put this one in her mouth i think it was because of the stripes
the striped hat
and the duck you know i go to give her a kiss and
eh nothing
but the baby
she did like the baby
and she looked like she was trying to hug the baby
and i dont know if it was coincidence or not but she had the bottle in her hand
and -um so when i gave her the baby she put the baby down picked up the bottle
put the bottle down
it looked like she was trying to coordinate her hands to do whatever she wanted to do with the baby and the bottle
i dont think it was to feed it but i think she might associate the bottle with
now shes mainly breastfed -um and its i stay at home with her now im not -um im you know i took a year off from teaching to be with her
and so its very rare that she hasta be bottle-fed unless i have -um you know something i have to do when shes with my mother
or -uh her n my mother in law
so theyll occasionally use a bottle but shes skipping straight to the bottle and going to the cup
but she didnt wanna play with this one
do you think she would recognize that as something familiar
well yeah she shouldve because -uh but maybe not with the top because shes busy she doesnt want the top she wants
like you pick up a cup and she goes
i dont want the bottle
i dont want anything
i want your cup
i want what you have in your cup
so -um shes not but she put this in her mouth
she definitely knew what this was so
that looked familiar
and some of the food you think may look familiar too
well w ca -uh h her dad and -uh sister had pizza the other night
-um i do cook spaghetti so im not sure if -um its because its familiar
but she definitely keeps putting the food
nothing else really she was putting in her mouth
she didnt put the stuffed animals in her mouth
well she puts the keys in her mouth because thats what she does for everything all her play keys but
like nothing else you know most of the time when shes trying to figure something out she puts it in her mouth
but mainly if it was a food toy she put the food and the toy in her mouth
she didnt put the
well she tried to eat the baby
and she keeps going to
and i think because the baby looks like her
you know
im trying to get to know the baby
and was she interested in the books at all
no books
no even though i read with her sister everyday you kn
mommy can you read this to me
i wanna read to
and we -uh you know doing word recognition with her her sister
but shes not showing interest yet
yeah yeah i i picked this one up and
she wasnt really interested in it
i think she looked at it i think because of the colors
maybe the face on it but
but nothing else
-um she did i was when i said i i recognized id answered incorrectly
-um im not sure if i did or not but she actually picked the two up and was able to tap she tapped them together
and im not sure if i answered that correctly on the que on the
als ill look for it
yeah if shes able to tap them together
-um and and then as far as the names of some of these things like the food
do you think she would recognize names
hm maybe not
but i do you a you know whatever i do i always verbalize what im doing
im getting you a cup now
you know i want her to develop lang her sis sister developed speaking very early and -um
has none stop despite i think shh i think she has a stutter
-um im not sure
its because all kids do it at this age
trying to figure out what they wanna say
but with her -um im probably more sensitive to it because her father has a stutter
and so i
you know im just probably more on edge about it because
just give her some time
yeah when we have a very good friend whos a speech therapist
and -um he said dont worry about it until shes four
if shes still doing that and -um getting hung up on her like her and her her then -um address it
but for now dont even worry about it and she has a lisp
but its just with you know like snake
shes young
and she is young and when i say micah say and shell do it
she can do it
its just a matter of her being in such a hurry
right and shes probably useta do doing it the other way
mhm so im not g im not worried about it
but -um if qwynn does the same thing you cant
i think stuttering hasta be hereditary
well they know now that that thats at least a component of it
yeah it hasta be
because what are the odds
i just read in the paper about they identified some genes that -um are related to stuttering
still looking for some more but yeah but there are some genes that -um contribute to stuttering
so we know that at least thats one factor
and maybe it takes more than that to to really cause a person to stutter
yeah i dont know my husband had a blood clot when he was a a baby
and they actually sent him home to
told his mom to make his arrangements
for burial because he wasnt going to make it
and one of the most intellectual people i know today
you cant tell me that he was sposta die
you know
but thats just -um
and -uh they say thats where the stuttering came from
and i dont think so
i think if youre tw
because it happened to him when he was eighteen months or two years old something like that
but if youre that young you havent even developed the speech yet
so how do you know
you know
you you can say and
which you know
but how do you know that you werent going to stutter before the blood clot
you dont know and so i just listen
yeah i file it away
its one one battle im not gonna fight
but i know as a mother you know and and as a teacher
because i teach sixth sixth grade and i taught fifth for several years and ive come across my fair share of stuttering students
and -um it does not have to hinder their -um cognitive abilities or their learning or you know their participation in class
you know it doesnt have to be that way
as long as they feel they dont feel ashamed
yeah it shouldnt be any
but -um i think that -um if if it comes down to it shes definitely in the right place you know with you all i think
she is
and i put that on there so if you all come across any studies for micahs age group that would be great too
you know just give us a call
well gladly bring her in
and if you do become concerned about like when shes four
you you have your friend so thats a resource
and if you ever wanted to get her evaluated here at the clinic they do that here too
so -um you can just make an appointment and have her evaluated
we actually have -um on the faculty here one of the i mean most well known people who work with stutterers
-um and so she would be part of that evaluation
that would be good to know
thats good to know
yeah shes great yeah they have two -um fluency groups that meet here that are adults -um stutterers
so theres a pretty strong
actually -um her background is in fluency too
so so thats a very strong piece of the department here
so yeah but your daughters young and but if you ever did wanna have her evaluated that you could come here
mhm yeah
yeah i will ill keep that in mind
use your friend
well charles is excellent
he he works at howard university too so hes
yeah so there they probably have
yeah theyre not as extensive as maryland i would imagine but -um
yeah so you know what to do
oh yeah oh yeah
now as far as qwynn -um we have a lot of
we have a lot of information that you -um provided and were gonna ask you ea at each visit to fill out
and i know that a lot of it is gonna be the same but she will change over time so -um youll see that
oh yeah shell grow and develop
each time we have a play session its gonna be these toys so well see if
if her interests change
mhm if her interests change if the way she explains the toys change
anything like that so itll be just like this
and -um
and its over the course of four visits so that means shell be
shell be
this is the seven month visit then well do around ten months around eleven months and then at two years
and the two year visit is a little different
there will be a play session but theyll be some -um some evaluations and assessments and then well be able to give you some information on her that way when shes two
thatll be fun
yeah it is and to see the the change and the progression
alright well we are all done and i can take your microphone
seemed to interest him the most
do you think
i think he was a fan of the peas
and the keys
haha the peas and the keys
and why do you think
and actually the plush toys too
im surprised that he wasnt interested in the books
because at home he loves his books
oh why
but he has specific
im sorry what were you gonna ask
no i was just gonna ask like why do you think he was more like interested in those
i dont know
i mean clearly the keys hes interested in because he can chew on them
and hes teething
so anything he can chew on right now
and they make noise
when he shakes them
not really sure about the peas
thats my guess
and he also was going after the plush things more than he does at home
because he has lots of stuffed animals that he generally ignores and goes more for the books at home
so who knows
do you think probably because these stuffed animals are like new to him maybe
they might be
and those are the ones that we read over and over
because none of these were
i actually thought hed love this one because we have where is babys belly button
but maybe since these were different he wasnt as drawn to them
oh okay
but these being different were apparently interesting to him so
out of all the stuffed animals which one do you think he had most interest with
-um what was the first one
that chicken
where is it
here yeah
haha is this a funny chicken
dont gag yourself mister
so out of all the toys which one would you say he liked the least
oh the least
all the toys that are here
or all the toys that he played with
all the toys that are here
because i mean some of them he didnt even look at
he seemed really indifferent to the baby doll
what did you like the least jack
do you feel like he played with a lot of the foods
i was gonna say the food stuff he wasnt that interested in
i mean with the exception of the peas
probably the food stuff in general he was least interested in
do you think if you said any of the names of the items would he recognize them
not at this point
i dont think so no
i mean
if you said like peas would he know thats peas
cookies is cookies
the only thing he would probably know is if there was
well i actually just noticed this
like he might recognize this because he has a cup
that he drinks water from
but i would be
no i dont think he would recognize the names of the other foods
okay and do you have any toys like this at home other than like just the stuffed animals and books
-um stuffed animals and books
we dont have any of this kind of food stuff no
okay and you were reading that book to him
do you see if there were any items that really interest him in that one
in this one
i mean its the flaps
the flaps
like which flaps did he like
-um i think he liked the ones that were
like he liked the umbrella
he had trouble with -um the curtains
he liked this one the ball
hes a big fan of balls
thats why i was trying to make this into a ball type object
because he seems to really
be a fan of balls lately
yeah i would say the ball in here and the umbrella
were the two flaps he liked
okay would you overall say that hes interested in books or toys
id say that he has a runny nose
here or at home
and at home you would say books
its hard to tell
i would say its probably much more equal at home
and have you ever played pretend food at home
we havent
you havent
you like to watch mommy and daddy cook
with real food
and we explain real food to you
but we dont have plastic food
so do you think hell recognize any of the foods at home
-um outside of dog food
probably not yet at this point
i mean he watches us
and hes very interested in what were doing
but i dont know that theres recognition yet between you know
and flour
and chicken and that kind of stuff
okay and im assuming he probably doesnt play with any dolls at home
-um well i mean we dont have any just because hes the first
-um but i will say that we were at friends house a few weeks ago
and she has a son and a daughter
and they got lots of trucks and lots of dolls
and we dont have either
we dont have trucks for him yet or dolls
and he was very interested in the trucks so
okay well thats good
we have st lots of stuffed animals
but we dont have baby dolls yet do we
no we dont
okay and that is it
you love
you love these keys
reach them
you can stop now
he can keep playing if he wants
while we we chat
he gets really angry when i take things away from him
thats okay
that we really wants like paper and the remote control
so which toys do you think he was most interested in
-um toys that make sounds
and toys that he could put in his mouth
okay why do you think that he likes those
-um because hes pretty active and he likes to clang things around
so shake his arm and throw things
so thats just been my observation thats what he gravitates to normally
an that and things that he isnt allowed to have
okay which ones do you think he was least interested in
-um he wasnt really interested in what i was doing with the food
-um did you look at any of the books we had
which ones
-um we were reading mister brown can moo can you
and do you have any of these at home
yeah -um we have that one at home
we havent looked at it in a few months though
i dont actually know where it is right now
do you think in general he prefers books or toys
i think it depends
he likes to play with the books
like we try to read him -um books every night as part of our going to bed routine
and he always is trying to grab them and play with them instead of reading for the most part
-um so i guess it just
he kind of alternates between playing with the toys
like if we were at home and he had the option he would kind of take one and then the other
its not like i think he exclusively prefers one or the other
-um do you have a babydoll at home or
-um we have more stuffed animals
-um we dont have a babydoll like that
yeah so thats kind of the first time i think hes seen a doll like that
-um and do you think he would recognize the names of any of these items
-um books
book definitely
-um i dont know
probably not anything else actually
-uh sippycup maybe
weve just started using that
-um recently
so maybe book and sippycup
and any of the animals
-um maybe bumblebee
maybe winnie the pooh
maybe the rooster
-um do you have similar toys at home or do you have
-um -uh the stuffed animals that we have like i dont -um generally give to him to play with
-um we dont have any of the food
we have little rattles and things
-um we have the books
thats about it
are there other toys at home that he likes to play with that we dont have here
-um yeah -um he likes -um things that have -um crinkly cellophane in them
he has some like teething toys that are like stuffed with plastic parts and things
and he has little trucks like fisher price dump truck kinda thing that he likes
and theres a toy called a whoozit
-um its black and white on one side and the other side has a little face on it
youre just into it arent you bch
is there anything else you think we should know about his play skills things we didnt see here or is this typical of how he plays
-um yeah like he likes shaking things that make noise he likes
doing that when hes really excited
is there anything else that you think we should know
i dont think so
well were all done then
you sure
but i do wanna talk to you a few minutes about it
you wanna come out for that
okay youre out
dont worry
i think
there we go okay
okay hold on
there youre okay
oh isabel
oh my goodness
there shh
wanna crawl around
oh youre okay
that was a pretty quick turn around
get a distraction in there
so -um are any of these toys ones that you actually have at home
that shes particulary familiar with already or
-um the food
-um you want in particular
in general
-uh like the peas
we have these the same exact peas at home
-um some of the plates
i do not know if shell go after those
i take it theyre for
she has an older sister
and then she has some stuffed animals
although she has lots of stuffed animals
i dont think shes ever played with a baby doll before
and then you know we read her books
but nothing
isabel not in your mouth
but not -um
we clean them after each baby so
okay well thats not too bad then
-um i dont think we have these exact books
but -um
you commented that good night moon was the new one
i havent seen the number good night moon before
we have the original
does she actually play with the food items
or is it mostly just that her sister does and theyre in the house
no shell play with them
but she just kind of handles them
and looks at them and
goes on to the next
are there particular toys that you think match her personality better
that she tends to go for or tends to be more interested in as a general class
-um ones that light up and play music
those seem to get her attention the most
or anything she can put in her mouth
thats pretty
why did you pick the particular stuffed animals that you did out of all of them
yo you were
the brighter colored ones
you know especially with the hair
here with the different material
that would get her attention a little more
but definitely the brighter colors
but you picked the chicken
the chicken
yeah well then i started going with the animal sounds
thinking that she might enjoy or
its harder to really teach her anything at this point but
get them started early with the animal sounds
are there particular games you tend to play with her
this is one of them
-um i think thats the only game i can think of that we play with her
and we tickle her
-um but yeah i think probably peekaboo is the only that she can really identify with
or no the clock actually
she didnt have any interest in the clock
you mentioned frio is frio a
oh yeah its my parents poodle
she sees frio probably a few times a week
but its a black poodle
does it have the
i she probably couldnt identify with that
-um in general does she tend to prefer books or toys
id say toys for sure
i mean with books she wants to put them in her mouth
is there a favorite book that you actually tend to read her a lot of the ones at home
or is it just whatever
no its probably whatever were reading to her sister
is what shes gonna to be listening to
maybe a little more advanced
yeah if only that was real
yes if only
-um anything in particular that you think i should be asking and im not
about what things she likes and what things she doesnt
or anything else you can tell me
about like playing habits
yes just playing habits
i think you know having an older sister really gears her
you know her sister gears her more towards what theyre going to be playing with
you know shell pick up isabel and put her in front of the kitchen
or put her in front of her stuffed animals
and just start showing her things
so i think thats -um that probably gears her more -um for her playing habits
and i dont know i mean this is pretty typical just like kinda putting her in front of a bunch of toys and kinda letting her have at it
-um yeah and everything goes in her mouth
at this age that is very difficult
everything goes in
-um she has a piano at home
like a little baby piano that she loves to bang on
-um seems the other toys that she likes are the bouncy seat
she can jump up and down in that
and yeah anything that lights up and plays music
and she also likes to stand
-um like we have a little play table
or stand and hold on to yeah
to keep her balance
she really likes to do that
but -um yeah theres nothing else
other than that
thats pretty much all of her her playing habits
well thats all i have for you
when she gets a little older were going to come back and do this again
at which point one of the questions will be things like what has changed
like if she suddenly got some more interests or
yeah hopefully
but at some point shell
like some kids are just really into stuffed animals
things i can put in my mouth and some kids are
so heres
let me take that from you
here you go

isnt it madam
so lots of boxes and noisy things like that for christmas then is it nac
hm nac
not sure about that nac
auntie isabelle was saying that she was going to buy a xylophone and a drum and a tambourine nac
then she nac
its because she hates us nac

its its actually its the smallest of the toot ranges nac
erh um and it it was really cheap nac
erh it was an absolute pain getting it back to the hotel but it fit really well in our suitcase so that was fine nac

so shes got that and shes got a few other bits and pieces nac
ive gotta decide which ones are gonna go from father christmas and which ones are gonna go from nac
mummy and dad nac
mummy and daddy nac
but i didnt want to buy her too much because its not like shes gonna remember or particularly care nac
i imagine nac

yeah and the only other thing ive bought her that im really quite excited about is this scuttlebug nac
okay nac
its like a little fold up scooter thing which is quite cool nac
well not scooter its she sits on it so nac
well you kind of scoot along on it though nac
but nac
okay nac
but now that her legs are beginning to go then i thought that that would be quite good nac
but i got that from costco here because it was on offer the other week so it was like thirteen or fourteen pounds nac
it was great it was like awesome nac

the other problem is that all childrens toys cost at least ten pounds apparently nac

mmm lovely lovely thirst quenching water
i do find you funny
i do find you funny
youre a funny bunny
num num num num num num
num num num num
while you have your sandwich shall i read you a story
weve got a lovely story called “the super sandwich”
let us see if i can find it
oh dear
here it is
heres “the super sandwich”
going to read this to you while you have your lunch
its illustrated by catherine vaser
with a funny little thing above the
i think thats what that means
its got four felt fillings wo
lets make a sandwich with fantastic fillings rdg
im putting in something from my pot rdg
my favorite spaghetti nice and hot rdg
look heres some spaghetti
sandwich with spaghetti in
thats a bit strange
what do you want to put in the sandwich lion rdg
ooh lions having a little think rdg
fresh from my garden small and neat a handful of peas so fresh and sweet rdg
ooh they do look sweet
what do you want to put in the sandwich monkey rdg
whats monkey got here
sticky jam thickly spread thats what i like on my bread rdg
look hes got lots of jars of jam
these ones have cherries on so i guess theyre cherry jam
these ones have got strawberries on
hes got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen jars of jam
and heres the jam here to put on
its all got little seeds all over it
what do you want to put in the sandwich mouse rdg
ooh mouse has got a little clue here
hes holding a knife thats got a little bit of a dent at the end
it looks like a cheese knife to me
although it might be quite a squeeze there must be room for a slice of cheese rdg
this sandwich has spaghetti on the bottom and then a slice of bread and then there are peas and another slice of bread and then jam and another slice of bread and then a slice of cheese wow and another slice of bread rdg
five slices of bread crikey
weve cut it in four its time to eat it rdg
we think its delicious and nothing can beat it rdg
what a funny sandwich containing spaghetti peas jam and cheese
your sandwich has just got plain old cream cheese
no spaghetti
no peas no jam just cream cheese
you like it just the same
is that what you just told me
mm youre a hungry horse
youre a hungry horse
now weve got some very exciting news hannah daddy has got the weekend off
so we can do lots of lovely things cant we
yes we can
what could we do this weekend
maybe we could go to gorgie farm
is that what youd like to do
go and see some pigs
perhaps we could go and visit grandma
do you want to go visit grandma
and gran
no not so keen on that idea
well i think we might anyway
we could go for a nice walk up the hill if the weather stays like this
its a beautiful bright day isnt it
lovely and cold and blustery but sunny
we could take maisy out to practise riding her bike
getting very good
the next size up for you both
its a bit of a boring job though
hu oh what else could we do
we could hm do you know i cant think
i cant think what we could do
im sure there must be lots of things
maybe theyll be a nice bonfire display on this weekend
go and see some fireworks
maybe youre a bit little for that
think maisy would like them
what could we do for you
that you would like to do
you would just like to roll around though wouldnt you and practise standing up
i think so
i think so
youre just demolishing this sandwich
it must be absolutely delicious
jelly on a plate wibble wobble jelly on a plate sng
sweeties in a jar shake them up sweeties in a jar sng
candles on a cake blow them out candles on a cake sng
fire on the floor stamp it out fire on a floor sng
eensy-weensy spider climbed up the water spout sng
down came the rain and washed the spider out sng

you will
be all nice and clean

you care far more than i ever do
i just want to be comfy
comfy comfy comfy
is that what you want to be a comfy boy
cant say i blame you
who wouldnt
hello peekaboo
right lets see what lurks within
got your indoor kinda kind of dungarees
theyre really cosy
actually weve not had those out for a while
little size check i think daniel
yeah because you just seem to grow so quickly
i know
woohoo its a nine to twelve situation daniel its a result
do you fancy giving those a go
yeah i think theyd be lovely and soft if we get down to soft play
ah i do
need to reorganize your drawers daniel because theres stuff here that we just never get round to looking at
the terrible waste
i know
are you just a smiley boy
well indeed
the only problem with those daniel is that they might not be very warm if we walk
shall we have a look and see what this weathers doing
shall we open the blind
are you you ready
are you you steady
up it goes
ooh now looking promising for a little walk
looking promising daniel
now the good news about a walk
is its nice fresh air and theyll be lots to see
the bad news is i think we want super cosy trousers because its probably not that warm out there really
super cosy breeches
what do you think
lets have a change of heart then and find some super cosy ones
sound good
so but we must not forget about those for another day
you remind me okay
now these look pretty cosy daniel
mummy whatever
is that what youre thinking
really mummy when will you ever learn
i am at best ambivalent
daniel youve put your toes in the air
those toes are in the air
whatre they doing up there
are they
are they looking up at the sky
youre quite happy in there arent you
do you know while youre quite happy i might do a little bit of tidying up in here
would that be good
say mummy i care about as much about that as i do about what im wearing
panic yay not young daniel i was not leaving
just popping outside to get some of the things we need to tidy up
i know
and thats what we needed
thats what we needed
getting the job done huh
back again
sweetheart there is no need to panic
oh separation anxiety is a terrible affliction
look here we are
back again
back again
is that all better
are you ready to get up
shall we get you up sweetheart
come on then
ready steady and up

free and easy aye
i i think yeah i think emptying that box is probably a really good idea

yeah i dont know what nurseys doing in it anyway
because thats a fruit and veg box isnt it
carrots and apples and onions and a nurse
she doesnt belong there
she doesnt belong there
thats it you pull her out
oh youre gonna going to try that on her head are you

can you put them into the box
can you put them into the box
banana flavored or brick flavored
i see what youre trying to do

what about
what about this one
this is a long book
long ago in a faraway land
lived a poor orphan named aladin
one day in the market aladin took some bread
the sultans guard chased him but aladin and his pet monkey abu escaped
then aladin saw two hungry children and gave the bread to them
things will change
he told abu
someday well live in a palace
that afternoon the sultan told princess jasmine she was to marry a prince in three days
i will marry only for love
she cried
jasmine disguised herself and ran away
in the market she took an apple but couldnt pay the angry fruit seller
aladin rescued her
the merchant called the guard
they released the princess but took aladin to the palace dungeon
meanwhile jafar the sultanss evil counselor disguised himself as a prisoner
help me find a very special lamp
he said to aladin
and ill set you free
god bless you
jafar took aladin and abu to the cave of wonders
touch nothing but the lamp
he said
a magic carpet appeared and led aladin to the lamp
aladin reached for it
abu grabbed a ruby
the cave began to collapse
the magic carpet saved aladin and abu
but all three were trapped
whats so special about this old lamp
aladin wondered aloud
as aladin rubbed the dust off an enormous genie appeared
he said
i can grant you three wishes
now lets get out of here
aladins first wish was to become a prince
so jasmine would marry him
he promised to use his third wish to set the genie free
later that day aladin arrived at the palace in grand style
im prince ali
he told the sultan
that evening prince ali took jasmine for a ride on his wonderful carpet
soon she became suspicious
arent you the boy from the market
she asked
no i really am prince ali
he said
then the magic carpet took them back to the palace
that was wonderful
she said
sighed jasmine
she had fallen in love
things are finally going right
aladin happily told abu
but again jafar had ordered the guards to get rid of aladin
after the guards tossed aladin into the sea
he summoned the genie and used his second wish to save his own life
aladin returned to the palace with the lamp
but iago jafars parrot stole it
so jafar became the genies master
make me sultan
jafar commanded
make jasmine and her father my slave
the genie was forced to obey
jafar used his second wish to become a powerful sorcerer
changed aladin back into a beggar and sent him far away
the magic carpet helped aladin return to the palace
jafar was furious that aladin found a way to trick him
the genie still has more power than youll ever have
he said
it worked
jafar used his third wish to become a genie
but he forgot one thing
every genie must live in a lamp and so jafar disappeared
the sultan decided to let jasmine choose her own husband
i choose you
she told aladin
aladins dream had come true
but he didnt forget his third wish
he said
genie youre free forever
the end
you say
oh no not another “the end”
books have a “the end”
and when its the end there is no more
you can only just start them over again

whats that
my very first winnie the pooh
poohs neighborhood
lets see
i say
its a splendid day in the neighborhood
said owl
its a nice day here too
said winnie the pooh
exactly what im saying
said owl
a perfectly splendid day in the neighborhood
which neighborhood are we talking about
asked pooh
said owl
our neighborhood
the place where we live and our neighbors live and are neighborly
said pooh
isnt it
said owl
now im off for an owls eye view
he flew up and circled once around poohs house
what does it look like from up there
called pooh
i can see the hundred acre woods spread out below me
said owl
and its a fine place indeed
as owl flew off
pooh began to think about what it means to live in a neighborhood
he thought perhaps he would take a neighborly present to his closest neighbor piglet
he took a honey pot out of his cupboard and tied a nice blue ribbon around it
then he tucked it comfortably under his arm and stomped down the path towards piglets
but when he reached his thoughtful spot
which is halfway between his house and piglets
pooh suddenly had a thought
i could take this path straight to piglets house
i could go up the path and around the whole neighborhood
and sooner or later the path would take me to piglets house anyway
and that is what he did
after he had walked for a time
he came to the house where kanga and roo lived
hello kanga
said pooh
im just on my way to deliver this neighborly present to piglet
but pooh dear
piglet lives that way
said kanga pointing down the very path by which pooh had come
said pooh
but today im going the long way
oh i see
said kanga
in that case
perhaps you should join us for a snack
come on pooh
cried roo
were going to the picnic spot
pooh said he was feeling a bit eleven oclock
so they all went together past the sandy pit where roo plays
up to the picnic spot to share a little something
half an hour and one picnic basket later
pooh thanked kanga
tucked piglets honey pot back under his arm
and stomped down the path towards rabbits house
come back

june twenty seventh
once i watched a turtle
its called the traveler
once i watched a turtle who wasnt watching me
bumbling in his turtle shell clumsily bobbing his turtle head to and fro
going on his turtle legs
going slow
snapping at a buzzing fly
snap swallow wink
turning toward a shallow pool
wants a drink
bumbling bobbling stop and go
once i watched a turtle
and now i know there are lots more things to see when you go slow
thats pretty cool
although daddy probably wouldnt like it that theres a turtle poem on his birthday because hes not a turtle
