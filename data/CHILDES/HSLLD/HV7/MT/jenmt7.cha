@Comment:	This mealtime lasts for 8:26 and includes Mot , FAT , Chi and her two younger brothers , BRO and BR2. BR2 has not begun to talk yet , but provides a lot of background noise throughout the length of the tape. Chi talks quite a bit , at first about who she babysat the night before , and then about the movie she saw at the same time , The Santa Clause. Bro interjects about the movie as well. Fat seems to be taking care of BR2 and is somewhat involved , although the main conversation is dominated by Chi and Mot.
