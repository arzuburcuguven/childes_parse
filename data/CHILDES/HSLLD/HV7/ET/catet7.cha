@Comment:	MOT and Chi work together well. Mot directs the activities by making suggestions and Chi usually follows them. There is almost no science talk except for a moment when Chi's brother is present. There are other voices in the background. The phone rings at one point and part of the telephone conversation is audible. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
