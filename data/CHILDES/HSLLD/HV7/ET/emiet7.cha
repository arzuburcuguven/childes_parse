@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	20-NOV-1993
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	the last [!] thing we have you guys do together (.) is +...
@Comment:	The interaction between Chi and Mot is highly confrontational. Several times Mot knocks down Chi's constructions , so that Chi never gets to complete her creations. Chi works on her own , and explicitly refuses to follow Mot's ideas , for which Mot scolds her several times. At one point , Chi explicitly states that she and Mot are not playing together. Sometimes the confrontational interaction is playful. Chi does experiment with many of the objects to see if they are magnetic or not , and there is some brief explicit talk about whether or not an object will magnetify. Chi's Fat is off camera during the entire activity , but he makes comments now and then.
@Comment:	Time is 24:31. Videotape does not start until later; interaction until that point is from audiotape only
