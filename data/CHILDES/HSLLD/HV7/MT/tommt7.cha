@Comment:	MT lasts about 27.5 minutes. Chi mumbles a lot and is sometimes hard to understand. The conversation is full of different topics (and rich vocabulary) , and Mot and Chi are equal participants. Custody arrangements with Chi's father alluded to. I like Mot's interaction with Chi; she explains things well , but isn't talking down to Chi. Mot mentions quizzing Chi on spelling words but they don't do it on tape.
