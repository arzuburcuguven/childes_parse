*PAR1:	okay . 2127105_2127385
*PAR1:	how about a robot . 2127565_2128505
*PAR1:	how about a robot to cut the lawn . 2129205_2130785
*PAR1:	&-um a lawnmower . 2132005_2133145
*PAR1:	robot . 2133145_2133465

*PAR12:	what he run over the cat . 2136735_2137885
*PAR1:	he'd have to have a sensor . 2138765_2139575
*PAR1:	oh he would be a great robot . 2139995_2141735
*PAR1:	a lawnmower robot would have to have a sensor . 2142215_2144135
*PAR1:	so he wouldn't run over the cat . 2144995_2146135
*PAR1:	he had to have eyes . 2146155_2146975
*PAR1:	he'd have to be able to <he'd be able> [/] he'd be able to stop and dig weed . 2147725_2151295
*PAR1:	when he detected the weed . 2151445_2152495
*PAR1:	he'd stop he'd dig into the weed . 2152965_2155095
*PAR1:	pull it off . 2155325_2156215
*PAR1:	and he would also be able to &-uh descend &-uh you know &-uh fertilize the lawn with powder . 2156715_2162135
*PAR1:	he'd <have a> [/] have a bin for powdered fertilizer . 2162485_2164695
*PAR1:	yeah . 2164725_2165015
*PAR12:	I've got a I've got an idea . 2165325_2166655

*PAR2:	too . 2183015_2183175
*PAR2:	there's a guy at and made one . 2183175_2186215
*PAR2:	he went . 2186235_2186615
*PAR12:	feeds the cat . 2186745_2187375
*PAR2:	and pets it gate went there . 2187375_2188415
*PAR1:	so what you can do your own . 2188475_2189295
*PAR12:	well [/] well what about the [/] the robot <that goes to Mrs Scott's> [/] that goes to Mrs Scott's yeah . 2189885_2197095
*PAR12:	mailbox . 2197245_2197735

*PAR12:	yeah . 2200605_2200895
*PAR12:	but I know you understand the task . 2201035_2202655
*PAR12:	you know the task . 2202795_2203575
*PAR12:	you can program this robot to open it to do the very thing that you know how to do . 2204875_2209775
*PAR2:	that I had one something for your lawnmower . 2210445_2212975
*PAR2:	robot . 2212985_2213335

*PAR1:	for feelers [/] feelers [/] feelers he'd have to have feelers in case he [/] he come came too close with . 2220775_2224455
*PAR2:	somebody he'd like . 2224615_2225215
*PAR2:	if he ran into a wall . 2225215_2226415
*PAR1:	he wouldn't work with eyes . 2227435_2228655
*PAR1:	he'd worked with [/] with sensory . 2228805_2229975
*PAR1:	yeah touch . 2230045_2230655
*PAR1:	he'd be a touch robot . 2230805_2231935
*PAR1:	so everything would be if he came to close with something . 2232275_2234375
*PAR2:	like robot . 2234375_2235095
*PAR2:	he'd be blind a blind robot . 2235245_2236615
*PAR2:	yeah . 2236725_2237015
*PAR1:	but if he wouldn't use visual . 2237015_2238055

*PAR1:	turn you know exactly on like wonder . 2269935_2272265
*PAR1:	but I think what we need is a general purpose robot . 2272525_2274465
*PAR1:	and then we can with a computer . 2274465_2275825
*PAR1:	and then <we can> [/] we can program him to do . 2275925_2277865
