thats how to add
this is add a scale
no no thats not time see
get all your numbers then you add add two
two and one are
see how it goes
alright but what makes four

you have to find out what what would make seven
see how it goes down
you have to get it so that itll stay on top
you got a two and a one over here
see you have to put five
see there
thats five
yeah put the two up first
two and five
that add up to seven
see look
whoop five fell off
see five and two are seven
oh well if you wanna put that one on first
ill call grampy
what are you doing
there it balances because seven and two are nine
you can find out how much seven is
seven is
will it
you can put it on the other side
so so what does that mean if it balances
see if it works
hey you got that clay all over you
she got a clay set
they were playing with it last night
she got it all over her
you should have seen her face
does it balance
that means what
it means three and three are six

three and what
now put a three on

the good day bunnies tooth fairy
good day said papa to everyone at the breakfast table
papa had worked most of the night at the carrot juice factory
how is everyone this morning
bumper looked up from his cereal and said im good papa
no huh here go get a juice
get up and act like a little lady
come here
you ready
becky bumpers twin stopped chewing her toast long enough to say im good too
baby bonnie lifted her arm
she wanted to get out of her high chair and sit on her daddys lap
picked her up for a minute and then put her back in her own seat
bumper eat your toast grandma said
but i cant bite into it answered bumper
my tooth is loose
it is not yelled becky
youre making it up
i know you are because were twins and my tooth is not loose
its loose bumper insisted look at it move
bumper wiggled his front tooth for everyone to see
yuck said becky
well what does a little child with a loose tooth eat for breakfast asked momma
whats soft enough
ice cream answered bumper immediately
you cant have ice cream for breakfast said momma
how about an egg
no egg said bumper ill eat my toast
bumper took a big bite and guess what
bumpers loose tooth came out
what should i do now bumper asked
grandma answered first
you should take your tooth out of your toast papa added
go to the sink and rinse out your mouth and you can also wash off the tooth
but be careful not to wash it down the drain
after he rinsed bumper put his tongue where his tooth useta be
then he announced i have a hole in my mouth
dont worry about it said momma
the hole will soon fill out with another tooth even bigger and stronger than the one you just lost
momma kissed bumper
grandma kissed bumper
papa kissed bumper
they all smiled and told him losing his first tooth was something to feel real good about
becky was upset
everyone was making a big fuss over bumper
bumper would probably get something from the tooth fairy and there would be nothing for her
becky ran out of the kitchen even before she was excused
bumper ran after becky
he wanted to show her his tooth and then he wanted to put it under his pillow before it was time to leave for school
becky he shouted
dont be mad your tooth will fall out soon
becky didnt answer she just picked up her school bag and headed for the door
soon grandma called from downstairs lets go twins the bus is here
becky and bumper hurried outside momma followed
she was on her way to work
good bye momma said have a good day
i will said bumper i wont thought thought becky
now the house was quiet
papa went to his bedroom for a nap
what shall we do today grandma asked bonnie
bonnie walked over to the kitchen counter she pointed to the mixing bowls
bonnie wanted grandma to bake cookies and she wanted to help her
grandma put everything on the kitchen table flour sugar eggs and butter bowls and beaters spoons and spatulas
bonnie sifted and bonnie stirred bonnie poured and bonnie mixed
grandma dropped the batter onto the cookie sheet one spoonful at a time
when the cookies were just right grandma took them out of the oven and put them on a plate to cool
then she said its time for your nap bonnie
now it was grandmas time for grandma to do whatever pleased her
she went to the living room to practice the violin
grandma was a good fiddler she liked to make pretty music
playing made her feel good inside
grandma played slow songs then some fast ones
she tapped her foot to keep the rhythm
grandmas feet danced as she played
before grandma knew it bonnie was calling
grandma took bonnie out of her crib
what about this one
lets go downstairs and see if our cookies are ready for becky and bumper grandma said to bonnie as she took her by the hand
bumper and becky were coming up the back path by the time grandma and bonnie got downstairs
they came inside dropped their school bags in the hall and headed for the kitchen
they found the cookies already on the kitchen table
here said bonnie giving each of them one cookie
who made these↑ bumper asked
bonnie grinned from ear to ear
me she shouted
wow they look good said bumper
becky and bumper sat down for glasses of milk
becky bit hard into her cookie hoping her tooth would fall out just like bumpers but it didnt even though becky bit and chewed as hard as she could
go get her pacifier
do you believe in the tooth fairy↑ bumper asked
yep becky answered
i believe if you leave your tooth in an envelope under your pillow someone will come take the tooth and leave a present instead
what kind of present
i think tooth fairies leave whatever they want but mostly its money said becky
how much do you think a quarter but youll probably only get a nickel
youre mean answered bumper im going up stairs to check under my pillow
becky ran up the stairs bec bumper ran up the stairs becky followed close behind
bumper ran right to his bed and shouted the tooth fairys been here and she left an envelope under my pillow
bumper tore open the lumpy envelope and smiled as he read the message
loose tooth wiggly tooth a bite of toast and the tooth falls out
want me to hit you
real hard
here is a shiny new quarter for me hope this has been a good day love the tooth fairy
i though you would wanna save your tooth for a while so i returned it to you
becky was sitting on her bed looking miserable but something made her check under her pillow
theres an envelope under my pillow too she yelled across the room and its lumpy
becky ripped open the envelope and inside she found a letter and a shiny new quarter
what did the tooth fairy tell you bumper asked
and not one minute sooner
becky read your tooth will come out when its ready and not one minute sooner in the mean time make every day a good day

whats up
-um kind of spreads the light out a little bit
what have you gotta drink there
its season again
thats an old commercial
that useta be an old commercial
i dont know if youve seen it even once
its steamy right in the middle
let it cool a little bit
what mommas doing is a play on word
okay wait
see all the steam
just wait one minute and let the steam come out of it
mm probably not
well if you wanna start eating it
you should start around the edges
ill take that out of your way
theres garlic bread too
you want a piece of garlic bread
this is steaming too
everythings steaming
well what do you supposed emmys sister doing for supper tonight
i dont know
could be
shell probably stay out late tonight
shell be dragging around tomorrow
what time is she sposta come home tomorrow
you told her the middle of the day
hows the lasagna
there you are
so what gave you the idea for lasagna
watching garfield this morning
you watched him scarf it down
he has some unusual diets
he had a sit on it diet
he could eat what ever he could sit on
so most people would wouldnt mind sitting on lettuce
so if you could sit on it you could eat it
mm it would become a pancake if you
cut the garlic bread please
you could sit on a sponge cake
but it would be difficult to sit on an upside down cake
its top would be on its bottom
mm this is good
cake out of your hair
having cake at your school
on a school day
oh i see
that would look kind of strange
but just think
you could always have it there for a snack if you got hungry
maybe if i have time tomorrow ill make a cake
what kind of cake would you make
you went to the store today
did you talk her into buying it when you were at the store
no she was pretty good
she only talked me into one thing
whats that
chocolate middle cookies
well thats acceptable
and we got ice cream sandwiches
oh you didnt remind me
we have enough icecream
we have to use up what weve got before we buy strawberry
we have vanilla and chocolate and something else
chocolate chip
its a good day
i never expected it to be seventy degrees today
i hope its going to be nice tomorrow
its still april
this is the kind of the weather you have in june if your lucky
well we can do that again this summer too
but we gotta
is getting pretty small
actually it isnt the pool thats getting smaller its you thats getting bigger
theres two things for the grocery cart seat
oh the grocery cart
big pretty soon youll be big enough to drive to the store and buy the groceries for us
well about thirteen or fourteen years
in fourteen years
in fourteen years youll be seventeen
and youll youll have your drivers license and go grocery shopping
in fourteen years shell be nineteen
oh right im sorry
only twelve years and youll be seventeen
supposed emmy will go grocery shopping for us when she gets her license
maybe just so she can
i dont know
that would be the only reason shed offer
well we hope she doesnt crash either
you did a great job
wait what
you get some of the sauce
well you dont have any trouble eating now that your tooth finally fell out huh
you got a big hole and youre chomping right into it
are any of the other kids in your classroom losing their teeth
katie lost teeth
those are the first ones to go i bet
your bottom ones are coming in pretty good
let me see
theyre coming up pretty good
a what in your mouth
a big living room for your tongue
well that was worth seconds
well having lasagna is a good thing to have when emmys not here because she doesnt like it huh
get out of my seat
come on
he thinks hes like garfield
yeah he wants lasagne
he probably wouldnt eat it
licks up spaghetti sauce
doesnt he
hes feisty later when its getting dark
you have the candles
oh and moonlight
its the weekend
you can stay up
most people do
two times
how come two times
whats that
well micky came down to play most of the day today with you huh
any any of the other kids around
are any of the other kids around
rachel or nicole
yeah i know that
i remember that
mm you and jason get along today
how come
you fooled him huh
no i know
its too bad you cant play with those boys who live next door here
well sometimes you guys get along but sometimes you dont
you seem to get along okay once you go down to his house and start playing nintendo
he can get kind of bossy
he wants to take your turn just so hell get be able to play
oh my gosh
youre having thirds
actually im going to have thirds too
well i didnt think wed
eat a whole thing of lasagna but jeez
its almost gone
this is a record for you
think so
breaking the record
chi ate thirds for supper
heres your
can you eat another piece of garlic bread
you mustve ate it
was your hair cooling off up in a bun on your head today
well theres two things we can do
we can either keep it long enough so we can put it up in a bun or we can cut it short
well maybe you and i should go to the hair dresser soon
monday night tuesday night
either of those nights would be good
-uh day after tomorrow is monday
mm you think so
candles make shadows on the ceiling huh
i dont think a bit of a tooth could have fallen out
think you bit something that made your tooth feel funny
theres a little piece of garlic bread left
guess ill have to stop eating lasagna after this because there will not be any garlic bread to go with it
its tequila
you eat the lemon after you drink tequila
you were thinking about being a teacher at one point too werent you
well youve got plenty of time to decide
i think the thing to do is to see what kind of things you like to do as youre growing up
because that they might be the kinds of things youd like to do for a job
well maybe when youre a teenager you can get a job working in a store and see if you like it
yeah big d or a department store
where they sell clothes and stuff
well thats nearby
it would be a good job
first job
a lot of kids have jobs as teenagers
and for things theyre not planing on doing when they grow up
but theyre good jobs for teenagers to do
because they can work for a few hours around school and stuff
and in the summers
well one thing to do is like if you think youre interested in teaching remember how you had kids at saint agnus
high school kids that came in and helped in the afternoon
there were kids from emmys school
holy name
there was one girl from holy name that came in in the afternoons
i forget what her name was
teachers helpers like that
they were high school students that came in and helped in the afternoons
you could do something like that and try it to see if its something youd like to do when you grow up anyway
oh yeah
i found lasagna to go on my fork
i found a mountain
right there
i think thirds is probably as much as you should eat
you dont wanna get a bellyache
you can finish your garlic bread
with a couple bites
is that enough
well you certainly did very well tonight
looks as if you got your fingers so close to your eyes
that its bigger then anything else
what did you say
no the further away you get from your eyes the bigger its gonna look
watch your fingers
dont move your fingers
i have a big head
is that what youre saying
probably because he needs a haircut
mm i got big hair
we all need haircuts hm
i look like one of these teenage girls with their teased hair huh
can i have the rest of your bread if your not going to eat it
here want me to give your scraps to clyde chi
shes just like garfield
come on kittie
should we have dessert later
yeah in a few minutes
just sit and relax for a minute
sit on my lap
what are you going to do with five whole dollars
you could save it for something useful
was there a doll you said you were saving it for
oops a daisy
i think youd be saving for about a year
those dolls i think
are kind of expensive
twenty five to thirty dollars each
well no
right now you have five dollars
youd have to save five times more of your five dollars in order to buy one of those dolls
twenty five dollars
that would take quite a while
it took you five weeks to save five dollars
well she got a little bit
four weeks and a tooth
tooth falling out
but i dont think youre going to lose any
afford some of that huh
and buy one of the dolls
one thing you might save it for is if we
if save it you pay half and well pay half
go to the beach this summer
bring some spending money
buy something like shells or a sweatshirt
excuse me
well then save your money for the dolly
for what
no idea
save it for clothes
or books
you could go to mcdonalds with your savings
save it long enough you could go to a fancy restaurant
you can save it for whatever is important to you
then save it for a dolly
maybe well go to the store toy store in about a month
because its going to be close to marys birthday and well needta get her something
and you can look for something for yourself
youll have saved probably about ten dollars by then
in a month
you can certainly get something with ten dollars
so five plus ten will be fifteen
with another month would be another four weeks
so five weeks would be ten dollars
so just about the time of marys birthday youd have ten dollars
you could
maybe wed help you out
maybe wed negotiate that
you shouldnt chew on a scrap
lets wait and see
well have to look and see
mm yeah we saw that on tv this morning
they had little mermaid dolls out
its up to the tooth fairy
i dont -uh keep the latest stock quotes on teeth
i dont know
those teeth youre gonna have for a while
those back teeth
i think youve lost most of the ones youre going to lose right around this age
she has got two more
the ones beside her front two teeth
will come out in the next year
but it could be a year from now you know
back ones and the square ones tend to come out later
like when youre about ten or twelve
well i remember when emmy was ten she lost a whole bunch of teeth all at once
well the front teeth you lose when youre around six to seven
the back teeth you lose when youre ten to twelve
so you have a couple more in the front these two pointy ones that are right next to where the big hole is today
and thats probably it for a few years
so youll be rich for a little while because you lost all of your teeth but then youll be poor until you start losing the back ones
thats true
my money
saving the money
save the money
do you wanna spell it
what does it begin with
and then one letter at the end
its a silent
or as the song says
i know me
whos donald duck
the person sitting there is donald duck
are you daisy duck
shes pretty good as her
better than me
nope no
chi dont chew
youre like a puppy
thats what puppies do when they teethe chew on things
we read a story in the paper a couple of weeks ago about a dog who stole all the tennis shoes and things like that in the neighborhood
he took them off to a hill top
because he was teething
and finally somebody found out where he had taken all the shoes
they went to the top of the hill and they found this big pile of old shoes
sneakers and boots
well not your pocketbook handle
it will not be a handle anymore
youll chew it and itll break

i suppose its mice that come chew your barbie dollss fingers

timmy shouted
tim pointed at a car coming up the lane
well well have fun you and susan and me
lassie wriggled all over and barked excitedly
they would have fun
the car
whats wrong
the car pulled up and timmys cousin susan opened the door
susan hi yelled timmy running toward the car
lassie barked happily
boun bounding after him
eek shrieked susan when she caught sight of lassie
a dog
make it go away
and she scrambled back into the car and slammed the door
lassie stopped barking she stopped wriggling
ah susan timmy coaxed lassies the nicest dog in the whole world she will not hurt you
he looked down at lassie rubbing her head
well lassie he said sadly i guess youll have to be polite and stay away from susan until she gets useta you
and so with drooping head and limp tail lassie lay down under the lilac bush and susan got out of the car
she carried a yellow haired doll wearing a soft blue dress
this is maryann she said to timmy hugging her doll tightly
she doesnt like dogs either and she marched into the house
that night as lassie settled down on her rug next to timmys dad he whispered dont feel sad lassie tomorrow well make susan like you
and so after breakfast the next morning timmy and lassie played ball
but susan well she just sat on the steps and changed maryanns dress
later timmy and lassie played dressup
susan didnt play though she was busy having a make-believe tea party with maryann
but lassie thought she saw susan smile once watching them play
after dinner lassie did tricks
she shook hands with timmy she said please for a cookie and she rolled over and played dead
and with that susan laughed she laughed right out out loud
timmy was pleased and proud
lassie he said shake hands with susan
happily lassie moved forward but then make her go away shrieked susan as she darted into the house
timmy sighed alright susan he called you dont have to be friends with lassie if you dont wanna
come on ill show you the creek
timmy and susan had fun putting toys on dry leaves and watching as the little boats moved out into the swirling waters of the creek
lassie lying behind a log watched them playing until her eyelids slowly drooped shut
suddenly timmy spied a piece of wood lying nearby
oh look he said wood for a real boat
he tied a piece of string to it and sent it out into the stream then he pulled it back out and back out and back
susan looked down at maryann and had an idea
maryann would you like a boat ride
she said and so then the little boat went out with a passenger on it
timmy and susan watched their little boat bob in the water
then timmy started to bring it back to shore
suddenly the little boat teetered teetered
maryann wobbled and then as timmy and susan susan watched she slipped into the water and was carried down the stream
maryann susan wailed how will we get her back
timmy looked around lassie he called
where are you
but lassie was asleep her nose twitching gently as a fly buzzed near
timmy and susan ran along the bank following the bobbing doll
lassie timmy called again desperately
still lassie didnt hear
but suddenly the bothersome fly settled squarely on her nose
her eyes flew open she snuffed fiercely and then she heard timmys call lassie
with a bound she was on her feet looking around for timmy
then she was down at the waters edge
maryann cried susan pointing
lassie get maryann cried timmy
lassie splashed into the water and headed for maryann
swimming fast she followed the doll down the stream
slowly she drew near at last she reached out caught maryanns dress in her teeth and turned back toward the bay
lassie dropped the wet but safe maryann in the grass
stopped long enough to shake the water from her coat
and then she headed back for her place in the sun
she lay down and closed her eyes
but then at the sound of light foot steps lassie opened her eyes
susan hugging maryann dropped down beside her
lassie she said softly holding out her hand maryann and i wed like to shake hands with you
youre the nicest dog anywhere
who is
you bet said timmy and now will not we have fun you and lassie and me
lassie barked happily as she shook hands with susan
the end

theyre right here
which one
the little lost puppy
or which one do you want me to read you
ill read you one more book then you gotta go to bed
excuse you
sit up a little please
the little lost puppy
this is an old book
tommy bells white puppy with black paws and black ears was lost
tommy looked everywhere for him but could not find him
so he asked the three fat policemen who took care of his part of the town to help him find the puppy
they hunted for more then an hour but no one found him that white puppy with black paws and black ears
so each policeman decided to hunt in a special place
the first fat policeman went to look in the field across from the schoolhouse
there he heard a
it was a soft sad
that bird couldnt be happy
there far out on a branch was a yellow canary bird with a black stripe on each wing
the bird looked lost and sounded very lonely
the first fat policeman took him gently in his hand
the second fat policeman went to look in the narrow lane behind the shops on main street
he heard a meow
it was a soft sad meow
that cat couldnt be happy
there behind a big rubbish can was a small orange kitten
the kitten looked lost and sounded very lonely
the second fat policeman took her gentle in his arms
the third fat policeman went to look in the woods beyond the railroad tracks
there he heard nothing but the wind blowing through the trees
he was many anu animal footprints tracking back and forth in and out and across muddy paths all the way into the fields beside cross old mr dumps house
the three policemen met in the square in front of the town hall
look said the first fat policeman i didnt find tommy bells white puppy with black paws and black ears but i found this yellow canary bird with a black stripe on each wing
look said the second fat policeman i didnt find tommy bells white puppy with the black paws and black ears but i found a small orange kitten
well i didnt find tommy bells white puppy with the black paws and black ears either but i found many animal footprints tracking back and forth in the woods and running all the way into the fields beside cross old mr dumps house said the third fat policeman
i didnt hurt you
i just tapped you so you would listen
people gathered to find out what was the matter
look cried a small red headed boy theres molly greens yellow canary with the black stripe on each wing
look cried a small blue eyed girl theres the orange kitten miss prissy brought from the pet shop last week
the third fat policeman kept telling over and over in a loud voice about the all the animal footprints he saw
molly green came up and when she saw her yellow canary with the black stripe on each wing in the first poli policemans hand she hurried up to him and said oh thank you mr policeman for finding my lost canary
he was chased by a kitten this morning when i let him out of his cage to fly around a little
she took the yellow canary gently in her hands
pretty canary huh
like the kitten
you dont like the kitten
you like the dog
you want a dog huh
just then miss prissy came along the street
she saw the second fat policeman holding her small orange kitten and she hurried up to him and said oh thank you mr policeman for finding my lost kitten
she was chased by a puppy this morning
she took the kitten gently into her hands
just then tommy bell joined the crowd
the third fat policeman called out we cant find your puppy tommy
we found a yellow canary bird with black stripes on each wing and a small orange kitten and we saw lots of animal foot footprints tracking
tracking through the woods and across the fields but we cant find your white puppy with black paws and black ears
suddenly there was a loud barking noise
into the square came cross old mr dump leading his big brown watchdog
the big brown watchdog was barking at the big market basket his master was carrying
what a time what a time muttered cross old mr dump over and over
just then he saw the three fat policemen
officers officers he called i am glad to find you people in this town dont keep their pets at home
they run all over my fields and my big brown watch dog chases them
this morning there was a whole st string of them chased by this
mr dump was so excited he sped sputtered over the words as he opened the market basket he was carrying
out jumped a white puppy with black paws and black ears and ran right up to tommy wagging his stubby tail so hard it shook his whole body
the whole crowd cheered
tommy found his puppy tommy found his puppy
you keep your canary bird in his cage from now on so the kitten cant chase him said the first fat policeman to molly green
you keep your kitten i in her own yard so the puppy cant chase her said the second fat policeman to miss prissy
you train your puppy not to run away and chase other peoples pets said the third fat policeman to tommy
and you train your big brown watch dog not to chase every animal that runs in the woods and fields beside your house
i mean said all three fat policemen to cross old mister dump
thank you policemen for helping to find my puppy called tommy as he turned to run home
his white puppy with the black paws and black ears running along at his heels

doing what
because they asked me to tape
know sis water is good for you but you needta get milk in you too
ma i been getting milk in into me for a long time
no you havent
i have milk all the time for lunch at school
yeah so
one thing of milk isnt enough
could i have of the rice
there isnt any more
i have no idea
why does chi always have to -um have an appointment with these people
push your hair back
why does she always have to have an appointment
shes been having this for a long time
they always want you to record something
yeah they wanna see how her her language is
shes in a study
so thats why
like one one day when she didnt know how to say -um use she said sis you drank all toilet paper
like that
yeah theyre just studying
sis had gym
oh did you
we have some applesauce for -um dessert if you like
i dont like applesauce
i dont
well youre not having anything sweet
what am i having then
you can have a piece of fruit
eat over your plate
just leave it
no tomorrow is a crabmeat sandwich and you guys arent gonna going to like it
a what
the crab
its like seafood
i never knew they had that mot
you better eat that meat
get started on it
the meat is tender
dont start
but mot if her language gets better she she wont be going to these people no more
the reason why shes in this language study is not because her language is bad sis
then why
because when she was going to head start debbie asked if i would mind going in a language study
and shes gotta be in this for how long
i think this is the last year
why sis
well because i dont want her to miss any parts of school
she doesnt miss any parts of school

you told me it was gross and you didnt want the pizza
maybe they dont
they have it fridays

i didnt know that
whos coming
the new kindergarten students
the new kindergarten students are visiting
oh yes its freshman week
thats what its called

under the kitchen and trying to discard my brussels sprouts
everyone would actually believe that i really ate it
all the way to the kitchen and back
oh yes
i ate my brussel sprout in the kitchen
of course my mother found it in the disposal
i see
and let me ask you something
were the brussels sprouts mandatory
i mean like how did they get onto your plate in the first place
they were there
i do not like brussels sprouts
theyre the worst things ive ever tasted

its asparagus i dont like
i like asparagus

no one wanted his two cents
especially me
give me some sunshine
you picked up my fork and then you put it down in the one wet spot on the table

see i made mine with the white worcestershire and i made bros with barbecue sauce
you bought white worcestershire
no i made it
i cooked them all in separate -uh little tin foils
so that none would touch each other
is it
see you were using these for finding the different angles of flash flashlight on them
now ive been thinking
how i should go to court
like how i should dress
dress any way you want
i mean you know dress the neatest way you have like that shirt
dress up
and then have to
then have them all of sudden just change their decision for some reason and then have them instead of probation decide to try and commit me
and then that means ill be department of youth services for the night

so why dont you pull out that shirt that i washed the wool shirt that -uh is dressy
plus the grey pants like that you you wear that are in here
oh t plus bro

seventy plus seventy is one hundred and forty

two zebras could be a family
they could be brother and sister

wheres the elephants ear

all by his lonesome
he doesnt have a family

female lion

im going to come sit over here though
what what was that
they all live in the same place
time to go look for some nice grass and trees little child
wheres the lake
wheres the trees
giraffes like to eat leaves i think too
maybe they can all go splashing in the pond
the hippopotamus family likes to roll around in the water
maybe we can have an animal party
all come to the same place
we need some trees
make some water and the trees with the blocks
the blue will be the water
oh whoops
here comes the big tiger
oh yeah

thats what we just read about isnt it
dinosaurs yeah

because he has no ears and no tusks on this side
what other kind of animals do you think live with him
those giraffes five fun
do you think
how old is this one
do you think its the same age as this one

you look at
theyre about all about to charge
charge your feet
are you looking for the other puzzle piece
see what was in there
put this in the cup
wanna have dinosaur soup
wanna build some things for them to play on
build a bridge or something that they can go over or under
two of these blocks
or we could have a picnic
no a pretend one with dinosaur soup
see you take this out
we can pretend its in africa
because its an african elephant right
and we can have a picnic in africa
on the plains right
and we can have dinosaur soup
from the dinosaurs that died hundreds of years ago
millions of
and what do you think this is
football have bumps on them
it looks like something different to me
know what i think it is
a dinosaur egg
lets see
does it go in the egg
and this is the mommy and the daddy right
and they have the dinosaur egg and then what happens
a baby was born
out of the dinosaur egg
and now it has a baby
oh no
parents better protect you or else its going to get eaten up huh
there you go
not bad for cheating huh
oh look at this
look theyre different
hes a rhinoceros huh
a hippopotamus doesnt have a horn does it
he can open his mouth real wide though
oh theres a baby hippo too
let me see
are they the same kind
oh hes away
yeah hes away right now
he doesnt play with these guys because hes from a different planet
earth chi
gumbys from mars i think
isnt that where hes from
so he cant play with these guys
stay here and play with these ones and then well play with them later okay
chi he stays in this this box
these are the toys we are going to play with right now okay
gumbys tired
we had him doing of exercises
thats right
you know what
i have an i
chi come here
come on
well play with these now and we can play with that one later
this is nice that we have all these to play with right
no well stay right here
were gonna right here
do you wanna pretend that thats water
that the hippos are going into
okay what are you making huh
know what hippos do
remember on tv we saw the hippos go in the water
they go into the water and then they yawned
do you remember how they yawn
show how they yawn
and then they closed it right
it was huge
enormous mouth
open his mouth way up like that and then closing it
he had a big mouth huh
you know whats funny that they didnt talk about in the book
is that they can do the water up through their trunk
but their mouth is way up here
so they can open their mouths too and eat that way
what they do is use the trunk like we use our hands

wait let me read the small writing and see what it says he does
mister fixer home appliance repair
which ones of these animals do you think were around when the dinosaurs were around
they might not have looked just like they do now but theres some there that were around when the din
remember the book we were reading the other night that said there are some of these animals that
thats right
yeah he came
yeah he came later huh
the book we read said when these guys died later on animals came that started looking like this and they think they were related to them
not this one hes a baby isnt he

its a whole family
thats mister fixer huh
no you dont have to take it down this is special okay
yeah ill tell him

check it out dude
its his neck pin
hes giraffe pretty lopsided huh
this needs a little help
pretty radical wouldnt you say
what kind of car thing
oh and they put it up on the things
yeah the only thing is that it needs to have a space in between so somebody could look underneath it
he could crush the cars hes dinosaur so big
he has got such a big body but such a little head
he has
he has got a big neck
think it was like when the dinosaurs were around
do you think there were houses and people and
just dinosaurs
okay guys i hate to break up the dinosaur
you know this book
yeah we have read this before
the very hungry caterpillar
okay you wanna turn the pages
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf
yep thats the egg
one sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry little caterpillar
you see him
he started to look for some food
wh what day is that
its monday
on monday he ate through one apple but he was still very hungry
on tuesday he ate through two pears
do you know what day it is
on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry
you wanna read it
on thursday he ate through how many strawberries
you wanna count them
but he was still hungry
on friday he ate through
but he was still hungry
a pear
its a cherry pie
a muffin
and that night he had a stomachache
look at his face
what does he look like
he looks like he has really sick
the next day was sunday again
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better
and now he wasnt hungry anymore and he wasnt a little caterpillar anymore
he was a big fat caterpillar
hey hang on
wh do you know what this is
he built a small house called a cocoon
this is a cocoon
no hes see he build it around himself
hes inside of it
he stayed inside for more than two weeks
and then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out
know something else
beautiful butterfly
looked like you knew that book
have you read this one
what is it
well look at it
yeah remember
can i go to the moon asked baby bear
no you cant said mrs bear
its bathtime anyway youd have to find a rocket first
yeah you think so
baby bear found a rocket in the closet under the stairs
on this picture
secret passage
youre right
youre very smart
so he opened up the door and what do you think is inside
and then what did he do
whatre they having at their picnic
you you wanna know what he has on his head here
you know why i think thats so funny
thats a colander
you know what we do with a colander
we put our lettuce in it and wash it off and put our fruit in it
it has holes in it
and we wash it off
its what he has got on his head
thats funny
now what happens
how does he get back into his house
just like who
who else goes through the chimney
yeah i see that
his mom probably wants to know why hes so dirty
what did he leave on the side of the tub
and now what
wheres he going
to bed
do you wanna look at this book
this is a book about elephants
you want me to read it
elephants are the largest land animals
this baby looks tiny beside its mother
see the baby
he is pretty tiny
know what these are called
they fried the elephant into a hamburger
well you know
oh anabella told you that
well you know what you saw thats really right
i dont know if they fry them into hamburgers but they do take their tusks and they make jewelry out of it and its really unique
no thats what they do
they kill them and they take them
and its called ivory
and they make -um stuff out of it
mm part of the book
so but we will not do that okay
we will not eat any elephant burgers
but when the baby was born it weighed two hundred pounds
and was about three feet tall
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother
yeah theyre really big
because their mommies are really big too
and their daddies too
a baby elephant is called a calf
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time
she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old
a baby elephant may drink its mothers milk until it is four or five years old
yep youre five
it curls back its trunk while its feeding
yep youre right
thats what it looks like
only eating
there are two kinds of elephants asian and african
this is a female asian elephant
asian elephants are not as tall as as their african cousins
-um they said this ones an asian elephant
i dont know
lets see if itll explain it
they also have smaller ears and smaller tusks
the female called a cow often has no tusks at all
they call her a cow
see she doesnt have any tusks
and shes furry
yeah you might be right about that
that would be a good guess
so the asian ones they probably dont kill
and then maybe its the african ones that get killed
because this is an african elephant
male elephants are called bulls
african elephants have a dip in their backs
they also have ridges on their trunks which end in two points
asian elephants have a smoother trunk that ends in one point
see there what they talk about the dip in the backs
see how it goes down like that
like a camel
well its yeah its the opposite
see this one comes up like that
and this one goes down
your dad would be really proud of you to know that you know what a skateboard ramp looks like
his used
thats funny
oh okay
lets see here
sit back
the elephants nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax
theres a couple of things in here i had certainly never
this is a hyrax
it looks like a gerbil doesnt it
can you believe this is related
i dont know
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa
they dont look much like elephants but their feet are like elephantss feet only much smaller
this is called a sea cow
its true
thats what it says
okay if you can quit mommy laughing so hard we can read this book
okay the sea cow is called oh its called a manatee
its called a manatee but they also call it a sea cow
-um lets see
sea cows are shy creatures that never leave the water
their skin and teeth are like an elephants
some sea cows have even small trunks
even have small trunks
look at these elephants
yeah tusks
heres asian
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps
this asian cow elephant lives in nepal a small country north of india
you can see her small ears and her very small tusks
she has just got little ones
oh they call this one a cow
cow elephant
i dont know
thats just what they call
african elephants live in the plains as well as the forest
this african elephant lives in the open grassland
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine
big ears
do you see all those birds with him
have you seen pictures of elephants with all the birds sitting on their backs
its funny you can see it on tv
they all sit on the backs of the elephants
i dont think so
only on their backs
because if they sat up front what do you think the elephant would do
why do you think they sit on his back
they get a free ride probably
okay look at all these elephants
do you see some baby ones in there
look at the color of this elephant
eat meat
did you know that
i didnt know that
no they eat grass and leaves and fruit and bark
you know what bark is
its the outside of the tree
its like the skin of the tree
see thats why hes reaching up right there
to get the bark
thats the part of the tree you can chip off if you wanna
they eat the outside of the tree
yeah youre right
they eat two hundred and fifty pounds a day of grass and and bark
they use their trunks to reach up onto the high branches and they tear up the plants and strip the bark off the trees
i guess they dont wanna eat the plant part they just want the bark
they use their tusks to dig for salt
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too
you think he dug all that up
was he looking for some water
why do you think he needs salt
why would he wanna eat salt
thats what its saying
yeah theyre white
elephants drink an amazing amount of water about fifty gallons a day
thats fifty milk bottles
you know those big milk bottles that we have
the really big ones
he drinks fifty of those a day
maybe itll explain why theyre white
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time and then squirt the water down their throats
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies
they probably do
look its going to talk about how they take a bath
maybe we can find out why theyre white
lets see
elephants love to take baths
they are good swimmers and they like to
i cant see if you put your head down
they like to splash around in the water
mm i cant talk
you have to read the book now
calm down
calm down
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much elephants needta live near a lot of water
you know
okay i guess were not going to read
can you calm down a little bit
thomas youre banging me and the taperecorder okay
no sit down
because you you needta relax a little bit
so did you catch any of that
they needta live near the water because they like to drink so much of it
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects
to get rid of them
because the flies like to hover around them and and -uh fly near them
and other bugs
like maybe mosquitoes or
they often get rid of them by bake oh i see
by taking mud baths
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling in red mud
elephants live and travel in groups called herds
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred
so did you get that
they roll around in the mud to keep the bugs off of them
why they look orange
because its orange mud
they probably did say red
yeah they said red
you know what that might be why these ones are white
maybe they rolled around in some mud that turned white
to keep the bugs off
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals
they usually charge only if they are threatened
bull elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year
this is called being in oh please
thats the other word that i have trouble with
its some some african word probably from that i dont understand
-uh i dont know
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during this particular time of their life
oh look at those two elephants
what does it look like theyre doing
looks like theyre kissing each other
or maybe giving each other a bath
probably squirting each other
thats a sticker on your nose
calm down
calm down
im not going to read if
you all set
elephants are very smart animals
there are even schools for asian elephants
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trucks
elephants also carry people like these men with their bundles of grass
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work
african elephants are not as easy to train
often they are killed for their ivory tusks even though this is against the law
elephants deserve better treatment than this
its just what we were talking about isnt it
okay thats the end of the book
you do
you read it then
you gotta turn the page to the words
wait a minute now we gotta go careful

watch it
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies
elephants love to take baths
you like to take a bath and y youre not an elephant are you
and they like to splash around in the water
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much elephants needta live near a lot of water
want to turn it
why do they have
elephants are often bothered by flies or other insects
they get rid of them by taking mud baths
this group of african elephant looks red because they have been rolling in red mud
elephants live and travel in groups called herds
me either
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred
sit up
most of the time elephants are
they usually charge only if they are threatened
but elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year
this is called being in musth
zoo elephants
wait a minute
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth
at them
what what are they doing
im not sure
wait a minute
oh ma i wish i rode on one of them
elephants are very smart animals
there are even schools for asian elephants
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them into a truck
elephants also carry people like these men with their bundles of grass
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work
african elephants are not as easy to train
often they are killed for their ivory tusks even though this is against the law
elephants deserve better treatment than this
you wouldnt want anyone to pull out your tusks would you

they use their tusks to dig for salt
dig holes in dry river beds to find water
they often
then then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too
you see what theyre doing
theyre digging holes to get water
because theyre thirsty
wow look at it all huh
about fifty gallons a day
no hes not
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks over all over their bodies
remember at the zoo
when they squirt themselves with the water
do you remember
oh yeah
well have to
elephants love to take baths
they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much elephants needta live near a lot of water

animals in the wild elephant
elephants are the largest land animals
this baby looks tiny beside its mother
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds and was about three feet tall
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother
isnt he cute
you were a baby
hes a baby elephant
a baby elephant is called a calf
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time
she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old
a baby elephant may drink its mothers milk until it is four or five years old
it curls back its trunk while feeding
there are two kinds of elephants asian and african
this is a female asian elephant
asian elephants are not as tall as their african cousins
they also have smaller ears and tusks
the female called a cow often has no tusks at all
this is an african elephant
male elephants are called bulls
african elephants have a dip in their backs
they also have ridges on their trunks which end in two points
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point
the elephants nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa
they dont look much like elephants but their feet are like elephantss feet only much smaller
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow
the sea cow is called a manatee
sea cows are shy creatures that never leave the water
their skin and teeth are like an elephants
some sea cows even have small tusks
see the difference
this ones the water
it lives in the water
and this one lives in holes
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps
this asian cow elephant lives in nepal a small country north of india

african elephants live in in the plains as well as forests
the african elephant lives in the open grassland
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine
theyre walking together
look at that little baby there attached to his mommy

like you are
elephants do not eat meat
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day
they use their trunks to reach high branches tear up plants and strip the bark off trees
they use their tusks to dig for salt
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too
elephants drink an amazing amount of water about fifty gallons a day
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies
elephants love to take baths
they are swimmers they like to splash around in the water
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much elephants needta live near a lot of water
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects
they get rid of them by by taking mud baths
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling in red mud
elephants live and travel in groups called herds
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred

animals in the wild elephant
elephants are the largest land animals
this baby looks tiny besides its mother
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds and it was about three feet tall
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother
look at that
its two hundred pounds
you know how many pounds you are
you weighed yourself last night
how many pounds are you
forty thats right
a baby elephant is called a calf
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time
but she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old
a baby elephant may drink its mothers milk until it is four or five years old
it curls back its trunk while it feeds
there are two kinds of elephants asian and african
do you needta see
you think so
asian elephants are not as tall as their african cousins
they also have smaller ears and tusks
the female called a cow often has no tusks at all
i think youre right
because look
this is an african elephant
oh my
male elephants are called bulls
african elephants have a dip in their backs
they also have ridges on their trunks which ends in two points
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point
you can see that
elephants nearest living relatives are small furry creature called a hyrax
you saw this before
hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa
they dont look much like elephants but their feet are like elephantss feet only much smaller
another close relative
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow
this sea cow is called a manatee
look at this guy huh
sea cows are shy creatures that never leave the water
their skin and teeth are like an elephants
some sea cows even have small tusks
what do you think these
asian or african
oh what do you think these are
asian or african elephants
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps
this asian cow elephant lives in nepal a small country north of india
small ears and her very small tusks
in the plains as well as the forests
this african elephant lives in the open grassland
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine
wow look at all these
yeah kind of like dumbo i guess
oh look at that one
elephants do not eat meat
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day
they use their trunks to reach high branches tear up plants and strip the bark off trees
because thats how they eat them there chi right out of the branch
big grabber
they use their tusks to dig for salt
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too
so they do all the work
and then all the little guys come and chow down
thats the little one
elephants drink an amazing amount of water about fifty gallons a day
they suck up quarts of water into their trunk at a time then squirt the water down their throats
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies
usually that stuffs pretty clean
yeah i did but
you wanna finish this book
oh okay
why dont you sit back so you can see the pictures
are you getting sleepy
oh i see
elephants love to take baths
they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much elephants needta live near a lot of water
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects
they get rid of them by taking mud baths
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling in red mud
kind of like you were in the sandbox today at school
elephants live and travel in groups called herds
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred
most of the time elephants are peaceful
they usually charge only if they are threatened
bull elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year
this is called in the musth
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth
that was in my book that im
even there are even schools for asian elephants
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trucks
elephants also carry people like these men with their bundles of grass
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work
african elephants are not as easy to train
often they are killed for their ivory tusks even though it is against the law
elephants deserve better treatment than this
dont you think so
isnt that terrible
people kill them for just that little piece of white tooth on them
oh well they i think if they got afraid and they maybe -um charged they could maybe trample people
but i dont think that would happen very often do you
so you just want us to go through the book
yep just like you would normally

they eat as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day
they use their trunks to reach high branches tear up plants and strip the bark off trees
they use their tusks to dig for salt

elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects

it says animals in the wild
elephant by mary hopkin
what whats on his back
elephants are the largest land animals
this baby looks tiny beside its mother
but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds and was about three feet tall
it grew inside its mother for over over one year and ten months more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother
big huh
elephant is called a calf
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time
you know what that means
she only has one baby at a time
you know how kittens and dogs have four and five babies at one time
the elephant only has one
they call a baby elephant a calf
she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old
a baby elephant may drink its mothers milk until it is four or five years old
it curls back with its trunk while feeding
what are they doing
no theyre nursing
the babies
thats how they get their milk and their food
there are two kinds of elephants asian and african
this is a female asian elephant
asian elephants are not as tall as their african cousins
the african ones are taller then the asian ones
they also have smaller ears and tusks
wheres the ears
right and the tusks
yeah look at the tusks over here
theyre much longer on the african elephant right
the asian one
the female or the girl is called a cow she often has no tusks at all
so she doesnt even have any see
this is an african elephant
over here
male elephants are called bulls
african elephants have a dip in their backs
they also have ridges on their trunks which end in two points
they also have ridges on their trunks which end in two points
down here
down there
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point
so their their trunks are smoother
the elephants nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa
they dont look much like elephants but their feet are like elephantss feet only much smaller
can you believe that those are like cousins to the elephant
and theyre so much smaller
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow
this sea cow is called a manatee
sea cows are shy creatures that never leave the water
their skin and teeth are like an elephants
some sea cows even have small tusks
they probably come out there
whats different about the sea cow from an elephant
where does it live
in the water
and the elephant lives where
out of the water on land
there they are
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps
this asian cow elephant lives in nepal a small country north of india
you can see her small ears and her very small tusks
african elephants live in the plains as well as the forests
this african elephant lives in the open grassland
yep hes on the front thats right
same picture
very good
african elephants live in the plains as well as forests
know what the plains are
its flat land and its grassy
and theres not many trees
so its like that
whereas in the forest where the asian elephants live theres a lot of trees
and water
theres not as much water on the plains in africa
and there is an open grassland
see how open it is
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine
you know how you have a fan and go like that
thats what they do with their ears to cool them off
is that full-page picture a forest or a plain
elephants do not eat meat
they eat grass leaves
elephants do not eat meat
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day
they use their trunks to reach high branches
they use their trunks to tear up plants
and strip the bark off trees
you know how trees sometimes you can peel something off of it
its a hard but they can do that with their trunks
instead of plants
they eat it
they use their tusks to dig for salt
see how its doing that
its digging it right into the ground
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too
so they can dig into the ground with their tusks and then water will come up
and then they have something to drink
elephants drink an amazing amount of water about fifty gallons a day
thats a lot of water
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks
they they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats
down their throats
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies
like a hose
and then they spray it all over themselves to cool down
elephants love to take baths
they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much elephants needta live near a lot of water
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects
they get rid of them by taking mud baths
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling around in red mud
elephants live and travel in groups called herds
a herd may be a few animals
like three or four
or a few hundred
so of course you are going to do that right
come on chi youre getting silly now
would you listen to the story
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals
they usually charge only if they are threatened
do you know what that means
they usually charge only if they are threatened
that means that if you come up to them and you scare them
then theyll charge you
but otherwise if you dont scare them they probably will not
bull elephants get very excitable and angry
okay its what nicky does to you when youre playing
and runs into you
he stands across the room and then you run over to him and then you crash into him
thats a charge
bull elephants get very excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year
this is called being in a a musth
a musth
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth musth
theyre hugging huh
elephants are very smart animals
there are even schools for
thats the same as that
theyre very smart animals
there are even schools for asian elephants
do you know elephants have schools
you do now
well let me read it and well find out
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trucks
elephants also carry people like these men with their bundles of grass
so they take a bunch of elephants and they bring them to elephant school
and they teach them to drag piles of heavy logs
you know when trees are cut down
and theyre theyre very heavy logs and they teach the elephants to drag them
and then to load them with their trunks
they pick them up
and they put them on the truck
and then they teach them to carry people and their bundles of grass
and thats what they learn at elephant school
do you think theyll learn how to add
and count and read
they do elephant things
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work
african elephants are not as easy to train
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work
in other words they go out and they find them all over the place
one here and one there and one there
and they round them up
that means they get them all together in in one group
and these are rounded up elephants because theyre all together
african elephants are not as easy to train
they dont learn as fast
often they are killed for their ivory tusks
because they like the
they were sticking into the ground
and they people take that from them
even though it is against the law
elephants deserve better treatment than this
the end
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf
okay thats the moon

the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better
now he wasnt hungry anymore and he wasnt a little caterpillar anymore

but when it was born it weighed two hundred pounds and was about three feet tall
it grew inside its mother for over one year and ten months
more than a year longer than a human baby needs to grow inside its mother
a baby elephant is called a calf
a mother elephant usually gives birth to one calf at a time
she will not give birth again until her calf is about three years old
a baby elephant may drink its mothers milk until it is four or five years old
it curls back its trunk while feeding
oh you see them touching
there are two kinds of elephants asian and african
this is a female asian elephant
asian elephants are not as tall as their african cousins
they also have smaller ears and tusks
the female called a cow often has no tusks at all
see the difference
youre right
oh like im big and youre little
he will grow
this is an african elephant
male elephants are called bulls
african elephants have a dip in their backs
they also have ridges on their trunks which end in two points
asian elephants have smoother trunks that end in just one point
hey look at this
the elephants nearest living relative is a small furry creature called a hyrax
these hyraxes live in rocky holes in africa
they dont look much like elephants but their feet are like elephantss feet only much smaller
another close relative of the elephant is the sea cow
this sea cow is called a man manatee
i know
this is new
sea cows are shy creatures that never leave the water
their skin and teeth are like an elephantss
some sea cows even have small tusks
wouldnt wanna ride an elephant
oh you gotta hold on
asian elephants
oh yeah
asian elephants often live in forests and swamps
this asian cow elephant lives in nepal a small country north of india
you can see her small ears and her very small tusk
african elephants live in the plains as well as forests
this african elephant lives in the open grassland
it flaps its huge ears to help keep cool in the hot african sunshine
elephants do not eat meat
they eat grass leaves fruit and bark as much as two hundred and fifty pounds a day
they use their trunks to reach high branches tear up plants and strip the bark off trees
they use their tusks to dig for salt
they also dig holes in dry river beds to find water
i dont know
i dont know maybe hell step on it
they also oh i read that
then other thirsty animals come and drink the water too
see him looking look for water
elephants drink an amazing amount of water about fifty gallons a day
thats a lot of water
they suck up quarts of water into their trunks at a time then squirt the water down their throats
they also bathe by squirting the water from their trunks all over their bodies
elephants love to take baths
they are good swimmers
and they like to splash around in the water
come on
they are good swimmers and they like to splash around in the water
because they drink so much and enjoy swimming so much a lot of water
elephants are often bothered by flies and other insects
they get rid of them by taking mud baths
this group of african elephants looks red because they have been rolling in red mud
elephants live and travel in groups called herds
a herd may be a few animals or a few hundred
most of the time elephants are peaceful animals
they usually charge only if they are threatened
bull elephants get very excite excitable and angry for a few weeks or months about once a year
this is called being in mu musth
is that in love
ive never heard of that one either this book has some things ive never heard of
zoo elephants must be kept by themselves during musth
look at this
what is it doing
looks like theyre kissing
elephants are very smart animals
there are even schools for asian elephants
they are taught to drag piles of heavy logs and load them onto trunks
elephants also carry people like these men with their bundles of grass
these asian elephants are being rounded up to be trained for work
african elephants are not as easy to train
often they are killed for their ivory tusks even though this is against the law
elephants deserve better treatment than this

oh you can make all sorts of designs huh
does it stick to the side too
kind of
what is this
you should put a red with a blue one
the marbles stick too
thats neat
mountain of magnets
they will not stick to each other though huh
they will not stick together
stick to each other
these balls
oh it looks like a staircase
thats pretty neat
its a staircase to where
to nowhere
to somewhere
to the sky
stairway to heaven
ive seen things like that on peoples desks
different things which you can make shapes with
why dont i get one
you got a battery in it
thats a good idea
maybe i will
theyre kind of fun
gee if i get bored at work i could just
play with it huh
oh i thought you were going to get one
oh i met s somebody who useta have something similar to this at work
on their desk
barely touching and it went on its side
its a strong magnet
wanna try
hold the top thing
how come the rocks dont stick to this
because what
they almost jump to each other huh
they look like they jump
they get pulled
if if you hold it just above here
then you can feel it pulling
hold hold it just above but not touching
the black
hold it up here
and you can feel it pull it down
i think that one is too heavy
its like a magic wand huh
remember that thing in the brave little toaster
that picks up the cars
time ago
little toaster was on a belt
mixed in with all these junk cars
well its the same idea
you guessed it huh
those we could build around it
probably a metal ball
because this is plastic and that wouldnt stick like a magnet
but it does so theres probably a metal ball inside
quiet please
i knew she sis was gonna come in for this
think we could open one up
i dont think we should
no i dont think so
think it
does this rock stick
how do you know
does the crab stick
yeah thats just what we did
okay now what
what it will not close
oh no i bet its not a little metal ball inside
its probably a magnet inside
because look it works even though its not on here
you need a magnetron for that

that they cling to each other and you get your fingers pinched in between them a lot

watch this
wait a minute
watch it always happens
it doesnt go down on the sides
it always go on the
try it
see if itll go this way
it never lands that way
how come
it always lands up like that
how come mine doesnt roll around like yours
how come the dime doesnt stick
these stick
lets watch which ones stick
try one of the colored ones
try the green
that sticks
try another one
you try that one

try the balls
you take two and ill take two
you scratched me
oh okay
put them close
them high because you dont wanna break them
do you know what
lets put one of these nuts in the middle
see if it lands inside it
lets try something
i try to push it to the side
it goes back to the middle
dont push it off but look its right there
the magnet must not be on the side because it goes right into the middle
and why arent they touching
why dont they touch
they dont match together
you going to match with this one
see how they stick with
yeah they stick with this one ball bearing to red circle
im trying to make a design
you know what that must mean
because watch watch what happens
this is on top of it right
now when i put this one
it got moved over
so that must mean that this magnet is stronger then the ones in here
because it pushed them away
you can feel it
put your other ones down
feel the outside
i want you to feel how strong it is
just put it near it
dont let it take it
just put it near it
feel it
try to do it without it grabbing it
like im doing right now
and you can feel it pulling down
try that
hold on to it though
dont let go
you feel it pulling
try not to let it touch
get is as close as you can without touching
now watch im going to do it over you
go ahead
you do that
t try not touch each other
you go as close to that as you can
get the red ones as close to that one as you can
it goes up and down huh
because its going to that magnet and to this magnet
the rocks dont though
how come how come all the silver colored ones stick but the money doesnt stick
you know why
you think money has is a magnet
because its a different metal
but its the same color
oh i know
put him underneath
so the crabs are underneath rocks
it will match
watch this
did you see that
only one side goes down
this side doesnt like to be that way
it likes to flip over
watch ill let go
try this
feel that
feel it
feel it trying to flip over
dont let go though
just hold on to it and watch what it tries to do
try to put it flat
see it tries to flip it
now let go

but on this side it stays the same
oh no it does too
so only one side of these stick to it

now how come
wait a minute
oh yeah
chi im sorry my mind was thinking about this as a mat look at this
im not holding it
wait wait wait here you do it
it wont stay up because its round
how come the rocks dont stick chi
are you sure
theres a magnet in here
yeah see
remember what i told you sometimes mot what
remember the other day
i said to you sometimes i say things
just to see if you know it
and then i tell you that youre silly and youre right there is no magnet and thats why it doesnt stick
see i couldnt ca oh to catch you off guard thats what i said to you the other day remember
but you always what
moms proud
lets make something else
what is it
is your mind working
good i its working
youre not gonna tell me what youre gonna going to -um
its gonna be a surprise
i love surprises alright
ill figure it out youll see i think
or not
you gotta give me a hint
but why not
well i cant guess that is it a house
oh alright
alright do i have to be patient
until im done
youre busy at work
leaning tower of pizza
i knew that
i know
okay wait i gotta catch you off guard i cant just say it
this one will stick
then why doesnt it stick
how come youre so smart

it does look like that doesnt it
you like to do this
i always ruin something when i start that
alright dont throw it
anything you want

no when it sticks when metal sticks to metal
you dont remember huh

looks like metal huh
i wish
wait a minute
no thats
lobster sandwich
i dont think so im teasing
i think its a rock
dont drop it too hard on the glass
this is probably creating havoc on that taperecorder
how come what sticks
now do you think he sticks
you have two magnets right
and theyre strong ones so you can put one magnet on one side of him and the other magnet on the other side
and it still works because theyre close enough together that the magnets catching each other
itd probably work on him hes a little thicker
heres one yeah it is one of your magnetic marbles i wonder where the rest of them are
its very nice
i think you could probably sell that to somebody who professes to
like abstract art you could probably get quite a bit for that
more than that
you cant keep these
what do you do with this big magnet
-um oh you can just play with it

and they figured they had enough potato chips and candy and cheese puffs and junk food like that
so she probably asked the teacher in order to get the party hats
see what i mean
is that at the school already
well maybe somebody else will bring the cheese popcorn then
did miss moore like her sweetheart box
yeah did she give the other teachers some
well i told you to give it to your favorite teacher
miss moore is your favorite teacher
dont you like miss moore the best
thats why i got you to carry it
so that likes to help you out the most
but the choice hadta be yours on which one of your teachers you give it to
yeah ive heard a lot of good things from miss moore about you
and you tell me a lot of good things about miss moore
the other ones keep picking on you sometimes though
whose teacher is miss redding
do you sit at miss reddings table
she at home
yeah i told you
i knew that cheese toast was going to start looking good
do you want a piece
then youd been awfully upset because me and sis would a ate up all of them all by ourselves
huh sis

she likes to rub it up against her gums because its nice and chewy
i started to wanting to use the rolls instead of the regular bread because see this the roll is chewier
youve gotta brush your teeth after you finish this
huh boo
yeah weve gotta get you a little toothbrush you got four teeth hanging in there
i know we have to get her a baby one
a little tiny one
yeah i know but its not nice to use somebody elses toothbrush because everybody has different germs in their mouth
see if you have a cold bug right
and you brush your teeth and you get the cold germs on it and all the different food and stuff out of your teeth on that toothbrush and sis get all that stuff all the germs off after she uses your toothbrush
and i mean even though you rinse it out you might not that good and so on and so on and so on
not a good idea to share somebody elses toothbrush

but it said every girl in the kingdom must be there said cinderella
the stepmother smiled and said of course you may go cinderella you may go if you do your work first and if you have a dress to wear
oh thank you said cinderella as she ran up to her room
some mice lived in cinderellas room they were cinderellas friends she has even made little clothes for them
guess what she cried im going to a ball at the palace
hurray cried the mice then she showed them an old dress
it just needs a little mending said cinderella and maybe a sash and some beads to make it pretty
yes cinderellie said the mice
cinderella called the stepmother
cinderella went downstairs i want you to clean the floor wash the windows dust and dust the drapes said the stepmother
but i did that yesterday said cinderella

cinderella worked as fast as she could but there were always one more thing to do
cinderella cinderella cinderella oh dear said cinderella i will never have time to mend my dress
they make cinderellie work said a fat mouse named gus
she will have no time to fix her dress said a skinny mouse named jack
we can do it cried the mice we can fix cinderellies dress
gus and jack sneaked into a big room where stepsisters were dressing for the ball
i hate this old sash said drusilla as she threw it down
i never wanna see these beads again said anastasia as she dropped them on the floor
jack grabbed the sash gus picked up the beads they took them to cinderellas room
look we found these said gus
now we can makes cinderellies dress really pretty said jack
they measured they cut they folded they sewed they worked and worked as fast as they could the hours went by quickly
cinderella hadta help the sisters with their dresses
when she was done the stepmother said it is time to go to the ball girls are you ready cinderella
no said cinderella sadly
i did not have any time to fix my dress
too bad said the stepsisters
you must learn to work faster said the stepmother
they watched cinderella go up to her room
when cinderella opened the door she saw something wonderful her dress was ready
surprise cried the mice
it is the prettiest dress i have ever seen said cinderella as she put it on
cinderella we ran downstairs wait she called i can go now i have a dress
the stepmother and stepsisters could not believe their eyes
my sash cried drusilla my beads cried anastasia
they ripped off the sash and pulled off the beads cinderellas dress was ruined
come along girls said the stepmother the prince is waiting for you
and off they went to the palace and cinderella was left behind
cinderella ran into the garden the mice ran after her
how i wished to go to the ball said cinderella
there was no use wishes never come true
never my dear said a voice
cinderella looked up there was a little woman with a wand
i am your fairy godmother she said i am here to give you your wish
now let me see said the fairy godmother
i need a pumpkin and a horse and a dog
what luck they are right here
ah yes i will need some mice
when the mice heard this they began to run
but the fairy godmother stopped them with her wand
a coach the horse turned into a coachman the dog turned into a footman and the mice turned into white horses
my dear
oh it says white horses
suppose that that looks almost like white but its not huh
now hop in my dear said the fairy godmother
but my dress said cinderella
oh my cried the fairy godmother
i almost forgot
she waved her wand again cinderella looked down her dress turned into a white gown her shoes turned to glass slippers
oh thank you said cinderella
now hop into the coach said the fairy godmother
but remember all the magic ends when the clock strikes twelve
i will not forget she said
and off she went to the palace
shes gonna forget
at the ball the king was complaining the prince has met all the girls in the kingdom he said and he has not found one he likes
give him time said the grand duke he has had enough time cried the king
just then cinderella came into the ballroom when the prince saw her he bowed
may i have this dance he said
yes said cinderella
all night the prince danced only with cinderella
they danced around the floor as if in a dream
everyone said how lovely she is who can she be
the hours went by quickly suddenly the clock began to strike midnight
cinderella ran down the palace steps as she ran she lost a glass slipper
when the prince reached the steps cinderella was gone
she he picked up the tiny glass slipper
the girl who wore this slipper is the girl i wanna marry said the prince
he told the grand duke to find her
even before cinderella was home the magic ended
the coach turned back into a pumpkin the coachmen turned back into a horse the footman turned back into a dog and there was cinderella and the mice just like before
the next day the grand duke took the glass slipper to every house in the kingdom
at last he came to the house where cinderella lived cinderell cinderella was in her room
first drusilla tried a slipper her foot was much too long
then anastasia tried the slipper her foot was much too wide
are there any other girls in this house asked the grand duke
no said the stepmother
just then cinderella came downstairs
who is this asked the grand duke
i dont care she must try the slipper
it fit perfectly
so cinderella reached in her pocket and pulled out the other glass slipper
the grand duke bowed to cinderella
you are the girl the prince said he must marry said the grand duke
so cinderella went to the palace and married the prince and they lived happily ever after

the end
mr rush
mr rush was the fastest thing on two feet
he useta rush here and there and there and here and back again all the time and of course he was always in such a rush that he never ever finished anything properly
one morning he woke up with a start
he had only had time for three hours sleep because he had been rushing about for so long the day before
oh dear he cried leaping out of bed
im late
and he rushed into his bathroom and washed up not very well as he was in such a hurry and brushed one tooth and rushed downstairs three at a time
he had a boiled egg and toast and a cup of tea for breakfast
he boiled the egg for five seconds and it tasted awful
he toasted the bread for only one second so it wasnt brown at all
and so he couldnt bear to wait for the kettle to boil he made his tea with cold water
ah what a horrible breakfast and of course he was in such a a rush he only ate half of it
silly fellow
after his half of breakfast he rushed off again out of his front door leaving it open down his garden path out of his garden gate leaving it open too and off down the lane
yeah it is
he passed mr happy
good morning mr rush called mr happy
where are you off to
cant stop cried mr rush im in too much of a hurry
i can see that thought mr happy to himself as he watched mr rush disappear into the distance
i wonder where hes going
where mr rush was going was nowhere fast as usual
he rushed around all morning and then rushed home and had a quick bite to eat a sandwich without bread and then rushed off again and then rushed around all afternoon
that evening he was reading a magazine he never had time to read a book when he saw an advertisement for a vacation
oh he said id like that
i havent had a vacation for ages
but then he frowned
i cant go on a vacation he thought because i dont have any money
and then he thought again and he smiled
i know he thought
ill get a job
and so the following morning he rushed off and got a job with a farmer milking cows
but of course he wasnt any good at that because if theres one thing a cow cant stand its being rushed especially when its being milked
so mr rush rushed off and got himself another job driving a bus but of course he wasnt any good at that
he was always in such a rush that he never stopped at any of the bus stops
and if theres one thing people waiting at a bus stop dont like is when the bus doesnt stop for them
so mr rush rushed off and got himself another job as a waiter
but of course he wasnt any good at that either
no sooner had he served people a meal and they had taken one bite then hed whisk the plate away from under their noses and if theres one thing hungry people cant stand its having food whisked away from them
poor mr rush no job no money
oh dear he sighed to himself
im never going to be able to go on vacation
he looked very gloom and gloomy
he is
okay but
but then an idea came to him
an idea for a job for someone who rushes around all the time
an ideal job for someone who was the fastest thing on two feet
do you know what that job was
would you like to know what that job was
a postman delivering express letters
mr rush was so good at it he delivered twice as many letters in half the time any postman had ever done it before
soon he had saved enough money for that vacation of his
and so the very next week there was mr rush on vacation sitting on a beach in the hot sun under a palm tree
this is the life he grinned and rushed off for a swim
his fifteenth that day and then it was breakfast time
the end
you do
yeah thats him
the very hungry caterpillar
the very hungry caterpillar
for my sister christine
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf
can you see it okay
one sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of an egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar
on monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry
he started to look for some food
on tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry
on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry
on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry
on friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry
on saturday he ate through a piece of chocolate cake an ice cream cone one pickle one slice of cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon
thats a lollipop
no its a lollipop
that night he had a stomachache
no oh
they cut the salami and it it fell down there
the next day was sunday again and the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better
now he wasnt hungry anymore and he wasnt a little caterpillar anymore he was a big fat caterpillar
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself
he stayed inside for more than two weeks
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out and then
he was a beautiful butterfly

it was nice to meet you
it rained and the rain dripped through baby bears helmet
see the holes in the helmet
what happened
home went baby bear back down the chimney and and on to the living room carpet with a what
whoops whats that
boo boos
missus missus bear came into the room
how did you get so dirty she gasped as she took him to the bathroom
you look like youve been up the chimney
awoh does it look like he has been up the chimney
i have said baby bear
first i found a rocket then i put on my space helmet and then i flew to the moon
oh my said missus bear laughing
what will you think of next
shes washing him
now what
then hes going to go where
okay oh boy this is good
chicken little
who did that
sit down
here we go
lets see how much you remember
whos that
poultrys coming announced foxy loxy as he spotted chicken little skipping down the road
that little will make a tasty chicken salad sandwich he chuckled
whos that
whats those
do remember what that is
but before chicken little got close enough for foxy loxy to pounce an acorn fell from an oak tree and hit her on the head
help the sky is falling shivered the little bird
the cries were heard by henry penny
whats the matter she asked
the sky is falling cried chicken little
a piece of it hit me on the head
henry penny was horrified
call the police she cried
the sky is falling the sky is what
that hen has a plump pair of what
yeah drumsticks observed foxy loxy and theyll be mighty tasting southern
southern fried
he was about to change charge forward and capture the two chickens when the clamor reached ducks duckie lucky
whats all that clam about he demanded
the sky is falling cried henry penny
a piece of it hit chicken little on the head
this is terrible squealed duckie lucky and together the three birds wailed help police the sky is falling
foxy loxy shivered with glee when he imagined how delicious duckie lucky would taste simmered in spicy sauce
help police the sky is falling
but before he could spring from his hiding place the cries of the group were heard by goosey loosey and -uh gobbling giblet
what luck whispered the fox
ill toast that bite sized one as soon as i get home and ill pop the fat one into the freezer until christmas
the sky is falling
foxy loxy almost fainted with delight when turkey lurkey came running across the field
theres a thanksgiving feast he chuckled
this is the luckiest day of my life
he was about to pounce on his victims when suddenly he realized it was six against one and the turkey and the goose looked like pretty tough birds he murmur murmured murmured
ill avoid a shuffle by outsmarting those foolish birds
these two
karate outfit there
yeah and hes a weightlifter it looks like dont you think
and whats he doing now
yep hes not really though
says poultry underneath and then hes putting on there to make it look like police on his truck okay
yeah right because he didnt really spell it right either did he
disguising his truck and himself he approached the group and announced officer loxy at your service folks
what seems to be the problem
the sky is falling chorused the birds
a piece of it hit me on the head added chicken little
this is an emergency declared the fox
into the truck and ill take you directly to headquarters
what are they doing
chicken little looking at
yeah because why
yeah hes remembering what what did he see
suddenly as she looked more closely at the fox chicken chicken little remembered the wanted poster she had seen in the town
its foxy loxy she shivered
run for your lives
the birds tried to escape but foxy loxy threw the chicken little into the truck and locked the door
before driving off the fox couldnt resist reading the recipes he had selected for each of his captures
and as for that nonsense about the sky falling he sneered this is what bounced on your head
with a triumphant laugh he hurled the acorn sky ward jumped into the truck and cried on to the kitchen
whats that
the acorn soared above the tree tops and lodged itself in the propeller gear of a sky patrol helicopter piloted by sergeant pickle hefty
the gears jammed
the the propeller stopped turning and the helicopter plunged towards the earth
whats this
parachute right
the falling helicopter crashed into the cab of the poultry truck
foxy loxy leaped from the wreckage screaming the sky is falling the sky is falling
stop that thief cried the birds
sergeant hefty flattened the fleeing fox
you are under arrest he announced
you mean i am under a fat hippo snapped foxy loxy
during his trial foxy loxy insisted that he was innocent but the judge sent him to prison on a diet of green beans and weed juice
on her way home chicken little recovered the what
she planted it next to her coop
years later when the acorn had grown into an oak tree her grandchildren loved to snuggle beside chicken little and listen to the adventure

yeah hes just a little extraterrestrial
is that right ross
if you left all your toys in there itd make no sense

whats all the crying about
youre hungry
are you hungry
and a little earlier we were talking about the gelflings actually the angus bangus and their itsy bicis raccoon angus bangus bear and itsy bicis raccoon
this is the boy gelfling and this is the girl gelfling i got it wrong
why is this the girl gelfling why is this the boy
right and everybody knows that the boy
and why why does that mean that hes a boy
because the boy one has the crystal in the movie that means that he must be the boy one because he has the crystal in his back
this one right
okay arent you using the other one
okay so now should i just put it down right here
are you guys ready to come out of bed now
you just going to play in bed some more
what are they doing
i hope theyre dying because if
if the white blood cells do not stop the harmful bacteria
the harmful bacteria will kill the body
you will get infection and eventually you will die
so its that thats why we count on those white blood cells
dont we
thats why we can count on them mark dont worry
thats why theyre there
do you feel better now that you have white
but whos really important
the band aid
they risk their lives
you know what they do
you know what the
you wanna hear what the white guys do
they eat up the bacteria
they get they gobble them like this
they this is what a cell looks like
do you see any pictures of what cells look like
and then they gobble they they
cells can change their shape
and youre a pretend youre a little bacteria
then ill just go like this
now you gobble you up
the bacteria have no defense against
and so then the harmful bacteria are finished
do you want me to read the whole story
do you wanna hear
you have to stop talking okay
ross is talking more about his dreams
you do
hes hiding from you
hes trying to hide from you ross
hes been good

to the other time
that was the flood
the little ones
we didnt see any huge dinosaurs that eat people
what are these

hey mark ‡ you d you forgot to tell aunt moira the part about the bridge
remember the bridge that we went over
the big tall bridge
tell her
let mark tell it
marks gonna tell the taperecorder a story
go ahead „ mark
you shouldnt stop it „ mark
few days back -uh mark and i went for the bus and as -uh because i was dashing for the bus in the car he said
i wish that some people didnt have to sit in the car and listen to other people get mad at the bus
i wasnt even cursing the bus at that point but -um its typical that i get down to the end of the street and the bus is already past and hasnt bothered to stop or anything and and -uh and i curse out the bus
and so mark has been trying to get me to stop saying anything about the bus even when we miss it by a hair
-um ross was talking about
dad ‡ you know that youre gonna be here on the first day of spring and moms gonna be in california
and i said
yeah ross ‡ you i know
i looked at the calendar
thats right
and he said
but dad you know ‡ you have to admit that mommy makes better valentines day cakes
but well save some for you
this hasta do with the fact
what was interesting was sort of the leap that he made w which was connecting the fact that im going to be back for the first day of spring and that
will you miss your mom
he said
yeah ‡ sure we will
and he said
but dad you know ‡ you have to admit that mommy makes better valentines day cakes
but well save some for you when you get back
and what hes saying is
not valentines day
saint patricks day cakes
im sorry
saint patricks day cakes
he never mentioned saint patricks before then
no ‡ we had
we had talked before about the fact that i would be g missing saint patricks day when im in paris
going to paris and rome and id be missing saint patricks day
-uh but i guess he figured out that he would save some things
and so what hes saying is
its okay that we have mother for saint patricks day and you for the first day of spring because after all mommy makes better saint patricks day cakes than you would
so thats appropriate that she should be there for saint patricks day
and dont worry „ dad
well save you some
so itll all be okay
hes getting it all ready in his mind how its gonna be for various holidays and things when people are going to be going on trips
-um ross climbed over the banister
and as he did i noticed that the banister cut him right between the legs
and i gave him this rather startled look or concerned look and i said
oo ‡ right on the pi privates
and by this time he was standing up and he s looks me straight in the eye for a moment like he was trying to absorb what i said
and -uh then his face broke into a smile and he said
oh ‡ im built like a monkey
oh ‡ its okay
im built like a monkey
i dont get hurt
something like that
marky said
you know mom ‡ if we just clean up the fireplace this house would look really clean
he said this
he was in the kitchen
we hadnt been around the fireplace at all

you got the wrong guys knees „ ross

i rest my case dia
right ‡ and then we asked him what does it mean dia
rest his case dia
it means
what does it mean ro marky
rest his case
right ‡ but marky didnt know that
marky thought it meant that he was really tired and he was resting
it does make sense
it does ross
let mark say ross
whos talking
that was mark
and thats that does make sense but thats not what you said last night
last night you said that rest your case meant that you were tired and you wanted to sleep
i wondered if he were saying it in the past tense
i was showing mark a snoopys cartoon dia
one cartoon was snoopy blew gave uh woodstock the bird a little puff of air a little blow so that he would float with his balloon dia
and then -um snoopy lay down dia
in the next cartoon sloopy snoopy was laying down on his doghouse and the -uh bird came flying by with a gust of wind and knocked the dog onto the balloon dia
and the bird stayed on the -uh doghouse dia
and i i showed that to mark and mark said dia
first he helped him dia
then he terrorized him dia
-um its interesting to me because and changes midsentence dia
first he helped him dia
that was dia
first snoopy helped woodstock dia
then dia
lets see dia
this is -um july twenty eighth ha having lunch and ro mark was trying to say how much carrots he wants to eat trying to say that he only wants to eat as much as dia
marky said dia
daddy ‡ come up here dia
-uh i want you to show me something dia
and i said dia
mark ‡ -uh you have to do it by yourself and just dia
i said dia
just tell me dia
and he said dia
no ‡ you have to come up here dia
its a showing you kind of thing dia
they were from yesterday the twenty seventh dia
-uh mark was playing with a hula hoop and he said dia
think of it as a giant frisbee dia
pretend im a giant and its a giant frisbee dia
because i was fooling around with the car and he was just out there playing dia
and -um i was eating -uh some graham crackers dia
and mark -uh said dia
are you curious how it will taste with peanut butter on it dia
-uh he had already tasted it with peanut butter and he knew it was very good graham crackers with peanut butter dia
and he said dia
are you curious how it will taste with peanut butter on it dia
wanting to know whether i id ever had it before essentially dia
mark walked in behind me and said dia
mom ‡ im hungry dia
and i said dia
you are huh dia
without looking at him dia
and he said dia
and its not ross who is working dia
its mark who is playing dia
and im hungry dia
he was identifying himself because he knew i didnt look up dia
they have underwear on and he said dia

and i said dia
why dia
do you think thats funny dia
he said dia

yeah okay ‡ i agree dia
so -uh anyway ‡ incorrect use of the benefactive as a direct object i guess dia
the verb dia
-uh she was also calling the dia
-uh they were talking about things and she was saying dia
you know ‡ it really was interesting that mark said about rest my case you know dia
this was something that was recorded i believe on the -uh last tape dia
and she said dia
you know ‡ it was a perfect use of it -uh rhetorically dia
its just the only place where the rhetorical use and the meaningful use that is of really resting something both could cooccur dia
in other words ro mark didnt could use it rhetorically correctly but didnt have to use it metaphorically dia
-uh that is the idea of resting a case metaphorically was not something he wanted to buy into yet dia
so he wanted to use it in a specifically undergeneralized way but still appropriate with the situation dia
today is -um august first and -uh name has come to visit dia
said dia
dad ‡ im gonna make a test and well see who goes past it first dia
you run around and jump over this dia
you put a petal down on the ground and marand share near it dia

it did
in the movie
in reality
they sink into the mud
and then what happens to the mud
mhm ‡ and what do we do with it
no ‡ we use it for oil
oil for the car
oil and gas
what do you mean like mark
mommy these guys and baby these guys refer to the dinosaurs by the way
okay mark well
what about the tar
did animals ever sink into tar
when was that and that was that in the old days
oh ‡ the tar that they sank into
you mean when the dinosaurs sank into the tar
we know that
its you cant sink into it
like a street when they cover up the road with tar and it gets really hard
then its solid tar „ right
but there is soft tar you can sink into still
sure ‡ you can still find places to sink in
oh ‡ in -uh trinidad
sure ‡ they have tar pits there
they do
sure ‡ there are tar pits there
would you like to
yes ‡ we could go there and sink into the tar pits
sure ‡ we could do it
no ‡ you just go there and sink right in and thats the end of you
who the dinosaurs
whos hiding
no ‡ the pits arent hiding
theyre all around you
yeah ‡ and then sometimes youll slip off of the skinny part right into the tar pit
thats for sure
it should so you dont really slip in
no ‡ youll probably slip in
maybe we shouldnt go there
maybe we just shouldnt go there
oh yeah ‡ everything sinks right into those tar pits
theres no road
its sunk in
sunk in
you understand
yeah ‡ that would be a good idea
why dont you do that next time youre born „ okay
next time youre born you gotta be a monkey „ okay
youre hoping
why dont you do it for sure
no hoping
just really do it
just do it
just do it
you better let your mommy sleep now
shes very tired
here ‡ turn the taperecorder off now
they had bones in their bodies in the first place
because theyre not as big and heavy
doesnt have heavy bones
your doggie didnt have big bones
the dinosaur had such big heavy bones that it was easier for him to stay inside of the water so that he didnt have to carry around all that weight
how did what
oh ‡ thats when you have a baby that didnt grow right
you take a cute little boy like you
no brian
and you tickle them too much and they turn into monsters
well ‡ how else are you gonna do it
whats that
you get married to a dinosaur
whats the right way to say
very good
the skin would all parachute down on you because it would be too big
why ‡ wouldnt you have the bones there anymore
or i thought you said youd take the skin off the bones
and use it
where would you tape it
oh ‡ tape the cut back up
and what would you do to the skin
you go into it
oh ‡ really rough „ huh
so ‡ youre gonna cut the skin off a dinosaur maruhhuh and take it off and then c climb inside and tape it back up
right ‡ and then
and then the skin is gonna parachute down on you
now ‡ whats gonna parachute down on you
i think i shouldnt have asked
no ‡ weve got it all figured out here
is this to become a monster
is this how you get to be a monster
why not
a small dinosaur
which one baby
oh ‡ you mean like -um
thats stegosaurus
oh ‡ rough and bumpy
you might mean ankylosaurus
tyrannosaurus rex
youre joking
do you mean the meat eater
are they vicious
plant eaters are vicious because they hit you with their tail „ huh
lots of details
on which plates mark
oh ‡ those plates
what if you cut them off

and so its hard to change
but the new one is fun to play
yeah marky likes the new one
do you play that game too mark up in the rec room
so you never get to go in the rec room with mark do you
well lets ask mark what he does in the rec room

why did you call dia
please dont rip it
okay go ahead and do it to see if i care

daddies always tease their boys
at school or at home
where do you want me to put these up on my door
okay ill take them to work and tell them that my son made them for me okay
what are we going to do next
maybe some reading
we havent done reading for a long time
we could try to learn work on a book
put some of this over here
what is that thats a little pelican
a mina bird
my turn now
im going to go like this
i can
those are rossys
you keep rossys and you keep mine
ive gotta jump you now
yeah very sneaky
no you cant do that ross
after you jump you move and you have to jump again if you want wanna move again
you just jump over him and thats it
thats all you can do you cant go any further
because thats the way to play it
thats next turn
you do that next turn
but you wont have a next turn because im going to cheat and jump you
im not going to cheat but im going to be sneaky
watch this
one jump two jumps see
theres a sneaky way to get me
im not going to tell you
no you cant do that
thats not a possible move
you cant move backwards until youre a queen
a king
yeah right okay go ahead
im not going to give you any help
want me to give you a little help
you can put this guy here
youre kind of trapped right
yeah if you moved him up here then that would be bad move
you have to leave him there so it blocks me
im sad because no one brought me a present
is that right ross
marky thats not fair
what does that mean
doesnt he say
yeah he says
ross you just make your daddys life hard you know
gee ross ive got a lot of work to do
do you know what i mean
is that pretending
no thats not pretending
what were you pretending
i see
are there six more shows
the third eye
five and six more shows
no wait
how many more shows

how many in all
thats what i didnt want you to do
ross do you know how to put the under roos away
yeah just drop them in the right place
did you do a good job on it ross
do you wanna have any tapes
but i might leave anyway
so what are we going to do have tapes or not
how come
okay good
marky hasta have him first dia
well just go hide it in a place somewhere where no one will find it
where mommy and daddy cant find it
well how are you going to remember in the morning where it is
what do you mean
ross lets talk about whether you should give sean the sword
now why dont you want this
to be friends with another boy
you what
but -um okay i understand what you are saying
but then how is sean going to feel
well think about how you feel when other people have you ever been a kid and they dont play with you
other kids wont play with you
how does that feel
you dont feel too bad in that situation
just find another kid to play with
and then dont you need more that one kid to play with
what if no one with play with you
no one at all
what if your brother wont play with you
brothers always play huh
well what if there really really was horrible and even the brother wouldnt play
thats smart ross
hes a smartalec isnt he
so you think sean shouldve done that because no one was being nice to him he shouldve just left
thats a good idea
so you dont ever wanna be nice to sean huh
how come
well how about grandma
are you ever going to be nice to her
she pokes you
she doesnt always poke you
she likes you ross
grandma really likes you
she buys things presents for your birthday
what if she promised not to do that anymore
what if we got grandma to promise not to poke you anymore would you like her then
no but what if she really stopped it
no wait ross what if she stopped it then why would you be mad at her
but youre going to get old someday too
well how old is your mommy
because you should learn how old your mommy is thats how you should know
your mommys thirty eight
when you write on the mothers day present for her and on her birthday present you have to know how old she is
are you going to be mean to old people
just because grandma is old are you going to be mean to her
think about it
you have your own body
kind of but sometimes you have to think about other people like sean and grandma and
no one makes you and you shouldnt yell
because people ill tell you the reason
do you remember about god
do you remember god
okay god wanted people to be nice to each other
you dont believe in god
okay well then what makes you wanna be nice to other people
yeah but what if other people were nasty to you
and you wouldnt have any more friends
so maybe its a good idea to be friends with kids
think about it
just think about the idea of being nice to everybody
lets think about a world where everyone is nice
im not bossing you
im asking you to use your head
you dont wanna think about other people huh
you dont think about being nice to other children
well think about think about your own brain being nice to other kids
okay ill tell you the rules
do you want me to tell you the rules
then i should tell you beforehand
okay every time you go to a party with kids
listen let me tell the whole rules
ill tell you the whole deal
whenever you go to a party with kids you have to be nice to all the kids
when you go to school you have to be nice to all the kids at school
and when you go on a picnic and a boy scout party you have to be nice to all those kids to and youll have to be nice to all the kids you ever see and when you go to the mall you have to be nice to everybody
ross thats not nice to your father
your fathers heart is going to break ross
thats it and therell be no more father for you
well then youll be nasty to her and her heart will break
but theyre too old and you dont love them
well but if you dont love them if you wanna just be nice to me im not really old and i dont poke my finger in you and you can have a better deal by being nice to me so i wouldnt die
you do
but you didnt wanna talk about my things i was talking about
its not with your body
ross its not your body youre doing things
because you have a good little heart
you wanna really listen to the answer
wait a second
it means that there is an answer to your question
are you ready to listen to the answer
in your heart you know right here where your heart is
youre not listening
right in here is your heart
if you have a good lovely chocolate heart then you wanna be good to other people
if you have a mean hexy heart heart
do you know what were like
then you wanna be mean to other people
are you a
the grogg in raggedy ann
now if your brother falls and you have a warm heart then youll go and youll help him
you dont have a warm nice heart
you dont to be a friend of brothers
see i know you love brothers
okay no more talking about it
im not going to boss you ever again
im finished bossing
i know you have good warm heart and youll do it for your own sake and not for mine anymore
so thats the end of my bossing you
thats a dirty trick
are you going to try to do things so that theyll make me mad
no okay
no thats not the dirty trick thats not the deal
the deal is that i just stop bossing you and you do the good things for yourself

you mean at the toy store
i know how you can tell
the toys have numbers
issue numbers
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers
you can compare the numbers
but the interesting thing is that ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why i just barely realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys
im sure that there will be a third wave
you mean roots
an orchid
isnt he a terrible little brother
why isnt he as bad as i think he is
but he does understand some things
do you understand mark
he does understand
what does he not understand
no earlier you said he doesnt understand infinity and some other things
no it makes two infinities and eight
and that is an unreal number
thats a fantasy number
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number
because you could never really get there in reality
in reality you can get to infinity
right because youd have to live forever
so its fantasy
infinity is fantasy
good night

what happened at the end

aha yes
okay now everybody wanna go to sleep now
good night darlings
i told ross that it wasnt wouldnt be fair to cry just because im giving a trono to another boy thats adam just -uh he shouldnt cry because it makes me think that he doesnt want the other boy to have something nice
and what did you say then ross
actually he said
you know the set up of the double hypothetical just think what if
-uh and i never could have gotten one
how would that have happened ross
oh i see
i see
you think it might have worked that way
i see
now a little earlier you told me that you were pretty sure that the trono was for you
and why did you think that
and you said i w
you said you wouldnt have hided it or wouldnt have hid if it had been for me
isnt that what you said
how did you say it ross
because it was yours i would have hid it away
do you think its somebody elses
why do you think that
okay you say that you think its for you
why do you think its for you
and why did you think so in the first place
what was the reason
no the reason was that you said that i didnt tell you who it was for
if i was hiding it from you then it was sure to be yours because if it was for adam i wouldnt try to hide it would i
so do you still think that reasoning is good
do you still think thats thats good thinking or have you changed your mind now
who do you think its for
if its for adam then why not show it to you right
then i do show it to you
well im not going to show it to you so what does that mean
you you think now its for you
are you sure of that
maybe im just hiding it from adam
so you think thats a pretty good -uh okay
so what how do you feel about it
whos it for at this point
who would you guess
who would you guess if you hadta guess
is it for ross or for adam
youre not sure now
now daddy keeps on telling you its for adam right
so you cant make up your mind can you
well its tough isnt it
no way
daddys are not supposed to tell
how do you know that
you know something ross
youre right
its for you
it is
its for you
you guessed it
because if i hide it theres no way that i would hide something that is for adam if its for adam why should i hide it right
the only reason i should hide it is because i dont want you little kids to see it
you got it right
you got the right answer
yes son
yeah i know the whole story
its the first book of tron before there was tron
there was a trono
thats part of the the trilogy
revenge of the jedi
is going to be the next
is that the next
which is revenge of the jedi is the whole trilogy
well the first name was star wars
aha second movie
third movie

some some people in this world have
sit down and you put your mouth closer to your bowl honey so when you pick it up you dont have to travel quite so far

hm yes
i saw jackets
mhm yes
-um curly lamb jackets there were white blue fox ones for one hundred fifty eight
hm yes
blue fox and raccoon pieced ones
mhm yes
-um designer fox jackets and possum they were neat looking
mhm yes
two eighty five
mhm yes
here you can look at these
go away mark
and then there were coats for a lot
mhm yes
a thousand you know and some but the jackets were fairly cheap
what do you need this for
well you know how i wanted to have my coat done
mhm yes
i went in there to see what they were doing with theirs of course theirs were just lovely and all brand new fur
and they were all long fur they didnt have any karakul like mine
aha yes is curly lamb what youve got
no karakul
curly lamb looks different
curly lambs long
curly lamb was lon white too
mhm yes i though you werent going to get any more fur coats
-um that was your concept not mine
i thought when we went to holland we bought those coats
well i have that those nice coats
i dont really need a coat its just that i remember i was thinking of taking the coat i have
mhm yes
and having it reworked
i thought we decided about all this that we said instead of reworking it wed just get a nice comfortable regular coat
and that wed end up buying two of them and that would
nice coats
it would kind of do the trick
when i dragged out that one i thought you know this would be great
now i saw these prices now these arent typical prices this is a big deal
mhm yes
sale -um
ross do you want some fritos
go ahead
yep yes
here you you go marky
but i looked at these prices and i thought well if i took my coat in
mhm yes
and the price started going up too heavily
youd better just get a new one right
well i i think that
i you ought to learn more about fur
i felt that these are not for you
the fur i got
thats enough
you eat those and then ill try and find some more
the fur i got was a dreadful cheap one
the fur was cheap right
and it didnt last very long
mhm yes
i really dont think you should repair it
the collars good
hm yes yeah
-um while i felt my idea for repair was good
but it had a lot of sense to it you know
but the price might get beyond -um this in which case its stupid
i guess we have to decide what price
what kind of fur are you really going for
you know also that a lot of people dont think its right to wear fur jackets okay
you know your attitude toward smoking in public
i think a lot of people would say the same thing about having a fur jacket
who would
you would
i think
yeah i think id feel the same way
it seems barbaric to me
okay now we want cookies
where you you gonna get cookies
where you you gonna get cookies
theres a big box
oh the sack
you know what im going to do with those tomorrow with the boys
you you threw them away you know
mhm yes

he doesnt want them
i wanna put them up on the
okay mark well find something else
dont throw them away okay
i wanna give them to the birds
im gonna have the boys those cookies
to the birds because you dont like to eat them
well daddy took them away once so i took them out of the garbage and i thought we could want some
you know how theyre in the shape of hearts and stuff
we could tie them on the bushes for them the birds

each one was kissed by a sun
yeah one was kissed by mark the other was kissed by ross
do know why they say

well then well play with this -uh truck
see then well play with the truck
and then well play with the store okay
now where would you like to sit
would you like to sit in the chair or would you like to sit on the -uh
on the bottom there
maybe you wanna move this chair a little bit closer in here
cause they like they wanna have you on this little mat here okay
move your chair on the mat
oh okay
can you smooth the mat out a little bit now
oh well thats
is that better
there we go
oh now what is this book
ive never seen this book before
what does it say
nothings in that box
just the book
in that box
that was the only thing in that box was that book
okay pull it down
theres nothing in it
well what does that book say
ch chase
thats right
shall we read this book
oh this is a picture book
theres a little lady taking her cat along on a buggy ride
can you tell me whats in this look
oh now what happened
what happened here
i dont know
but the ladys very upset
i yes
thats her baby cat
wheres the cat here
what is he doing
and so what does she do
thats right
and what does the policeman do
but now theyve gotta try to catch him right
right there
look on that cats face
i guess thats a big pipe
a cannon
it could be a big cannon
looks like it
and wheres the cat going now
the policeman came through and what happened to the policeman
he fell down
i dont think so it doesnt look like it does it
and there goes
thats just the sky
this is the river
now whats happening
the policeman tried to help her get out of the pipe
or the cannon
and then they both fell again
what happened to her hat
you tell me
the policeman and the lady fell in the river head first
oh what are they doing
i dont know
does it look deep
a little
about half way up
what would you do if you fell in the river like that
oh really
oh i see
and then climb up there
whats the cat doing
they climb back through the pipe
and then the little boy gets the cat
and he puts it on top of the policemans head
do you think he did that on purpose
do you think so
i dont know
shes scolding him
that lady is scolding her little boy
so maybe he did do it on purpose huh
i think so
what do you think
i dont really know but i think so
now what happens
i dont think thats the little boy
does the little boy have on his shirt
thats the policeman climbing the tree
whats the little boy doing here
yeah its true
that isnt very nice is it
well hes sticking his tongue out at the policeman or the cat
i dont know which
maybe the little boy doesnt like the cat
what do you think
cause hes got the badge on
his hat
he lost his hat
in the river i think
thats a pretty high tree isnt it
she scolding
whatd you say
shes what
in the carriage
do you like that page
head first
why do you like that one
well it cant be deeper than their waist
youre in deeper than that in the pool
cause your feet dont even come to the top when you stand on your head right
so you could swim in that couldnt you
in that river
whatre you looking at
okay so did you like
oh wait
weve missed the last page of the story
they all went home
and now theyre ah both in the carriage
did you like that story
i know
we dont read very many picture storys
do we
well -um would you like to play with the other thing in that box
do you want
well shes she went out of the room
here well put
can you put this back in the box
i dont know
can you get the other thing from the box
why dont you sit over
why dont you sit over here
honey sit over here
cause i want you facing the other way
do does this remind you of a truck which you use to have once
long time ago
what did you do with those things
do whatever you want
do you wanna take it all the way apart and see if we can put it back together again
okay then
i dont know
well that should
lets see
how do we figure this out
think we can get this back together
remember where the things was
look at all those things in there
is that the motor
i guess it is
you have to take this thing off
thats the trunk
i bet thats what that other screw went to
that red screw
that was out
i know
but what is that called
member when you when we got a flat tire the other night
thats why that tire is in there so that when you have a flat tire you can change to a new tire
wanna take all the wheels off
i think youre turning it the wrong way
you gotta use the -uh
whats this
i dont know
you already had it unscrewed
try that one
i dont know either
well try
you wanna unscrew them
i dont know
we just have to do the best we can
i think we can figure it out
what did you see at the fire station today
did -uh did they go out on a fire while you were there
oh were there firemen there
andrea was afraid
what else is there to take apart
do you think well ever get this back together
could i use the screwdriver
you think well ever get this
and there goes one more thing
okay whispered okay
what shall we start with first
okay well see
no i dont think so
well i dont know
it doesnt go through there
oh i know
cause you know why
cause this hasta go on first
now okay
so what did andrea do when she got scared
mm okay
did just mr f and mrs k go with you
was josh at school today
oh he did
okay now whatre we gonna do next
do the sides
thats it
no because then the wheel fits into there huh
i think so
maybe the other
you know what
we have to screw this on to it
like that
you have to put this in
and then itll stay
now you screw this
okay now you do this side
i hope we didnt forget anything
now we have to put another one in here like this
and then you need a what
a wheel
now why did josh put the milk on his hair
goes the other way
whos somebody
oh ava
wheres ava from
i dont think this fits
lets see
maybe we need a bigger
yeah we need a bigger one
there see if that fits
yep i think that fits dont you
okay whoops
now this side
wheres some ones that fit this
what color were they
we need that square thing first
no that one didnt fit
is there another one
another color
how bout that yellow one
but there should be another yellow one
oh there it is underneath there
okay do you know where to put that
thats right
oh two more
where did
well one can go there
i dont know
we have to see what were left with
can i put this
that was the motor
so that would go in the front of the car
that went in here but was there something else that went with it
i guess that just went right there
suppose that
you suppose theres something under here that were sposta do
you know i
oh i see that
thats where that other yellow thing goes
can you put it in there
you know what weve gotta do
we gotta stop this and s start on this one okay
maybe after were all through with this we can go back to this okay
but we have to finish and do something else honey
see this
we have to look behind this and figure out whats in there okay
do you wanna look and see whats in there
first lets clean this up and put it back in the box
i think this goes over there
no the other way
oh it doesnt fit i think maybe we have to start all over again
well there was another one of those too
where is that
this is where the wheel went
oh there it is
ah yeah
thats right
youre absolutely right
weve gotta few screws
thats right
think you had it right the first time
pretty smart
see those little holes there
there we go
give me one more
now we have two things left over
where do you suppose those belong
i dont know where they belong
oh okay did you wanna put it back in the box
and then you come over and take this curtain off
or do you want me to put it back in
oh youre right
youre absolutely right
see i never could figure that out
want the other one
you were right
okay can you put it back in the box
and now youre finished with that
okay here
that was a su super toy wasnt it
now take the curtain down and see whats under there
this is a store

open your eyes
and ill come back
oh my
let me figure out what this does
lets go figure it out okay
lets see
what does this do firstname
lets see what it does
what did you make it do
i wonder if you hold your finger there a long time you can make it do something different huh
now what happens if you turn the light on does it
what if you cover up a different one can you see this one
can you figure out what its doing
how do you make it do different things
now what happens if you touch a yellow one
see some of these are yellow
push a yellow one and then push another one
whats it do
is it doing it somewhere else
guess thats it huh
i got it
its requesting a song
it doesnt do very much does it
you do
howd you figure that out
howd you make it do that
you know how
i see but does it does it do the same thing every time you push it
it does something different huh
she said we got five minutes to play with this
because its not five minutes yet
why do you not like this
wanna play something else
you cant play with something else until she tells you
did you like this or not
you do
yeah its got lots of lights on it
when you were a little baby you used to always say light bulb on
you would have loved this thing
because youd always say light bulb on light bulb off light bulb on light bulb off
you know that
because its not a real word
mhm yes
is it doing anything
what if you hold that one and i hold this one
what do you think will happen
what if we dont touch it at all
what happens if we dont touch it at all
lets watch it for a minute and see what happens
if we dont touch it at all does anything happen
its not doing anything
okay if you dont touch a button
can you see inside that hole
is there anything in there
see you werent pushing it there
what if we go like this
i think that works too
alright that was great
are you ready for the next one
let me cover this one
here you go
do you want to
this is the next one
alright you can open your eyes
oh boy

whats that
do you know what that is back there
nope not a snake
they live in the water
usually crawl around the bottom
you know what its called
whats it look like
oops sorry
sorry shock
whats it look like
it kinda looks like an octopus but its not
its a starfish
its called a brittle star
its a special kind of starfish that has really long arms
and its a saltwater critter
and hes just kinda hanging out there
i dont know if were allowed to touch him though i dont think so
probably not
you wanna go around this side
you can see him better
you can see the underneath of him there
see what he looks like over here
see all these little things sticking out that looks like hairs
that helps him grab on when hes walking along the bottom
and can you see in the back
that part theres like a little round hole right in the middle of him

you see the part that looks like a hole
right in the middle
thats his mouth
thats how he eats
you know what when you know what happens when starfish eats
he spits his stomach out of his mouth and his stomach wraps around his food and he digests it and brings it back into his mouth
they dont have teeth like we do
and you know what else
if a starfishs leg breaks off they can grow more
if one of his arms breaks off or gets eaten by a fish he can grow a brand new one

that his hair needs a trim

i dont think hes going to do anything
i think hes just going to sit there
see i think hes been chewing on this
see all the rough edges
sometimes they like to chew on stuff too
they can bite thats why she put the top on
thats why she said not to touch
because they have teeth
they can bite
mommy told you that any animal that has a mouth can bite you right
thats why we dont touch
thats why mommy asked
hes really looking at me there
say hello
i wonder what his name is
did you know that people used to make coats out of them
mhm yes
out of their fur because its so soft
but i dont think he would like it if you took his fur do you
well hello

youll scare him
you think
i never saw a chinchilla laugh

lets go look at him
are your claps making him do things
i think they are
his tail goes up
which buttons
see if you can get him to follow you around the room
how do you make him stop
hes turning
i like this guy
try not clapping and see what happens
like if you just press the buttons
he stopped
you got it you got the code
you love it
im so glad
its fun
try and see if you can make him go backward
he turned on his own
he hasta see you
does it matter how many times you clap
remember when he sat down
you did backward one
hes wagging his tail and shaking his head
can i try it once
and now im not clapping but hes still going
its still going
see if your clapping
well i dont know about the theory of clapping
now i couldve thought about buttons
okay theres a button
okay stop clapping and lets try it
something with the light in his eyes too
hello little dog
maybe its sound like
see now its eyes are green before they were red
theyre red again
and he stopped
just talk to him and see what happens
alright that was great
ready for the next one
okay ill take this one
okay heres this one
well what animal is he
a little otter
hi little otter
whats that otter
he happens to be on my head
well were not supposed to play with it until were told but you can take guesses
this otter isnt as exciting as that moving dog right
theres no mystery to this one
how are you doing it
well lets make up a story about him
what do you think his name could be
and look his eyes have a lot of feeling in them
theyre nice eyes
and he likes to sit on peoples heads
and he likes to go upside down
hes back on my head
isnt there anything else he likes to do
what does he like to eat
hes back here
can he swim
okay lets see him
oh i love when he swims on his back
maybe he has some seaweed on his belly
and hes coming back
i think i need a turn with him
lets see what hell do
is that fun to do
he enjoys my head more than yours
and what do you think i should do with him
just move him
hes like a hyper kinetic otter
look at his tail
and now hes gonna stop
look his nose is crooked
and this arm
lets see
hes definitely
yeah i didnt have a good enough game did i
hes back on my head going upside down
what if he were learn acrobat
he must have a few more tricks than being on my head
here you give him commands and ill see if he can do them
tell him to do something
yeah okay give him
pretty good
alright hes gonna be on the blue chair because were gonna make up that water
oh hes having fun over there
alright whats the next command
hes a good swimmer
now what
okay here he goes
you do the sound
and now
that was five minutes already
ready for the next one
for this one i need you to close your eyes while i get this uncovered
youre doing it
there you go you can play with this one for five minutes
okay there it is
you like that
i think its stuck down
doesnt it doesnt move
wow look at that pattern
sure i do
yeah you think these are the places my fingers should go
now would it go off if my finger wasnt there at all
see its going
lets see
dont make any movement
okay now go right next to it
okay now im gonna try up here and see what the difference is
so all the lights are flashing now
theres that
okay try that
you know im not sure what makes each pattern but it looks like you have to be in front of these things to make it go but i dont know if these two makes it go a certain way
like if we wanted all the lights to shine at once which one would you press
lets try it
and theres no sound now
im not sure of the code to this im not sure if what were doing is making it work a certain way or if its fine to keep trying
this is the key
now what if i wanted certain lights shown
all these sounds mix with all the lights
what would i do
told me what
okay i see
yeah i think you might be right about the sound
you guys having fun
you ready for the next one
ill cover this one up again
i lost my sign
well do that one soon first well do this one
oh la
can we t- touch him can or
dont take the lid off
hes not a toy
hes alive
but hes interesting
you trying to clap for his attention
maybe you could talk to him gently through the grate or let him see your face
im not even sure what kind of animal it is
its too big
a what
a rattle something
it has a hairy tail like a opossum right
i think
hi there
how are you
can you smell my finger
you could have a friend maybe
hes friendly
its not biting me so i think its okay to put your finger in
look hes coming to step hes stepping up
he likes playing with the tube
what are you gonna do next
have you been trying to do tricks
lets see if we can get him to go through his little his little
look at your little rodent teeth
can you see his two yellow front teeth
all together
he has two short arms
hi there
he likes you
because he likes to see your finger
he likes to sniff it and touch it
good idea
see if he follows you
mhm yes
i just get that feeling
i mean he cant talk i dont know for sure its a guess
because he wants to be next to where you are right
and i bet his water goes here
a tube of water or something or his food
what does spot the guinea pig eat at school
i know but
they have a big tail
but i bet hed like some of the same food
im not sure maybe well ask firstname
well we can talk about that when were all done okay
well have a chance to talk about everything when youre done
and now i bet youre ready for another one
i think you were curious about this one right
okay well let me take the cloth off
and there you go
well lets look
thats moving
let me see how many legs
one two three four five
i dont know what that is with five long legs
you dont think its a what
its a leg
what would you call those
a tentacle or something
and theres some stuff coming up
look at this right here some food but thats all through the tank
just things growing in there
this thing
i dont know
that might be just i think that thats looks just like see like that weedy stuff thats just
how come
you like to see fishies swimming around
there are things moving right
giving you the creeps a little bit
well lets look at it together
you dont want to look at it
you really dont like looking at it
it doesnt have a good living feeling does it
but there are living things in it
and this is the kinda place they like to live
well lets just not play with anything until were at the end of the short little game okay
lets do something else
its some kind of heater
heat comes up through there
our fish tank at home has a lot of action in there right
we have frogs jumping around and like we have decorations up
what do you like the best of the things you played with
everything except this
mhm yes
you just want to play with this toy again or go
you can try
there arent too many good hiding places here
under the table
its okay
some things are interesting to some people but not to others
thats fine
im sure its gonna be okay with firstname that you dont want to play thats okay
just like that
shell be back here
which ones
this one wasnt your favorite huh
well maybe we should do a different one
cover this one up
thats okay
and this next one is the last one and then well do the question after the activity okay
heres this one
you can play with that one for five minutes
so it shows you where the engine would go
and then the wheels go this go up right
yeah good idea
you have a bottom and it doesnt show you how it works does it
anything happen when you steer the wheel
how about if you keep your finger on that
this thing
what would happen
the back wheels dont go
so its like a brake on your back wheels if you press it
if what would open up
the doors
what do you see in there
let me look

oh my
dont open the cage
in case its out sliding across the room
now you cant open the cage
you heard her say that didnt you
what is it
i dont know
do you think its a gerbil
i think it looks bigger than a gerbil to me
i have a friend that has an animal called a chinchilla
it looks like that
its got big ears and look at its tail
it has sort of a fluffy tail
i dont know
maybe its a funny looking rat
i dont know
i think it looks like its ears are too big
it has yellow teeth
just two yellow teeth
oh my
you cant you cant open the cage
yeah i know
whats it doing
maybe its part of an experiment
and the chinchilla psychologist said can you play with a little girl
you cant go out of the cage
he has red inside his nose
he doesnt have hands
what does it have
oh i couldnt do that
is that how he scratches
look at that
sharp pointy claws
i see the teeth now
theyre little but they do look sharp dont they
i could not get my foot up on the top of my head like that
i think its probably good im not that animal
how are we gonna find out what it really is
well ask her when she comes back
youll remember to do
youll ask her
he probably smells you
i dont know
what do you think hes saying to himself
i dont know
theres his nose huh
what do you think hes saying to himself
that he sees a pretty girl
you mean me right
oh you mean you
i thought
what is that
he pooped in his cage
oh i wont say it
you wonder what the next one will be
yeah i dont know
it gets stranger every time doesnt it
a gerbil
i dont know
he looks so big to be a gerbil
looks bigger than hamsters ive seen
he could be a big rat
i just dont know
youre going to ask her then
you gotta be careful in that chair
no id watch your fingers
hes fast huh
thats a good name
oh what does that mean
what language is
oh sweet
what language is it
your language
all done with this one
well we can talk about that when you and i do our next activity okay
mm shell tell you then huh
and ill be right back with something else
its good you remembered to ask
i almost forgot
actually the something else is one of these
this one
wanna help me uncover this one
okay lets just pull this cloth right off
there you go
you can look at that one for a little bit
what is it
i dont know
i think you can touch it because she didnt tell you not to
and i think the point of the experiment is to see what things you like to touch
i think you can touch it
see what happens
what happened
what are you doing
just playing
to see what happens
do you like it
you think so
does it make a difference where you touch it or not
thats the only button that does anything
you want me to try
i cant get my little finger in there
nothing happens
thats just lights to me
i cant
well cover its nose
oh it didnt like that did it
oh it means it did like it
oh good
oh it didnt like it when i did it but its when you do it
i see
is that your computer
oh okay
so its your computer and im supposed to say oh honey do you want some help
okay ill say it now
okay oh honey do you want some help
huh oh
well will it make some light
you sure you dont want any help
are you sure its your computer
its not mine
its not daddys
oh how do you know its yours
because you opened it up
wow you want me to know how to make things work
whats that thing in the middle then
you know what that reminds me of
where have we seen lights that can see you and when they see you something happens
yeah and in bathrooms too huh
remember sometimes you see lights and then the water goes on
you put your hand underneath it sees that youre there
oh this is a face
oh you cant move it can you
can you push the top
i should do it now
oh it did something different
can i do it again
what if i dont take my finger off
you ready for the last one
okay ill cover this one back up
what do you think the last one is
maybe that one over there huh
the last one
okay lets find out
there you go
you can look at that for a little bit
is it an octupus
i dont know
theres a lot of creatures in there
is it an ecosystem
i dont know
how would we know if thats an octopus
the pink thing
the little tiny thing
yeah a little tiny worm
i dont know what it is either
its got tentacles doesnt it
count tentacles
oh one two three
five tentacles
so can it be an octupus
octupuss have how many legs
theyve got
like an octagon has eight sides
like a stop sign
so that isnt an eight legged octopus
it could be a five legged one but maybe its just a different kind of animal
yeah well have to ask her
she said when youre done playing shell tell you all kinds of things huh
a pink worm
its a what
a creature
maybe it does think youre pretty
do you think its pretty
the red thing
i dont know
shes got some explaining to do doesnt she
it fell huh
maybe its a starfish
i dont know
maybe starfish do have five legs
thats a good guess honey
a skinny legged starfish
it is a dirty tank isnt it
what do they need
or is it food
well thats true
maybe thats a kind of food these things eat
what we think is dirt might be food to them
its moving
i think it looks like something you would find on the bottom of the sea or something
i dont think we can hold it
you could if you were a mermaid and lived at the bottom of the sea
but i dont think we go in there
what is that little green thing doing
theyre together arent they
its trying to hide
the pink things hiding from the bigger one
youre thirsty
well get you a sippy cup for you when were done
this is the last one she said
its certainly been interesting
daddy has it
well get it after
what is it doing
i think you might be right
it could be some kind of starfish
what else do i think it is
i dont know
maybe its an alien from another planet
oh its not
i dont know what it is then
you think its a kind of a plant maybe
or a starfish
yeah it could be
five legs
i dont know
alright you ready for
well you know what well talk about that too
well talk about all those things okay
its waving its arms
its a its a starfish
dont you think it is
i think that is corral
and look here
whats this
is that alive
im not sure
looks like a sea urchin
im not sure
look in that rock
theres something pink underneath there
i dont know what it is
thats pretty cool
where do you think theyre from
the ocean
you think theyre happy in here
come back over here and look at this some more
i think that starfish is moving
is it crawling around
oh i scared him a little
did you see it move when i got too close
is there anything else alive in there
how about over here
look at this rock
or corral
how can you tell
what is that
i have to take off my glasses
another one of those things
im not sure what that is
dont know
its pink
what else do we
look over here
look over here
i dont know
maybe theyre part of something bigger thats hiding
i dont know
i think they like to live in the rocks
do you think those rocks
those corral things are houses for them
think hes out for a crawl
thats the grandpa
mhm yes
in there
i dont know
come on what
lets see what else we can see in here
is there anything else alive
maybe we can count all the live things or all the
how many
i dont know
is he hiding
or she
theres five
five live things and three rocks
what does that mean
i guess so
i dont know
maybe this ones
its heading back
mhm yes
or her house
show me
see green stuff too
oh i see it
the really dark one
mhm yes
what else
lets lay down
i wanna look some more
i never saw a s- a starfish like this before
do you think if you touched him it would be prick- prickly
but maybe they look sharp but arent really sharp
how can you tell
whats this
oh a tiniest arm
oh look here too
theres some
theres the tiniest lit
see this guy
look there on that rock
is that a tiny baby one
see that little sort of white one right there
you guys ready for something else

remember thats a secret still
that was a fun secret that time
ill be right back
yeah it was
alright heres the next one
oh my goodness
you do
yours does not do all the things this one does
look at its eyes
how did you know to push the button
do you like this dog
what do you like about him
do you like his button
or maybe a little bigger even
hes going backwards
how do you think he works
does he wag his tail
what does the that part in the front do
this part
does this make him do anything
you know what i like about him
hes quieter than your dog
that you have
and he walks
huh his eyes are red
red and green
sometimes theyre green and sometimes theyre red
what do you think that means
lay down sit up
hes sorta wobbly
you wanna have one like that
hes cute and hes alive

hes kinda fierce when you look at him isnt he
what does that make him do
he can
i hope not
did you have fun with this one
and are you ready for the next one
ill be right back
well have to wait
heres the next one
oh my goodness
ill put this one on the table
i dont know what he is
hello to degu

hamsters dont have long tails and he has a long tail
he would have a spinning wheel
all hamsters have spinning wheels
hes pretty cute
he looks like a cross between a gerbil and a hamster
hes got a tail like a gerbil and a body like a hamster
hes got very long whiskers
do you bite
you think he bites
she maybe its a she
not sure
look at the little teeth
he is
or she
i like i like her eyes
his eyes
theyre really big
i think that probably means that they can see in the night
you know what else i like
i like the whiskers
theyre very wiggly
yes he does have whiskers like a cat
this is a fun experiment you get to see lots of things dont you
this is alive
youre right
little guy to degu

hamster buddy
oh it has an itch
where do you think hes from
do you do you think
when he doesnt live in a cage where do you think he lives
out here
do you think he lives in the ocean
do you think he lives in a tree
how can you tell
so where do you think he lives
he bites
well its good that hes in there and not out here then
maybe he lives in the desert
why not
that kinda looks sandy
i bet he likes
maybe he lives in holes
what do you think he eats
or she eats
this stuff
do you think thats food or just something for him to walk on
maybe it makes it easier to clean up the poop
like a kittie
what do you think you would feed him if you had to take care of him
hes adorable

thats pretty interesting huh
okay well lets cover that one back up and this a questionnaire for you and its just you know answering the way that you know the way that you would answer the questions not what you think firstname knows

well have to wait until the
yeah i see some wood too
but were not supposed to peek
were supposed to play with this guy

this is only for us
because youre older
they said they could take firstname in another room
but i dont think he would like it
what should we do with him
you dont
you want to play throw the meerkat
thats a good flip
oh he almost landed on his feet
thats for the um
you were doing that with your fish the last night
flipping him around

he sits
what happens if you clap your hands
oh wow
looking for something to eat
i was covering the light to see what would happen
where is he going
come back here
hes gonna come get you
i see
i think hes going poo
hes going potty
touch it
theres one on his head too
you just like to see him go potty
he doesnt bark very loud does he
i did something
see it clap once
oh hes coming to get you
oh i guess when he sees you he kinda backs up
when he gets too close
say si
tell him to sit
i dont know
have you ever played with one of these before
lets see what if you
-ah hes looking at me
lets turn
bye dog
come back and stay by your heel
let me see him
does this button work
mhm yes
okay bark
i wonder what its front part does
lets see what he does when you clap
can we turn the air on in here
oh yeah is it getting a little warm
its really starting to get warm
okay are you ready for the next one
that was a more interesting
okay heres the next one
oh my goodness
now can he get loose or no
he stays in the cage
there you go
whats his name
you guys can talk about that
alright i guess were supposed to think of that
do you know what he is
its what they had in the library
remember theyre awake in the daytime
theyre degus
looks like they just put him in his cage
hi little guy
too bad we cant get you out and pet you
i wonder if he bites
you can pet him probably pet his nose
he probably wants to go back and curl in his regular cage
isnt that interesting
did it tickle
remember the degus are the
because the hamsters and the gerbils usually sleep during the day
and they wheel around at night
and these guys are the opposite
they like to um play in the daytime when youre awake
and then sleep at night when you sleep
thats pretty cute
thats pretty cute
touch the nose
look at his yellow teeth
hes got yel
can you see his teeth
theyre yellow
look at his paws
hes got four like four fingers
what would you name him if he were yours
youd name it firstname
oh like we used to read in those magazines
firstname and firstname
now see his teeth
oh they must have to cut them a little bit so they dont they dont bite
they dont get too sharp and chew
or maybe they theyre just like that
or theyd have kids getting their fingers bit
they must put the food in up here
hes seeing if we have any food for him to eat
this is an interesting cage
i wonder what they use this for
careful hes gonna bite you
did he did he lick you
he didnt bite you did he
do we think kittie would like one of these
firstname would like it
course you guys would want to hold him and hed get loose
and then wed never find him
just like the hermit crabs did
mm someone forgot to watch them and they got away
dont get your finger stuck
or he might go ha i got a free finger
he looks pretty well fed though doesnt he
you can see him in the mirror
no he
well dont put your finger in his mouth
hes cute
why not
very good
yeah thats true
hes not a toy is he
you can tell them what toys are
maybe they dont know
not much you can do with this toy except watch him
you cant really train these guys to do much i dont think
what do you think of this one
did you like this one
he said its not a toy though
oh okay
alright well the next one is one of these thats covered up
this one right here
do you want to help me uncover this one
lets pull this off and then see whats under it
there you go
well i guess youre kinda going to have to look around
maybe from over here
oh a starfish
wow it moves fast
okay ill be back in a few
here why dont you pull up a chair too
look at how fast it does it
ive never seen one like that before
or is that a
sea urchin
i see three four five things though
it looks like a starfish
look at his little legs
they stick on the glass
it looks like a it looks like a cactus
with little picky things
um i dont think so
i think those are just so he can feel around in a place
-ah i dont think so
we can ask her when she gets back
i want to see his mouth
he sitting his mouth is on the other side
can you see
are the little legs moving
like little hairs
well im not sure if this is a starfish
its an unusual starfish
that look like sh stars
so maybe this is something different
hes go hes trying to go back under his rock and hide
you want to come over here so you can see him
bless you
its funny the little cave
i dont know
what do you think it is
its not an octopus
because octopus have eight legs
yeah starfishes have five
this doesnt look like a typical starfish
look at this thing here
what do you think this is
its a thermometer
so you they can keep track of how the water hasta be a certain temperature
so see that little line right there
um these are the degrees here on this left side
looks like its about between the seventy-five and the eighty
so its probably around seventy-eight degrees in the water
its kind of cold actually
thats not too warm
but the oceans pretty cold
so its probably just right for that guy
what do you think his name would be
does he look like pets
dont pull out the cords
if you pull them out it will turn off the light
and then theres a filter
see the bubbles coming out there
and that helps keep the oxygen in the water and keep it moving around
and thats um this filters to keep all the junk out of the water
so it stays clean for the guy
yeah then they change it
yeah look at all that algae
thats algae forming on that
the tanks have to be
see on the back of the glass
that hasta be cleaned every once and a while
i wonder if its a boy or a girl
it looks like a boy
what would a girl look like
that looks what it would look like when its when its under a rock
if you were just swimming by and you saw that what would you think it was
maybe yeah
well it looks you know it kind of looks like sea grass too
like it may be a plant
the way the legs kind of wave around
so maybe thats the way it tricks fish
yes what was that
a clown fish
am i blocking the door
what kind was it
well we have the next one ready
did you like this one
are you having a fun time
theres this the next ones going to be this one
and then theres one more after that one
and then ill come in and ask you some of your ideas about some of these things okay
so lets look at this one next
do you want to help me uncover this one
here lets take this right off
there you go
now you can look at that one for a little bit
well try to figure that out
well try and figure it out
maybe its a game
oh neat
what if you cover this one up
do these do anything
well we have to figure out how it works
see if you do that in the middle it makes a sound
touch it in the middle with your finger
okay what about
if you cover all of them it goes crazy
okay take one hand away
lets just do it
what happens with one hand
okay now lets find out what one here
oh do you
thats you
nope that was you
so your turn
you again
oh that was neat
it went around in a circle
it spiraled
thats cool
did you see it go around
you again
oh me
mhm yes
its me again
ready for the last one
ill cover this one up
and here is the last one
okay lets play cars
come on
come on
how about if we make a tunnel for it to go through with chairs
by trying not to by trying not to hit the
here lets make a tunnel with the chairs
well try not to hit the uh sides
whoever hits the sides loses
each uh gets a point
so you put you go on that side
and try and go through the tunnel
and youve gotta try not to hit the sides
okay my turn
lets see if it hopefully it goes straight
got it
you bumped the side
so if i miss if i bump the side its okay too
ready set go
-ah crashed
i wonder if
i just want to see if itll do anything else
nope we cant make a ramp really
what other way can we make it go
youre cheating
-ah i saw you slam it to the side
-ah yes you did
sneak attack
why not
we dont want to break the toy
is there any stuff in here
well can you wait a couple minutes
we have to take a potty break
well we have to wait for her to come in and
theyll come in
want to take a little break
and well come back and finish that
ill show you where the bathroom is
do you want to try anything else with this guy
do you want to try and maybe we can bounce him off the sides
okay well try to
lets just see what happens when we hit him against the chairs
come here
come on ill show you
and well go
alright what would you do
it doesnt go over the trails
you have to make it go
i know thats not gonna work
well i dont know if thats so good either
do you think were supposed to finish with this
one more minute
and then well and then well look at that
look out please
thats probably good
now firstname why dont you and i sit at the table and ill show you what else were going to do
and then this of course is for you
its a questionnaire and if you just want to sit on there and fill it out
firstname go sit up at the table
and ill take this one
you werent done with this huh
look at that
now what happens if we both touch it at the same time
you like that one
now do you think it makes the battery do- does the same things all the time or do you think if we push the button it does different things
what if we dont touch it
should we see what happens
did we turn it off
do you think it can tell where we are
maybe its because we moved in front of it
thats so weird
they make it work
so if you stay away
did we turn it off
what happens if we wave over both of them at the same time
what colors are on there

and what do you think these are down here
and what are those up here
she did huh
that was a cool car that firstname had
what color do you think this car is
and this one
and this one
now if you had a car like this what colors would you want it
pink and yellow and blue
youd have a circus car huh
if you could go for a ride in this car who would drive
and who would you take with you
think a dog likes
would you buckle him in

well it can kinda spin sideways
kinda cool
like a cool movie
hes popping a wheelie
now what kinda car do you think this is
i mean what brand of car
who do you think makes a car like that
you think daddy makes that car
i dont know
you think that
it looks like a mustang
now what if i had this for my next car
why not
oh yeah
oh silly me
well i got
a hundred dollars
now what if i got a car like that and i drove it only while you were at school
you wouldnt like that
what if daddy and i drove it around
and you guys had a babysitter
im back again
theres one more thing
can you guess what it is
what do you think it is
should we pull this off and you can see what this one is
you were right
did you guess
she thought it was a fish tank
is it fish
its not a fish
what is it
its a sea star
thats crazy
i dont know what that is
isnt that neat
you just scoot that way and ill bring my chair over
i wanna look at it too
there you go
and then i can sit here
thats where he lives
mhm yes
i think theres another one over here
theres actually
i think that those are like hairs on his arm
thats how he feels things
uh-huh yes
you gonna come look at it from here
touch that thats very cool
mhm yes
yeah we didnt find one of these
how many arms do you think it has
you think so
look theres another thing in there besides the sea star
it has those little whiskers
its like an anemone
he wont come out
because he only lives in water
oh if he comes under the out from under the rock
that would be neat then
think he can tell were here
he can feel the vibrations of our sound
because of the way hes curled up
maybe the mouth is on the bottom
what color would you say he is
wow hes pretty neat isnt he
do you like him
mhm yes
now how many arms do you think he has
you think hes got five
look at this
look you can see his little whiskers
or feelers
he can tell where the waters blowing
because can you feel when i touch your hair
lets see your arm
did you like that
you know what that is
because you have hair
oh hes coming out whatever that
oh look hes trying to grab that thing
theres a little piece of something
hes checking it out
its like food or something
and hes trying to grab it with his teeth
yeah he did
oh weird
heres another one of those
you can see the arm coming up
mhm yes
wow theres ano- theres little pieces of this guy all over the place
come here
theres a teeny tiny one
right around here
can you see it
i think it
can you see behind there
can you see from over there
can you see anything
oh hes all curled up again
the blue one
thats crazy
hes teeny
hes still stretching out at the bottom i think
do you think hes soft or do you think hes spikey
what if we had a pet like this
would you like it
would you try and take it out
another good one huh
we like animals
well now im gonna get a chance to ask you your ideas about some of the things you saw
okay firstname
okay how about if you sit in the green chair
uh-huh yes
cover this one up
do you wanna do you wanna roll it over to me and ill roll it back to you
it matches your clothes
look at that
theres no engine in that car
i know somebody who would really like this toy
what else should we do with it
any ideas
why dont you see what else you think that toys good for
how about like this
oh it goes pretty far when you do that doesnt it
you should see how far you can make it go huh
road block
under the hill
up the hill
that reminds me of um one hundred and one dalmations
when cruella deville went over the edge of the mountain remember
when she was chasing the puppies
road block
hey somebody move this big road block away so i can get through
uh-huh yes
that helped a little but not a whole lot huh
i think we still have a few minutes
so what should we do with this puppy
lets see
so this goes up and down piston
maybe its the pistons
i dont know very much about cars
how many people do you suppose would fit in that size car
no engine
i know
i like surprises
do you like surprises or no
i wonder if we could make a slide to go down off the table with this
that has something to do with the fact that theyre videotaping us i think
kind of a noisy car dont you think
hey firstname
we only have a couple more minutes
lets finish playing with this one okay
you think maybe it needs something needs to be oiled
its a squeaky car isnt it
what does this say
can you read that
what sound does a e make
you just want me to read it
you sure you dont want to try it
its bendos
that must be the name of the company that makes this toy right
funky lights up there
they dont make too many cars that have lights up there on the top like that do you
and theres some here
some here
mhm yes
mhm yes
how could you tell it was a race car
sticky things
what about a number
what number is that
which is
what number is that
no do you know what number that is
one eight
after ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen
thats a pretty good thought
but i think race cars theyre just they number them so that when theyre racing they can keep track of
they have something to call each car by so that they know who wins
instead of a name theres a number
ready set go
number eighteen wins
somebody can
not everybody can win when we do a race right
but whats the most important thing when youre doing a race
that was five minutes
are you ready to see something else
okay lets trade
ill take this one
and you can take this one
ill be back in a little bit
what is that
oh youre so smart
good idea
hi timon
how are you today
soft and fuzzy i see
whats your name
hey wheres
wheres pumba
wheres pumba today
can you be pumba
yeah you dont look very much like a warthog to me but we can pretend
hakuna matata
yeah i like the lion king movie
do you like the lion king movie
well maybe you should sing one of the lion king movie songs for me today
dont feel like singing
well timon what do you feel like doing
kinda hard to play with just one toy huh
okay you wanna hide and ill find it
but remember we touch that and we cant touch that okay
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
here i come
where could timon be
not under the couch
there it is
i found you
you know that was very smart for you to hide over there and hide timon over here because i thought you had him over there and i was wrong
that was good hiding
because we dont have too many hiding places in here do we
okay my turn
there arent too many hiding places in here are there
okay is it my turn
okay close your eyes
you gotta count higher than four you little hinky stinker
okay close your eyes
i could not find a hiding place
but you know what it w-i was wrong it was your turn
okay now its your turn
i got confused
alright ready
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
are you ready
ready or not here i come
where could she be
-ah hah
i found you
theres timon
i found you
what else can
what else can we do
close your eyes
but wheres timon
can you find him
i dont know
um somewhere in this room
not too many places he could be
what do you
can you see him under there
you are
okay well
haha you found him
ran away
oh good
that was a good game firstname
well thanks
and you know what
the next one is one of these surprises i told you about
huh cool
this one over here
you wanna help me pull the cover off this one
alright lets pull this off
oh wow
you can play with that one for a little while
oh lets see what we can do with this huh
well i dont know
what do you think it is
you know ive never seen anything quite like this one before
what do you suppose it would be
well somethings making those lights flash right
so that means that maybe its some kind of computer or something with a battery in it
its plugged into the wall
so its powered by a electrical electricity thats coming through the wall right
did you notice that
when we touched it the lights stopped flashing
they started again
thats interesting
how about that
how about that
touching these makes it make noise
it seems like
or maybe it just does it on
well thats sorta fun
yeah it does sound like a telephone
you know what this reminds me of
whos a robot right
when you touch her certain ways there are mechanisms in her body that let her know that youre touching her a certain way and then she responds a certain way right
should we see if it does the same thing every time we do that
it doesnt do the same thing every time does it
so maybe its
maybe its not because of what im doing
it does respond to touch doesnt it
interesting i hear
uh-huh yes
what is that
its interesting colors
what colors does it does it show
mhm yes
what else
uh-huh yes
those are almost the same colors on a stop light arent they
i like what it does when you put your hand on the middle part
oh now it doesnt do it
mhm yes
its an interesting toy isnt it
uh-huh yes
i wonder what this is called
what do you think we should call it
should we make up a name for it
colorful does when you touch
thats a good name
right thats a great thats a perfect name
it exactly describes what it does
i would like to know that too
thats a good question
-ah ha
mhm yes
does that remind you of anything
oh thats cool
i didnt see it do that yet
what does it remind you of
you know what those are
those are called microphones
so that they can hear our voices
they record what were saying
did you like this one
well we could talk about it at the end
remember when were gonna chat about these things
but right now im ready for the next one
first ill cover this one up
we have lots of questions about that one
that one was pretty exciting huh
that was pretty interesting wasnt it
okay well im going to be right back with the next one
you like surprises dont you
not yet
its fun to take you to these studies did you know that
heres this one
oh boy
now what does that remind you of
does it remind you of anything
its a robot
its walking towards you
what do you suppose will hap
oh look it knew
its turning so it doesnt run into you
thats pretty amazing
so do you suppose it can sense when it gets close to something
what is it
what kind of animal do you think it is
its a robot dog
hello robot dog
you know i see some more buttons on that thing
theres one on his forehead
would you like to see what happens when you press the button on his forehead
looks like it goes to sleep after a while if it doesnt have anybody to touch it
hello puppy
are you coming to see me
im curious to see if itll stop when it starts to run into me
look at that
it knows how to turn
thats pretty cool
this would be a fun toy to have at home wouldnt it
lets see if we can find anything else to press on it
lets see you pressed this one and then you pressed this one
theres something there makes it wag its tail
thats a funny looking tail
fell asleep on me
wake up
thats what it looks like isnt it
so now what should we do with it
its not very soft for a puppy is it
touch my foot
you made it lay down
hey thats my arm
where are you going
yeah this would be a fun toy to have wouldnt it
are you coming to see me puppy
want it on your lap
oh his eyes are red now
i was noticing his eyes were green before
i wonder what that means
do you think maybe that means its excited
go get her puppy
oh are you gonna put it in my lap again
are you all done
so does it sit down every time we press that button
that makes it sit down and it goes like this
open its mouth up like its talking
let me see what happens when you do this again
wags its tail
shakes its head
those are the only three buttons i see do you see any
-ah hah
something in the ear huh
walking backwards
now its eyes are green again
what do you suppose that means
now theyre red
now theyre green
how do you suppose this thing goes
what do you suppose makes the robot go
but i mean what gives it the power to go do you think
yeah i think youre probably right
what do you think about this one
well like i told you before well have a chance to talk about all of these when were all done okay
um can you give me that one and ill bring another one in
thank you
you were ready for the trade huh
that was cool
this is kinda fun
get to try all kinds of new toys huh
are your eyes closed
heres the next one
okay you can open them
oh boy
there you go
you can play with that one
just keep the cage closed
well we can talk to it
you know i think maybe its a very big gerbil but im not sure because ive never seen a gerbil that big before
what was that
it did sound like a cat
the whiskers
well have to wait and see
lets focus on this one because we only have five minutes
and he sure is cute isnt he
should we try talking to it and see what it does
you are really curious about who we are arent you
i wonder what kind of an animal
i dont think its a gerbil
i dont know what it is though its awfully big
i noticed that
that was interesting wasnt it
maybe its a um
i dont know what it is
mm you know ive never seen a mouse that big either but well have to ask when were when question time is at the very end after all the toys
i saw that
do you suppose hes wondering why hes in this room with us
and not in the
in the place hes usually in
look at the whiskers going
know what hes doing
and do you know why
because some animals learn about their environment by smell
so hes trying to get some clues as to whats going on by smelling
i in fact i bet you hes more curious about us than we are about him
you think
i think so
should we give him a name
what should we name
firstname degu
hello firstname degu
hes awfully cute isnt he
he does have gold teeth
thats really interesting
look at how busy his nose is
and look at all his whiskers
mhm yes
well you know i dont think thats all food honey
i think its something for him to walk on
its uh its like cat litter kinda
well not exactly
looks like hes getting kind of excited huh
trying to figure out what in the world is going on
do you remember the gerbils that we used to go see sometimes at um at the pet store
the gerbils and hamsters and mice
at pet supplies plus
hes leaning back
look at him
it looks like hes gonna do a back flip
i wonder if youre ticklish
but i dont even think we should put our fingers through the holes because we dont know if he bites right
he is very cute
look at his little feet
how many toes does he have
i only see three
four toes
oh he has five
hm thats kinda interesting
even in the back feet
mm kinda hard to count when hes moving all over the place isnt it
that you can see they might be some more farther back huh
kinda has big ears
i dont think thats a gerbil
i think its too big for a gerbil
and i dont think its a mouse
but its some kind of rodent
a rodent is a mammal
small mammal
well we know that dont we
so when its question time well have to ask firstname- firstname what it is huh
no but he does have a mouth with sharp teeth so i dont think id want to stick my finger in there
i wish i knew a thing about him
ready for the very last one
i bet you cant guess what the last one is can you
is there one more surprise you havent seen yet
oh you know what
we have a squeaky door
one of the doors squeaks
it sounds like a cat
yeah the other family in before you thought that too
i thought there might be a kitten in next time and i thought surely she would have asked about allergies before they did that
oh yeah
nope no kittens but there is this one
wanna help me uncover this one again
oops without tripping
yeah right there
there we go
well you can look and see
lets see what we can figure out huh
do you see anything moving
i dont know
come over here you can see it from this angle better
look its some kind of sea creature
it kinda looks like an octopus doesnt it
i think that theres only one creature in there
i only see one
do you only see one
well lets just watch it and see what it does
its just moving around a little bit
can you see
mhm yes
but look theres little hairs all over it
see all the hairs
i dont think so
itd be awfully small to be an octopus too
i have lots of questions about this
oh i see something else thats moving too
you know i think maybe if you look around here you can see some more moving things in there
see in there
the wavy things
i wonder what those are
you know i dont know if i would want to do that because that might be stressful for whatever that is in there
i cant even tell what it is
this is the last one
i wish it would come out
i see something down there at the bottom
that one leg or one tentacle or whatever down there
its okay
come here
its between the two rocks see
between the two rocks do you see it down there
i only see three
mhm yes
i dont know what it is
i dont see any head or body all i see is tentacles
i dont know
i think were gonna have lots of questions for firstname
what do you think
looks like it likes to be right by that rock and part way under that rock doesnt it
you think
yeah it would be
you wouldnt fit in there would you
oh its moving its
its looks like its moving around a little
maybe we should stay and watch it for a little while sweetie
kinda blue-ish isnt it
i dont know what is it but im really curious about it
i mean i wonder if it eats that little pink thing thats over there
you know
because every creature needs to eat something right
air bubbles i guess
you know who we know who has an aquarium with fish in it
remember firstnames house
they had an aquarium with fish
its very interesting
i wonder if that is a light
or a heater there
let me show you something
it looks like thats a water filter thats putting clean water in there or something
see that
how the waters coming in from that machine here
and we have a light and its right there
that blue light
i bet that kind of light is a special kind of light that probably that creature likes
i dont know
i dont know very much about that kind of sea creature
and it looks like a pretty unusual one so
i bet a lot of people are curious about it
being curious is a good thing isnt it
well now its time to talk about those things
you were wondering about that
well lets look at my pictures and talk about some of the things before i tell you okay
but i will answer your questions
how about you sit in this green chair
and um
well heres the first one
oh what is that
you guys play with this one for five minutes and ill come back in with something new
what is that
a hamster
can you see his teeth
look at his teeth
see the two teeth on the bottom
what do you think this thing is
do you think he has a name
no firstnames had an ugly tail remember
this one doesnt have that horrible tail
mhm yes
mhm yes
what do you think you think its a boy or a girl
what do you think they named her
no way man
yeah maybe
maybe its firstnames hamster
do you see any any poopies
hes pooping like hes a rabbit
they need to clean the cage
what do you think it eats
see is there any kind of food in there
it looks like it likes to tear up that thing
watch those little shreds all over the place
it likes to make a mess
did it hurt
i want to touch its fur
well they got it taped down
i dont think youre supposed to open it
i wonder what that thing is
what could that be for
oh maybe probably for the water bottle
so theyve gotta drink water right
or do you think it drinks pop
or coffee
do you think it drinks beer
no i dont think its old enough
how old do you think this thing is
five-years old
whats your birthday there silly
shes not sure
you think shes shy and just doesnt want to talk
she needs to brush her teeth i think
theyre yellow
i didnt bring a toothbrush

and i found it on the basement steps
he hopped all the way across the room on the basement steps
he was a little bit dried out
but once i put him back in the water he was okay
he tried to escape down the basement
and i never really liked the fish tank that much because papa had lots of things like frogs and sharks

theyre no theyre much bigger
you could never put them in a fish tank

maybe its a girl football team
or maybe she plays with the boys
on the football team
she doesnt look like shes gotten sacked yet though
look at
someone tackled her
are her clothes dirty
no shes looking very clean
so maybe shes either playing catch with a friend before they start the game or she hasnt yet gotten tackled
so its probably early in the game
yeah that wouldnt have looked as nice
the picture looks better with it being white
kind of looks like a um baseball uniform though
she doesnt look like she has very many pads on
just a little bit of a bump there but
thats why it kind of looks like baseball because she doesnt have a lot of pads

you are you pestering me

okay tell her about your birthday
well his birthday
after the game oh but we wont have time
just gotta i just gotta just buy this last one
okay and then well talk about your birthday
two more quarters i gotta pay you more
all the money okay

oh my goodness you mean youre keeping that
you dont have any pockets though right
oh okay well see about that okay alright
so here are the triceratops home

they seem like theyre getting along pretty well
hi my name is joe my name is joe too

i cant believe it amazing okay
yes except last night they kept me up
i dont know why i thought they were happy with the trees
with having -um you know a nice place to sleep
but they were so loud
the neighbors complained
what would you recommend
you thought that what
so why were they loud
oh so maybe i should get a different kind of pet
really well how do other people deal with the noise
they dont the noise doesnt bother them
oh do you think i should move maybe
no take them with me and well move out to the country where theres no people living by us so we wont bother anybody
do you sell houses
do you sell new houses
okay because i think that would be good because my neighbors are really angry and they were just loud all night long
but youre right thats just how dinosaurs are
do you sell do you sell things to cover their mouths so they dont roar
okay so like this will this help
is that how i should do it and tie them on will that keep them quiet
hum that doesnt fit at all
hum maybe we could can he go in will it help if his mouth is inside this
ah it seems hopeless i think im gonna have to move to the country i think thats a better idea because theyre just gonna going to be loud i think
