*PAR0:	so I will try to steer her away as long as possible . 204080_207340
*PAR0:	but they'll always come in the kitchen and say they want to help . 207340_209780
*PAR0:	so stir flour when I'm baking . 209780_211960

*PAR0:	no I think there's there must have been a picture in it that she liked the most . 235960_240020

*PAR0:	and they will override me . 274040_275280
*PAR0:	so as you can see if I tell her something . 275680_278120

*PAR0:	&-um he's a boy . 316100_317280
*PAR0:	he kinda that's why she plays I think she started off with the boy toys . 317460_322960
*PAR0:	and then ventures off into the because she so used to he likes the rough stuff . 322960_327600
*PAR0:	stir it with . 327800_328280

*PAR0:	alright . 335080_335400
*PAR0:	and then does she have babies at home at all . 335600_337380

*PAR0:	so she had one doll that she was attached to . 354080_356160

*PAR0:	okay . 360100_360960
*PAR0:	so she decided she didn't like her old doll for a minute . 360960_363380
*PAR0:	so I told her that if you have more than one baby you have to take care of them both . 363840_367380
*PAR0:	so she would always take one doll and lay it down and say he's sleeping . 367380_372520
*PAR0:	and so she can go play with the other doll . 372520_374300

*PAR0:	I just want one baby . 377380_379400
*PAR0:	I guess she just thought it was too much work . 379400_380920
*PAR0:	so she would lay one baby down and pick up her favorite one . 380920_384920
*PAR0:	so yeah so she was pretty sad . 385080_388140
*PAR0:	well I guess it is hard to carry two such little all I'm saying I just looked at her and said . 389660_395580
*PAR0:	okay you're sad [/] sad [/] sad child . 395580_399580
*PAR0:	wow . 400120_401760

*PAR0:	you bought him a Ipad you didn't buy me an Ipad mommy . 449960_455460
*PAR0:	I want a Ipad so she's you know she thinks she's just as grown as he is . 455460_464060
