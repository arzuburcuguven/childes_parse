@Comment:	This mealtime takes place during dinner and involves Chi , Chi's fraternal twin SI1 , and their older sister SI2. SI2 seems to lead the discussion , asking Chi and SI1 to tell stories about school and other things. Chi and SI1 tell stories about school , they talk about their uncle who made them dinner , their Mother , a carnival they went to , and a few other things. SI1 also talked about a trip to the doctor's. SI1 talked a lot more than Chi , and SI2 did not tell any stories because she said it was <their tape> , but all three took part in the discussions. Mot and Fat spoke very briefly on the tape at the very end.
