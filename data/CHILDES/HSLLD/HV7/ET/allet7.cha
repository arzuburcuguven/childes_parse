@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	now the last thing we have you guys do together is kind of fun .
@Comment:	Time is 19:25
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play well together. Chi dominates the entire time during the activity. EXP stays in the background for the most part. Chi is considerably enthusiastic throughout the activity. She often engages in fantasy play. Chi also spends time experimenting with various objects to see which ones stick. Her theory is that metal objects stick. Although she is proved wrong when she tests two pairs of metal earrings , she does not revise her theory.
