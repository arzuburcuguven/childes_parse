@Comment:	Time is 0:22.

*INV:	It could be about dinosaurs .

*INV:	my zip is zip code .
*INV:	Chi .
@Comment:	Chi begins to write as Mot flips through the book. She Throughout the letter writing process , MOT spells out words for Chi , because she says that Chi isn't able to hear or sound out the spellings of the words. Mot gives Chi suggestions on the content of the letter , and Chi chooses to offer the author ideas for his next book. There seems to be quite a bit of guidance in terms of spelling and punctuation from Mot to Chi , but Chi ultimately decides what he wants to write and does so pretty independently.
