*PAR0:	hold on first it . 9740_16980
*PAR0:	&-um yeah I don't know how you put this back together . 16980_26300
*PAR0:	I actually think I do so bit fascinated with it . 26300_55320
*PAR0:	but he was trying to get the &-um little eyes getting loose . 55320_59480
*PAR0:	he's like working his way on it . 59680_60960
*PAR0:	so he was quite take taken by that . 61300_64020
*PAR0:	and &-um the baby doll again he's seems to have a fascinate . 64500_68580
*PAR0:	we don't have dolls again in our house . 68640_69980
*PAR0:	so &-um we have cuddly toys but not dolls . 70320_73100
*PAR0:	so &-um he's kind of fascinated with the [/] the eyes on the dolls for some reason . 73680_78100
*PAR0:	the way they open and close . 78360_79600
*PAR0:	he'd like to stick his finger in there and open and close . 79780_82860
*PAR0:	no [/] no [/] no [/] no . 82860_84640
*PAR0:	&-uh &-uh we clean the toys . 84640_85780
*PAR0:	it's okay . 85900_86180
*PAR0:	I know but it's foam . 86260_87400
*PAR0:	he might take a bite out of it . 87460_88580
*PAR0:	he will really take it . 89340_90780
*PAR0:	&-um and then the bottle . 90880_95580
*PAR0:	when I showed him the bottle he thought you know he's like oh &-uh you know juice or whatever . 95800_101160
*PAR0:	he was trying to figure out how to &-uh get the juice out of the bottle . 101160_104600
*PAR0:	so he drinks juice . 104600_107040
*PAR0:	he does . 107040_107600
*PAR0:	yeah I usually give it to him in a sippy cup though . 107680_109120
*PAR0:	but well he's taking juice in a bottle every morning at the moment because I have to give him iron . 109240_113280
*PAR0:	his iron levels are slightly lower than they should be . 113780_115600
*PAR0:	so first thing in the morning I give him like an ounce of orange juice and iron mixed together in a bottle . 115840_121460
*PAR0:	bit similar to that . 121460_122880
*PAR0:	bigger . 122880_123240
*PAR0:	obviously . 123240_123580
*PAR0:	so but he knows what it is he's . 123580_127360
*PAR0:	trying to figure out how to get it out right . 127360_129380
*PAR0:	Lee mhm was [/] was it similar to last time the baby and the clock . 129380_138540
*PAR0:	he was well I don't remember the clock . 138540_140000
*PAR0:	but yeah the baby he was interested in the last time . 140000_142420
*PAR0:	and he paid more attention to the food the last time too . 142420_145440
*PAR0:	but &-um yeah he's do you think he's more familiar with some of the food names maybe by &-uh you eating them or presenting them at home . 145440_154720
*PAR0:	pr &-uh not really this food . 156440_160680
*PAR0:	&-um you know he's eating . 161580_166940
*PAR0:	come over here . 168080_168980
*PAR0:	cut early . 168980_169420
*PAR0:	he's &-um you know eating still applesauce yogurts . 169840_176400
*PAR0:	&-um you know whatever we eat . 176400_178460
*PAR0:	but I kind of cook it a little bit more and puree it up for him . 178460_181140
*PAR0:	I wouldn't tend to give him pizza or . 182140_184400
*PAR0:	well I tried to give him pasta last night . 184400_186120
*PAR0:	but he wasn't into it . 186120_188100
*PAR0:	so no I don't think he'd identify a food by its name yet . 188580_194920
*PAR0:	how did you play with the food with him . 194920_198120
*PAR0:	just more the noise element than the actual . 198120_200860
*PAR0:	we don't like I say we don't pretend food at home either . 200860_203420
*PAR0:	so he likes to make noise . 203420_205860
*PAR0:	he loves to go to the cupboards in the kitchen and pull out anything that he can bash together and make noise with . 205860_212520
*PAR0:	so that was kind of how I was trying to get his attention that way . 212520_217620
*PAR0:	right . 217620_218760
*PAR0:	Lee you're a boy . 218760_220780
*PAR0:	you like to make noise . 220780_223720
*PAR0:	I played with the kangaroo and bumblebee and a frog . 223720_234420
*PAR0:	but it didn't really hold his attention too long . 234420_237300
*PAR0:	I guess because they were just sitting there they don't make noise . 237300_243080
*PAR0:	so he doesn't seem as interested . 243080_246000
*PAR0:	I mean we have some of this stuff . 246260_247840
*PAR0:	at home . 247840_248180
*PAR0:	but yeah he's more into &-um the noise makers &-um things he can hit together or things he can fit in his mouth . 248520_260020
*PAR0:	things like that . 260020_260980
*PAR0:	right . 261280_262340
*PAR0:	Lee no . 262340_266580
*PAR0:	how did you play with the stuffed animal . 267700_269640
*PAR0:	were you trying to make fun of it . 269640_271000
*PAR0:	make noise . 271000_272160
*PAR0:	well this one I stuck my hand up and was talking to him . 272160_277720
*PAR0:	but &-um I mean he was he paid a little bit of attention . 277720_280900
*PAR0:	but then he was like . 280900_281720
*PAR0:	get [/] get away from me the bumblebee he was interested Lee in the &-uh plastic the . 281720_289700
*PAR0:	come here Lee I know you can see the elephant . 289860_292580
*PAR0:	is that what you're looking at the elephant and the crayon . 292600_295660
*PAR0:	no [/] no [/] no . 295900_296560
*PAR0:	come over here . 296760_297420
*PAR0:	come over here . 297820_298980
*PAR0:	yeah . 298980_299460
*PAR0:	come over here . 300540_302700
*PAR0:	mm hm huh . 302700_307800
*PAR0:	what's that . 308500_311680
*PAR0:	it moved . 311680_314700
*PAR0:	did you see that . 314700_319640
*PAR0:	did you know &-um are you working maybe with Connor as well with like animal sound effects like quack . 319640_329860
*PAR0:	and yeah well Connor pretty much knows all that stuff already . 329860_333340
*PAR0:	so &-um &-um a little bit &-um probably not as much as I should with Lee &-um but &-uh l yeah a little bit you know if [/] if &-um we're reading a book or something . 333340_348980
*PAR0:	sometimes we'll make the noises or Connor if he's watching a program he'll you know I'd say . 348980_354100
*PAR0:	oh what's that . 354100_354640
*PAR0:	and you know what's what noise does that make . 354640_356780
*PAR0:	and he'll tell me . 356780_359160
*PAR0:	but I don't know if Lee is necessarily right there when [/] when we're talking about it he's but I don't know if he's paying attention . 359160_367240
*PAR0:	well he knows what to do with the ice cream cone . 367240_371400
*PAR0:	uh-huh you've never had one before like Peekaboo . 371400_383660
*PAR0:	and Patty cake . 383660_385020
*PAR0:	yeah Peekaboo we play . 385020_386860
*PAR0:	I'm not familiar with Patty cake . 386860_388340
*PAR0:	so . 388340_389100
*PAR0:	okay . 389100_389340
*PAR0:	yeah I don't know how you play that one but Peekaboo we play . 389340_394140
*PAR0:	and &-um this little piggy &-um round and round the garden things like that . 394140_399620
*PAR0:	and he knows what to expect . 399620_401520
*PAR0:	he knows you can get tickled . 401520_402400
*PAR0:	so he starts usually prepares himself before it happens . 402400_406840
*PAR0:	&-um alright Lee what you got . 406840_411820
*PAR0:	yeah . 411820_413200
*PAR0:	you read &-um books to him . 413200_414840
*PAR0:	mm . 414840_415040
*PAR0:	you have books read to him . 415040_416940
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah we read books . 416940_418440
*PAR0:	&-um I mean I read themthem to Connor and to him &-um and probably more to Connor but I do read them to him sometimes too . 418440_427480
*PAR0:	&-um when he sits [/] sits down long enough rightly . 427480_432640
*PAR0:	yeah . 433340_434500
*PAR0:	did they have the same the any of the [/] the books [/] books have [/] have the [/] the same [/] same theme [/] theme as [/] as the &-uh the ones [/] ones at [/] at &-um home the [/] the farm [/] farm one [/] one with [/] with the textures we have a Peekaboo but it's more of a animal Peekaboo and then a mirror at the end . 435260_453700
*PAR0:	yeah he likes that one . 453700_456080
*PAR0:	and then we have the Dr Seuss ones . 456080_459800
*PAR0:	but they're all sort of for older kids . 459800_463080
*PAR0:	they're paperback whatever . 463080_465580
*PAR0:	so he hasn't he wouldn't have seen those so much . 465580_470180
*PAR0:	but yeah definitely the animal ones . 470180_473680
*PAR0:	so he probably hears a lot of animal here like dog and pig and all that . 473680_485180
*PAR0:	yeah I mean we sing Old Macdonald sometimes . 485180_487940
*PAR0:	and we have a what you call it . 487940_493060
*PAR0:	&-um it's like a radio on the fridge . 493060_495840
*PAR0:	and it plays some of those . 495840_497500
*PAR0:	sounds like for kids . 497500_500340
*PAR0:	obviously they push the button . 500340_501320
*PAR0:	and it plays some sounds . 501320_503680
*PAR0:	no [/] no look Lee look you think that's funny . 503680_518760
*PAR0:	think he wasthe doll and the . 535420_538340
*PAR0:	food again I don't remember the clock . 538340_541440
*PAR0:	so I don't if it was there I don't think he paid it any interest but the food and the doll the last time too . 541440_549320
*PAR0:	and I think the baby bottle as well . 549320_550860
*PAR0:	he was trying to have a go at getting something out of it . 550860_554680
*PAR0:	how did he play with the doll . 555100_556660
*PAR0:	eh he was checking out its ear and eyes and tried to give it a kiss sometime couple of times . 557200_564420
*PAR0:	but eh yeah . 564420_565940
*PAR0:	and [/] and <that was> [/] that was about it . 566500_570660
*PAR0:	really . 570660_570880
*PAR0:	but yeah he's just fascinated with the whole eyelid movement thing . 571340_578200
*PAR0:	and you said is the major difference between just like not having Connor around in this play session you know for this session or did you find that he played the same bless you . 578200_595700
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh no he's probably freer to play when Connor's not around . 595700_602680
*PAR0:	Connor tends to &-um interfere with him or annoy him at times . 602680_607800
*PAR0:	especially when he's just happily playing . 607800_610380
*PAR0:	then he you know will try and take over or take something away or just antagonize him in some way . 610800_618340
*PAR0:	so this is a more free experience for him . 618340_623340
*PAR0:	Connor's not going to school yet . 623340_624380
*PAR0:	so next year September I guess he'll have he'll get a sense of relief . 624380_629300
*PAR0:	but [/] but &-um yeah so in that respect it's different playtime well I mean Connor sometimes he'll watch tv and let Lee do his own thing . 629300_638820
*PAR0:	but in general he's always around they're both there . 638820_645140
*PAR0:	so what you got you up the other ice cream cone . 645140_652480
*PAR0:	carrot . 652480_674460
*PAR0:	okay . 674460_675700
*PAR0:	so I can take off the microphone . 675700_677620
