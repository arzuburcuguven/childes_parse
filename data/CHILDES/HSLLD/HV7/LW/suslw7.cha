*INV:	I think your book is fabulous because you describe it well .
*INV:	and I love caterpillars .
*INV:	I like how you wrote it .
*INV:	and I like your other books too .
*INV:	my name is Chi .
*INV:	I have brown eyes .
*INV:	I am nine and a half and my shoe size is two and a half .
*INV:	my favorite thing is ballet .
*INV:	my favorite color is blue .
*INV:	I like climbing trees , fishing , swimming , and school .
*INV:	I have one cat one dog and a bird .
*INV:	PS I think you should write about a dog and ballet .
@Comment:	Chi resists reading the book , saying that she remembers the story and has read the book many times before. So , Chi begins the letter by herself. Chi works independently , while Mot talks to the EXP throughout the whole activity. Once in a while , Chi asks Mot to spell a word for her. Mot misspells describe. At the end , Chi reads her letter out loud.
