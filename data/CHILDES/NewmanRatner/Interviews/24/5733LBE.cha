*PAR0:	well he loves Bob the builder . 171360_172840
*PAR0:	so the building tools . 172840_174560
*PAR0:	and he paid a little attention to the dolls . 174560_177240
*PAR0:	but because we don't have dolls at home . 177240_179600
*PAR0:	but and the previous play sessions he sort of gravitated towards the dolls more than anything else . 179600_184620
*PAR0:	but seems sort of didn't catch his attention so much this time . 184620_189140
*PAR0:	so &-um so was he doing anything . 189140_194140
*PAR0:	and &-um with the dolls . 211640_213640
*PAR0:	what were you . 213640_214800
*PAR0:	what were you trying to have to do with &-uh with &-um well trying to get him to put the shoe on one . 214800_219080
*PAR0:	but he found that tricky so kind of lost interest . 219080_222060
*PAR0:	and the other one I was you know dressing it as the chef . 222340_226320
*PAR0:	I was trying to get him to find a hat . 226380_227460
*PAR0:	but he was like didn't show any interest . 227460_230260
*PAR0:	so he gave up on that one . 230500_231680
*PAR0:	that's why I was kinda surprised that he didn't show more interest in the dolls . 232620_235100
*PAR0:	like I said because previous times he was I mean it was d it wasn't the same selection of toys . 235100_240180

*PAR0:	so right . 242540_243320
*PAR0:	&-um and then was he interested in anything else in the night . 244460_247600
