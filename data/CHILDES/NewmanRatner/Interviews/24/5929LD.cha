*PAR0:	so yeah he was trying to put him on a doll . 66840_69620
*PAR0:	&-um did he ever play because there was a doll in other play sessions I think so did he ever gravitate towards . 70680_75760
*PAR0:	but in all the [/] the play [/] play sessions [/] sessions he's &-uh play sessions he's always [/] always liked [/] liked the [/] the food [/] food . 75760_80100
*PAR0:	I [/] I remember [/] remember he's [/] he's always [/] always wanted [/] wanted to [/] to play [/] play with [/] with the food . 80100_81760
*PAR0:	so do you think he &-um recognizes any of the names of them . 81760_86220
*PAR0:	some of them . 86520_87180

*PAR0:	but yeah I [/] I mean especially definitely the sweets and the fruits and the dairy stuff . 109100_113140
*PAR0:	he would eat . 113140_113640
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah I think a couple [/] couple of [/] of these [/] these are [/] are probably [/] probably similar [/] similar to [/] to the [/] the old [/] old play [/] play sessions [/] sessions . 113880_119100
*PAR0:	but [/] but I [/] <I think> [/] I think some of them are new like some of the kind of weird foods . 119100_122300
*PAR0:	yeah . 122300_122820
*PAR0:	like you're I think like the beads . 122820_124340

*PAR0:	he doesn't eat beads . 125700_126400
*PAR0:	they're too they stain too much . 126400_128040
*PAR0:	yeah that would be a mess . 128040_129440
*PAR0:	oh what is that . 129440_132440
*PAR0:	mhm . 132440_133860
*PAR0:	I thought he would play with all this stuff . 133860_136260
*PAR0:	but no . 136260_137540
*PAR0:	and you said you guys talk about animals . 137540_139040
*PAR0:	yeah . 139040_139860
*PAR0:	because we live like by a little farm . 139860_141540
*PAR0:	so we'll go there and look at the animals . 141540_143380
*PAR0:	and then we've taken him . 143380_144100
*PAR0:	to the zoo a couple times . 144100_145200
*PAR0:	so do you think he would recognize some of those animals . 145200_148520
*PAR0:	yeah I think so . 148520_149980
*PAR0:	yeah . 149980_151060
*PAR0:	do you think he knows the names of any of these animals . 151060_153340
*PAR0:	well he's a duck . 153340_154180
*PAR0:	I don't know about any of these other ones . 154180_155460
*PAR0:	probably maybe like you know what this is . 155460_165840
*PAR0:	I don't think you'd be able to name these are complicated . 165840_173980
*PAR0:	yeah some of them I think like maybe they've seen it the zebra maybe . 173980_177300
*PAR0:	but that's about it . 177300_179000
*PAR0:	and &-uh what is this . 179000_182080
*PAR0:	what is it . 182080_185320
*PAR0:	can you make the sound . 185320_188280
*PAR0:	what sound does it make . 188280_192460
*PAR0:	Brr everything's I guess a dog or a cat right now . 192460_197740
*PAR0:	so does he &-um does he tend to play with like you said he has stuffed animals but not dolls . 197740_205120
*PAR0:	no he doesn't but he doesn't really play with them because they're only in his crib . 205120_207760
*PAR0:	so only at night really . 207760_209400
*PAR0:	but &-uh so what he really would play with was are his cars . 209400_212260
*PAR0:	he has a lot of like matchbox cars . 212260_214040
*PAR0:	&-um and then we have like a big stack of books . 214040_216560
*PAR0:	and he'll just go and look at them on his own . 216560_218020
*PAR0:	he won't read them to us . 218140_219740
*PAR0:	you know like if I asked him to like can you tell me a story . 219740_222120
*PAR0:	he doesn't do that . 222120_222780

*PAR0:	and look at it . 232080_233020
*PAR0:	&-um and then we have like a little drum with some musical instruments that he'll [/] he'll pound on . 233020_238040
*PAR0:	but those are like the main things that he uses . 238140_239820
*PAR0:	whoa . 240380_240820
*PAR0:	he seems really . 241380_241880

*PAR0:	so we'll just walk down there and use the playground . 252440_254300
*PAR0:	so he does a lot of climbing around and not necessarily as much climbing you know playing inside right now . 254300_259900
*PAR0:	though he's running around and you can see now . 259900_261300
*PAR0:	yeah well yeah we're trying to wear him out so we can get him to sleep . 261300_263920

*PAR0:	so we don't have anything like that . 285440_287260
*PAR0:	he seemedto like it like when we were playing with earlier . 287260_289580
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah he was trying to twist it on . 289720_291820

*PAR0:	did he play with it . 316300_317300
*PAR0:	not really no which . 317300_319340
*PAR0:	is I guess I keep thinking he'd like it because we talk about it at home . 319340_322020
*PAR0:	but he doesn't I guess because there's other new things here . 322020_325700
*PAR0:	I know I feel't feel like there's just so much . 325700_327460
*PAR0:	yeah . 327460_327540

*PAR0:	and you know he's too small maybe he's like trying to be you know helpful growing up . 347100_350640

*PAR0:	and then he'll frequently check to make sure that we're there I guess . 379400_382300
*PAR0:	so he doesn't need us to explain everything . 382680_384720
