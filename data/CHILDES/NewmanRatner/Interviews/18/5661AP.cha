*PAR0:	I was gonna ask if it's okay . 0_1640
*PAR0:	if I start asking you questions . 1640_2720
*PAR0:	oh yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah . 2720_3560
*PAR0:	he's so in tune to me . 3560_5220
*PAR0:	he definitely shifted he was like . 5220_7520
*PAR0:	yes he is very even when we were sitting in the waiting room like he heard the door open down the hallway and looked towards it like he knew someone was coming in . 7520_16800
*PAR0:	and it's funny . 17340_18340
*PAR0:	oh he's listening . 18660_19340
*PAR0:	mm . 19940_20040
*PAR0:	&-um so let's talk about the different things he played with today . 21040_25100
*PAR0:	&-um do you want to run me through the session a little bit . 25100_27860
*PAR0:	sure . 27860_28620
*PAR0:	&-um he has always been very [/] very interested in the food . 28620_33100
*PAR0:	the food has always been the first item he goes to . 33320_36880
*PAR0:	and he's always been least interested in stuffed animals . 37120_40260
*PAR0:	I don't know why it's even at home . 40780_42940
*PAR0:	he has stuffed animals . 42940_43760
*PAR0:	and it's the least interesting thing to him . 43760_47860
*PAR0:	&-uh he loves books . 48460_50360
*PAR0:	and so but he's in some sort of phase . 51100_54020
*PAR0:	&-uh and it showed here too where he picks just a couple of books and wants to read through or look through same books over and over again . 54020_61840
*PAR0:	as opposed to continuing to go through the books even though there's more there . 61840_65760
*PAR0:	but at least he'll sit still for them . 65940_69220
*PAR0:	which is good . 69380_70100
*PAR0:	&-um you know he a little bit into the baby and what the baby could do . 70300_75560
*PAR0:	you know he pretended to d drink himself and then let the baby drink a little [/] little . 75640_80200
*PAR0:	so that was good . 80200_81280
*PAR0:	we don't have any baby dolls at home . 81420_82780
*PAR0:	so &-uh I don't know I guess he just knows from himself what [/] what to do with it . 83620_91560
*PAR0:	okay . 92360_92620
*PAR0:	so you know I . 92840_94700
*PAR0:	thought it was &-uh pretty good . 94700_96600
*PAR0:	he [/] he talks a lot more at home like he was talking a little bit here but really quietly and kinda shyly I think just cause it's new [/] new surrounding . 96640_105600
*PAR0:	but that's one thing at home . 106180_107860
*PAR0:	yeah at home he talks a lot more . 107920_109380
*PAR0:	yeah I can probably imagine . 109960_111340
*PAR0:	yeah I probably get a lot of that . 111520_113280
*PAR0:	yeah . 113560_113760
*PAR0:	so &-um well let's talk about &-uh what you thought was &-um his favorite thing here today . 115460_122120
*PAR0:	&-uh m I think the favorite thing is the spoons . 122700_127160
*PAR0:	okay . 127540_127920
*PAR0:	the plasticware things that he can collect well to him but I think I mean overall still plastic food is probably his favorite thing here . 128040_139820
*PAR0:	well in terms of last time the types of food he was playing with . 140200_144020
*PAR0:	and this time &-um do you think he recognized more of the items . 144020_149180
*PAR0:	either look or name . 149180_150580
*PAR0:	I think he does &-uh cause at eleven months old I mean he'd never had a slice of pizza . 151020_157280
*PAR0:	he'd never I don't think he'd even had ice cream or anything like that . 157560_163180
*PAR0:	so he probably recognizes all the food here now . 163280_167420
*PAR0:	whereas before I don't even I mean I think he recognized it before . 167420_171400
*PAR0:	but he was more just interested in gnawing on it and putting it in his mouth . 171400_175060
*PAR0:	so I think he does &-uh recognize the food . 175060_179360
*PAR0:	more . 179360_179740
*PAR0:	was he more interested in like the bottle than the cup because he's transitioning and like can eat anything . 180540_186100
*PAR0:	I don't know . 186900_188440
*PAR0:	I mean yeah he kind of just fed the bottle to baby and put it down . 188440_192060
*PAR0:	and he is holding on into the cup . 192060_193860
*PAR0:	so yeah that's . 193860_194760
*PAR0:	possible for him that he is more into the cup for being a little bit older . 194760_201600
*PAR0:	mm . 201880_203420
*PAR0:	we have babies use the bottle . 203660_205340
*PAR0:	were there any other foods that &-uh you introduced to him like what they were . 207080_211600
*PAR0:	&-uh you mean that I introduced to him in here or at home or well cause they're to they're not really . 212880_218660
*PAR0:	yeah what they look like . 218940_220140
*PAR0:	I mean <I think> [/] I think he understands that it's all fake . 220420_223460
*PAR0:	mm . 223720_223940
*PAR0:	like I think he I [/] I mean it he will at home . 224000_228640
*PAR0:	he'll pretend to eat something . 228640_230320
*PAR0:	he'll like nom [/] nom [/] nom [/] nom [/] nom . 230480_231860
*PAR0:	and &-uh so I think he realizes that is that all of this is fake food . 231860_237700
*PAR0:	that he just he recognizes it for kind of what it should be . 238160_241460
*PAR0:	but I and I do think he does &-uh know what it looks like . 241900_247240
*PAR0:	but . 248040_248800
*PAR0:	okay . 250000_250220
*PAR0:	so he didn't have any trouble for example recognizing that the pasta was spaghetti or like that . 250400_255640
*PAR0:	you were like . 255640_256120
*PAR0:	this is that or . 256120_257540
*PAR0:	yeah I don't think so . 257540_258860
*PAR0:	I think <I don't> [/] I don't we didn't really go over the spaghetti . 258860_262100
*PAR0:	I'm not sure if he would recognize this as spaghetti . 262100_265320
*PAR0:	but like the ice cream cone . 265320_266540
*PAR0:	I know he definitely recognized the pizza slices . 266540_269080
*PAR0:	&-um and the spoons the cups . 269080_273220
*PAR0:	well of course those are probably real spoons . 273220_275240
*PAR0:	but &-uh the bread the waffles I think he recognizes those for the types of food that they are . 275240_283560
*PAR0:	oops . 283560_284260
*PAR0:	are you feeding yourself . 284260_286980
*PAR0:	what are you eating . 287000_289560
*PAR0:	you eating something . 289560_292740
*PAR0:	ow . 292740_293880
*PAR0:	and have you introduced the idea of a clock at home or &-um anybody's . 293880_299600
*PAR0:	no I'm he &-uh he is very obsessed with our watches &-uh . 299600_303660
*PAR0:	and he will sometimes insist that we take them off so that he can hold them and look at them and investigate them . 303660_311640
*PAR0:	but we haven't I don't even well we may have one clock like this . 311640_315120
*PAR0:	but most of what we have is digital clocks . 315120_316720
*PAR0:	and he we haven't really gone over digital clocks at home . 316720_320400
*PAR0:	so . 320400_320980
*PAR0:	okay . 321180_321420
*PAR0:	yeah . 321920_322260
*PAR0:	&-um one thing he picked up this time was he picked up the keys and looked straight towards the door . 323340_330240
*PAR0:	and like the you know keys go with the door . 330240_333400
*PAR0:	so he's definitely making more connections &-uh as far as what different items do as well . 333400_342360
*PAR0:	oh thank you . 342360_344460
*PAR0:	&-um were there any other foods that he might be familiar with that . 344460_349160
*PAR0:	you showed him or unfamiliar with that . 349160_350980
*PAR0:	you &-um the peanut butter he definitely knows what peanut butter is and likes peanut butter . 350980_360120
*PAR0:	the peas . 360500_362760
*PAR0:	I we I don't think I think he mainly showed me foods that he eats at home or that he recognizes . 362960_368720
*PAR0:	I don't think he went too much for the different foods that he didn't recognize really like these things that are in boxes that are . 368720_379160
*PAR0:	I [/] I don't think anyone would know what they were unless they could read . 379160_382960
*PAR0:	so . 382960_383780
*PAR0:	and he didn't seem to he did seem to go for the foods that he recognized versus things that he didn't wouldn't know . 383780_393900
*PAR0:	so . 393900_394920
*PAR0:	and I think actually in turn I went with the foods that I knew he would recognize . 394920_401260
*PAR0:	I don't think I really picked up things that I didn't think he would recognize . 401260_405360
*PAR0:	&-uh I don't I didn't do it consciously . 405360_407920
*PAR0:	I just yeah [/] yeah just picked up things . 407940_411100
*PAR0:	I thought he would be familiar . 411100_412740
*PAR0:	with so for example &-um like he's picking up like the round . 412740_418860
*PAR0:	do you think he thinks they're more like blocks or peanut butter and soup or &-uh it's hard to say . 419020_427080
*PAR0:	I think . 427180_427700
*PAR0:	yeah I think he recognizes things like this . 427700_431860
*PAR0:	I think he knows he can't eat them . 431920_433140
*PAR0:	he's not quite sure what to do with them . 433200_434620
*PAR0:	so he's just kind of ignores them . 434740_437200
*PAR0:	so &-um andthen you introduce them with their names . 437520_443640
*PAR0:	yeah I bet he didn't you know he just didn't seem to latch onto them . 444300_447720
*PAR0:	mhm . 447840_448020
*PAR0:	but like I told him this was peanut butter . 448080_449720
*PAR0:	and he was just kinda like . 449720_450360
*PAR0:	eh right it's not I think . 450360_452960
*PAR0:	and I again I think it's because he realizes that it's fake and that he is not actually gonna get peanut butter out of here . 452960_459560
*PAR0:	so &-uh so I think that he I'll I and [/] and he can't chew on it . 459560_467340
*PAR0:	so things like spoons or bottles that he can chew on even though he knows that he's not getting anything . 467760_474340
*PAR0:	&-uh thank you pretending that's right . 475140_478240
*PAR0:	&-uh what about the animals that he did play with . 479220_482460
*PAR0:	did he &-um does he were there ones that he liked more or ones that you felt were more familiar to him . 482580_489980
*PAR0:	&-um I think most of the animals that we were looking at that he liked the best were ones that we read about in books because we've [/] we've we read a lot of books . 490400_498780
*PAR0:	and I you know we have like [/] like this book we have a lot of the touch and feel type books . 498780_504460
*PAR0:	and one of them has a zebra in it . 504460_505940
*PAR0:	and so . 505940_506260
*PAR0:	I think he was most attracted to the [/] the animals that he recognizes from his books because we don't have most of these stuffed animals at home . 506260_518520
*PAR0:	which ones are the ones that &-um he played with . 518520_521620
*PAR0:	today . 521620_522320
*PAR0:	&-uh he played with the zebra a little bit and the seal or he at least identified them . 522320_527480
*PAR0:	and we looked at the frog and the goose . 527880_530660
*PAR0:	&-uh and then after that he kind of lost interest . 531920_534020
*PAR0:	but yeah I think and those are again all they're all [/] all ones that we have in books . 534560_541360
*PAR0:	which books do you . 541960_542960
*PAR0:	if you don't mind telling me which books have them in the &-um we have one which one has the zebra in it . 542960_548980
*PAR0:	we have a couple that &-um one is like at the zoo and the one that has the zebra in it . 548980_557880
*PAR0:	&-um and we have one that is sea creatures that has &-uh seals in it . 557880_565020
*PAR0:	I the goose . 566140_566840
*PAR0:	I'm I don't know if we actually have a goose one or if we seen geese actual geese walking around . 566840_572220
*PAR0:	so that might be why he knows that's cool geese . 572360_574920
*PAR0:	and then we have &-um we have a book that's called touch and feel wild animals that has a frog in it . 574920_581320
*PAR0:	and then a little frog has like cause it's touch and feel cause it's the one with sticky fingers on it . 581320_585440
*PAR0:	but eww <I know> [/] I know . 585440_588040
*PAR0:	yeah eww does the frog you yeah . 588040_608020
*PAR0:	are you playing with the baby today . 608020_610980
*PAR0:	&-um oh I was just ask because he picked up the cup and started pretending to drink it . 611480_617580
*PAR0:	I was just asking him . 617660_618800
*PAR0:	you know . 618800_619080
*PAR0:	oh well <who else> [/] who else would wanna drink it and . 619080_621740
*PAR0:	or who would wanna drink from a sippy cup . 621740_623400
*PAR0:	and he didn't offer it to me . 623520_624700
*PAR0:	he offered it to the baby . 624760_625620
*PAR0:	so and that was okay . 626020_627100
*PAR0:	yeah . 627580_628080
*PAR0:	&-uh and he seemed to pretend to kind of feed the baby . 628080_633520
*PAR0:	and then toward kind of towards the end we were getting to maybe trying to put the baby's shoes on . 633840_639920
*PAR0:	but he didn't &-uh didn't jump right on that . 640000_643240
*PAR0:	but we because I mean he knows for himself . 643520_646180
*PAR0:	he knows his different articles of clothing . 646180_649320
*PAR0:	knows his shoes and his shirt and that type of thing . 649600_651520
*PAR0:	so &-uh I was thinking maybe he would go for trying to kind of dress the baby a little bit . 651520_658180
*PAR0:	but he didn't exactly show interest in it . 658180_660880
*PAR0:	well we might have gotten there but I [/] I think and I honestly think the reason he didn't wanna do it was more because he was he didn't have the hands to do it because he's made this little collection here that he's holding on to for no matter what else he does . 661180_678960
*PAR0:	yeah he's been doing he did that in the &-uh video room too . 678960_681820
*PAR0:	just I [/] I don't know if it's just a phase he's going through or that all kids go through I think I've [/] I've heard some kids are [/] are like collectors . 681820_691260
*PAR0:	and they you know because he we he does a little music class . 691260_695700
*PAR0:	and they'll bring out like little shaker eggs or something . 695700_698400
*PAR0:	and he'll be the kid he wants to you know pick up as many as he can hold . 698400_702260
*PAR0:	and you know here he'll flip the pages . 702260_705000
*PAR0:	so yeah he is a bit of a collector . 705000_706920
*PAR0:	so I think that's also why he likes these . 706920_708480
*PAR0:	things because he can get a bunch in his hands all at the same time . 708480_712820
*PAR0:	so [/] so he really likes books . 712820_715820
*PAR0:	he really likes books . 715820_717660
*PAR0:	he has a huge bookcase full of books . 717660_720200
*PAR0:	and almost every single day we empty it out going [/] going through all the books . 720200_726140
*PAR0:	so are these &-um new books . 726140_729420
*PAR0:	the ones &-uh here that he hasn't read . 729420_731580
*PAR0:	yeah we haven't all of these I think are ones we haven't read . 731580_737420
*PAR0:	but we've read similar ones to it . 737420_740460
*PAR0:	like we [/] we had a caring cat's book . 740460_743800
*PAR0:	but <it's not> [/] it's not this one like he's read where's baby's belly button . 743800_747080
*PAR0:	but he hasn't read the Peekaboo baby . 747080_750420
*PAR0:	&-um we actually have good night moon but not the counting book . 750420_753880
*PAR0:	okay . 754360_754660
*PAR0:	so I think it was different but familiar in that way . 754720_758960
*PAR0:	<we have a> [/] we have a touch [/] touch and [/] and feel [/] feel book [/] book . 759060_761640
*PAR0:	but [/] but it's [/] <it's not not it's> [/] it's not [/] not this [/] this one [/] one . 761640_763620
*PAR0:	no . 763660_765040
*PAR0:	or we [/] we have [/] have several [/] several touch and feel books . 765040_766520
*PAR0:	and we have some Dr Seuss books and that type of thing . 766520_770280
*PAR0:	just similar &-um you know mainly the pictures because after the first [/] first after couple the of pages &-um the numbers that they're using for things are not the same as what they are in the book . 770280_794180
*PAR0:	like in the book . 794180_794740
*PAR0:	there's only a pair of Mittens and here there's eight Mittens and <you know but> [/] you know but I but he recognizes the pictures because they're all directly drawn out of the book and then placed on these pages . 794740_808440
*PAR0:	and then they kind of start and end with the same scene picture . 808440_812820
*PAR0:	so I definitely think he recognized that . 812820_815900
*PAR0:	and I we always do and a quiet old . 815900_819160
*PAR0:	lady whispering . 819160_819760
*PAR0:	and he'll go hush . 819760_820900
*PAR0:	and he did it . 820900_821520
*PAR0:	he did it here even though it was out of context of the rhythm of the book . 821520_826840
*PAR0:	so <that was> [/] that was pretty good . 826840_828460
*PAR0:	I guess he would he definitely recognized it so . 828460_831740
*PAR0:	well d were you calling attention to certain things like that . 832200_835220
*PAR0:	weren't that weren't in this rendition of the book to kind of help him . 835220_840000
*PAR0:	remember I think I did when we opened this first page I told him . 840000_845660
*PAR0:	I'm like . 845660_845920
*PAR0:	look it's the great green room . 845920_847340
*PAR0:	because the book starts off in the great green room there was . 847340_850560
*PAR0:	and then it goes on to list of the things . 850560_852220
*PAR0:	so I you know I pointed out to him that this was the great green room . 852220_855340
*PAR0:	and so maybe that gave him the frame of reference . 855340_859360
*PAR0:	okay . 859360_859500
*PAR0:	but then throughout then you stuck to what the book was saying for . 859500_862680
*PAR0:	<I did> [/] I did stick to what the book was saying for the rest . 862680_865500
*PAR0:	so &-um so they talked about Mittens and what were the other familiar things that you think regardless of the number . 865500_872420
*PAR0:	oh the &-uh whoop the cows and the three little bear . 872420_876920
*PAR0:	I think I mean I think all of it there's bowls of mush and telephones and socks seven socks though that doesn't make any sense . 877040_885980
*PAR0:	they need an extra sock . 886060_887480
*PAR0:	well you always miss <you always lose one> [/] you always lose one . 887780_890080
*PAR0:	it's true . 890080_890840
*PAR0:	&-um and I know balloons . 891420_893800
*PAR0:	he really likes the red balloons . 893880_896540
*PAR0:	but there's only one red balloon in the book . 896540_899180
*PAR0:	not nine . 899180_900540
*PAR0:	yeah I [/] I really I think he recognized all of it . 900540_903960
*PAR0:	all of it . 903960_906140
*PAR0:	that's right . 906140_907400
*PAR0:	&-uh and then they yeah like . 907400_910160
*PAR0:	I said they . 910160_910560
*PAR0:	and then they end the book with the same picture like honey a little tired . 910560_919760
*PAR0:	we do play Peekaboo and he'll play it . 919760_930680
*PAR0:	he'll &-uh you know pick [/] pick up [/] up blankets [/] blankets . 930680_933040
*PAR0:	he'll [/] he'll initiate [/] initiate the [/] the game [/] game . 933040_934320
*PAR0:	oh [/] oh &-um &-um you [/] you know [/] know picking up blankets or whatever he can find and or go like going behind a curtain that type of thing . 934460_942120
*PAR0:	and he'll [/] he'll play Peekaboo and he'll [/] he'll initiate it . 942160_944920
*PAR0:	&-um so it's a lot . 945520_947060
*PAR0:	he actually does a lot of what the book tells you . 947060_949140
*PAR0:	yeah . 949140_949360
*PAR0:	yep . 950020_950320
*PAR0:	yeah . 951380_951900
*PAR0:	he &-uh he l he loves lift the flap books . 951900_956800
*PAR0:	he does find those very exciting . 956800_960280
*PAR0:	&-um and yeah we do [/] <do a> [/] do a lot of Peekaboo and I think he's familiar with some of the objects like you know balls . 960280_968600
*PAR0:	he definitely has a [/] a good understanding of balls and hats and curtains . 968800_977440
*PAR0:	I thought it was kind of neat that when we went through it a second time he was much faster because the flaps don't all lift from the bottom . 977440_986400
*PAR0:	some of them lift from the top . 986400_988380
*PAR0:	and some of them have kind of an angular &-uh turn to them . 988380_992640
*PAR0:	and the [/] the first time through he was he'd try and pull it from the bottom on all of them . 992640_996520
*PAR0:	but then the second time through he kind of was able to go more quickly to where they pulled down from . 996520_1002080
*PAR0:	so he I guess the maybe that's why he likes to look at books a bunch of different times because he gets more out of it each time . 1002080_1010200
*PAR0:	so he remembers things . 1010200_1012320
*PAR0:	did you give mommy the baby . 1013720_1015660
*PAR0:	thank you and . 1016120_1019800
*PAR0:	then was there another book that you read . 1019800_1021760
*PAR0:	&-um what we did . 1021880_1023100
*PAR0:	oh we put we read the put me in the zoo book . 1023100_1028480
*PAR0:	which he kind of lost interest in partway through . 1028480_1034660
*PAR0:	but he would he stayed into it as long as I was asking him questions about what the different color spots were . 1034660_1042320
*PAR0:	but I think perhaps he was just less able to follow [/] follow this one . 1042320_1051420
*PAR0:	whoop . 1051420_1053080
*PAR0:	there were probably some words in there that were different . 1053080_1055240
*PAR0:	yeah it's &-uh and a little bit I guess it's a little bit wordier than say the Peekaboo baby where every [/] every page has variations on the same phrasing whereas this one was kind of changing everyone although you're more interested in it . 1055240_1075540
*PAR0:	now see different spots . 1075540_1078140
*PAR0:	and we've never been about colors and what are . 1078140_1088460
*PAR0:	yeah it's it says that it's &-um a book of colors . 1088480_1091480
*PAR0:	and so it's &-uh this animal that wants to be in the zoo . 1092520_1096280
*PAR0:	and they kick him out . 1096360_1097100
*PAR0:	so they he [/] he but he's showing the children that they would put him in if they could see what he could do which is change the color of his spots every [/] every time he wants to . 1097100_1107480
*PAR0:	oh okay . 1108200_1108680
*PAR0:	so he [/] he change . 1108800_1109660
*PAR0:	so . 1109660_1109960
*PAR0:	yeah . 1109960_1110620
*PAR0:	so it goes through and does little rhymes and leads up to how what color the spots are . 1110620_1116500
*PAR0:	does he know those colors . 1116940_1118300
*PAR0:	mhm . 1118500_1118760
*PAR0:	yep . 1119360_1119900
*PAR0:	he knows &-uh he basically knows like if you have a the what the basic crayola marker box he knows all his basic colors . 1120080_1131200
*PAR0:	it's like when we got to they call their spots violet . 1131200_1134280
*PAR0:	and I asked him what color it was . 1134280_1135640
*PAR0:	and he said . 1135640_1135980
*PAR0:	purple . 1135980_1136320
*PAR0:	and you know I figure that's pretty . 1136320_1141320
*PAR0:	much the same thing . 1141320_1142200
*PAR0:	so . 1142200_1142600
*PAR0:	yeah so he knows all the colors . 1142600_1144600
*PAR0:	&-um and now and I don't think he knows what that animal is because I think it's a made up animal . 1144600_1151580
*PAR0:	but does he have a favorite color . 1151580_1153340
*PAR0:	&-um when [/] when we very first started talking about colors he was obsessed with Yellow he I mean &-uh &-uh kind of before he understood exactly how colors worked . 1153920_1170200
*PAR0:	&-uh he would say everything was yellow . 1170200_1172360
*PAR0:	you'd ask him what color that red sweater was . 1172520_1175320
*PAR0:	and he'd say yellow because he knew it was a color . 1175380_1178080
*PAR0:	and he knew you were asking about a color . 1178240_1180480
*PAR0:	but now he actually will say he'll say all his colors and correctly identify things . 1181420_1187020
*PAR0:	but <he still> [/] he still likes yellow especially yellow cars . 1187020_1191300
*PAR0:	every time we see a yellow car he gets very excited green . 1191300_1200760
*PAR0:	I thought you might have said like green or blue because he's wearing that today . 1200760_1203620
*PAR0:	yeah . 1203620_1204360
*PAR0:	sometimes you know kids will be like I want to wear this . 1204360_1207960
*PAR0:	not showing that preference yet . 1207960_1209440
*PAR0:	yeah . 1209440_1209740
*PAR0:	well <if I> [/] if I pull two things out and I say do you want to wear this or this he'll usually point to one or pick up one and throw it away . 1209740_1217520
*PAR0:	and so I figure he wants the other one . 1217520_1219880
*PAR0:	but &-uh we didn't do that today . 1219880_1222460
*PAR0:	so . 1222460_1223800
*PAR0:	okay well I think that's all the questions I have unless you want to add something else about the session . 1223800_1230460
*PAR0:	you know I think &-uh I think it was good . 1230460_1235900
*PAR0:	he's it's he's very focused in here . 1235900_1239720
*PAR0:	he's not always this focused at home . 1239720_1242320
*PAR0:	let's kind of well it might be also his &-uh shyness . 1243360_1246720
*PAR0:	he's [/] he's going through little things . 1247680_1249920
*PAR0:	what [/] what . 1250000_1250400
*PAR0:	do you think that is what do you think this is . 1250400_1253200
*PAR0:	I don't know is a slice of cheese before I turn the camera . 1253400_1260980
*PAR0:	we are basically done . 1260980_1263040
*PAR0:	okay . 1263040_1263380
*PAR0:	I just want to put &-uh something because I didn't &-uh I started the camera late . 1263380_1266860
*PAR0:	so I'm just going to put today's date and that &-um the id number or in the camera . 1267460_1272800
*PAR0:	but we're done . 1273040_1273580

*PAR0:	you did . 1278380_1282420
*PAR0:	oh no I don't know that I should have mentioned this on the camera . 1282420_1291280
*PAR0:	I thought it was really interesting . 1291280_1292000
*PAR0:	at the beginning of it he kept on looking over at you like every time I'd ask him a question he'd look over at you all the time . 1292000_1298360
*PAR0:	be like . 1298360_1298640
*PAR0:	are they listening to me . 1298640_1300640
*PAR0:	I just felt just . 1300640_1301280
