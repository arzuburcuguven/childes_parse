*PAR0:	what toys do you have at home . 0_2480
*PAR0:	&-um books we have some of these . 2480_6680
*PAR0:	but that's sort of a book . 6680_8040
*PAR0:	the Turkish &-um we don't have any of this . 8040_10900
*PAR0:	you of food . 10900_12660
*PAR0:	no we don't . 12660_13820
*PAR0:	and we have soft toys and plenty of food . 13820_16380
*PAR0:	okay . 16380_17680
*PAR0:	but yeah the rest we don't have any of . 17680_20140
*PAR0:	so this is all . 21060_21600
*PAR0:	but we might get plastic food because she seems to like to chew on it . 21620_24920
*PAR0:	so what kind of foods does she know sort of like what does she see in you . 25140_32180
*PAR0:	&-um well obviously she's still eating some mushed food . 32560_36820
*PAR0:	&-um but she I mean she's she knows oatmeal and fruit . 37180_41820
*PAR0:	and she knows bananas . 41820_42920
*PAR0:	she likes to hold banana . 43500_44660
*PAR0:	and you know if she doesn't not a lot goes in you know em she [/] she likes her piece of cheese . 45160_51280
*PAR0:	she [/] she em holds a piece of mozzarella and shouts at it . 51400_56980
*PAR0:	yeah it's funny . 57360_58180
*PAR0:	it's only cheese . 58300_59140
*PAR0:	she only shouts at the cheese . 59200_61200
*PAR0:	she doesn't shout at anything else . 61200_62840
*PAR0:	but &-uh &-um apart from that you know we [/] we [/] we when I give her fruit I try . 62840_69360
*PAR0:	and I show try and show her the fruit as you know before . 69360_72300
*PAR0:	I prepare it as much as possible . 72300_73940
*PAR0:	but I don't know that she would really know what bananas . 73940_76900
*PAR0:	yes because she holds it . 76900_78840
*PAR0:	but the rest . 78840_80300
*PAR0:	I don't know she she'll know the difference . 80300_83240
*PAR0:	so which ones of these was she most interested in the well the plate to start . 83240_87520
*PAR0:	and then obviously the spoon we had the tantrum over the removal of the spoon . 87520_92580
*PAR0:	&-um and she well she had played with the toast for a little [/] little bit . 92580_98000
*PAR0:	and this but I . 98000_100440
*PAR0:	think she'd like these because they are like just the perfect sort of shape and size to hold in your fist . 100440_106240
*PAR0:	and you know but at [/] at the moment obviously everything's just going in the mouth because of the teething . 106240_112020
*PAR0:	so really even [/] even if I gave her this it would go in the mouth . 112020_115820
*PAR0:	so it's kind of irrelevant what she's playing with . 115820_119160
*PAR0:	sort of . 119160_120000
*PAR0:	&-uh how many teeth do you have . 120000_122720
*PAR0:	just the two bottom ones . 122780_124040
*PAR0:	so the top ones are probably coming in . 124060_126160
*PAR0:	yeah . 126240_126500
*PAR0:	you gotta get a lot more into it . 126500_128340
*PAR0:	yeah . 128340_128680
*PAR0:	imagine that's what the chewing is . 128680_131180
*PAR0:	so you showed her some of the animals . 131580_133180
*PAR0:	yes . 134540_134920
*PAR0:	are there any animals that she's seen before . 135500_138820
*PAR0:	oh the bee . 139220_139900
*PAR0:	we've done bee . 140100_140900
*PAR0:	and we do the buzz of the bee and [/] and the soft toys . 140900_146640
*PAR0:	no . 146640_146960
*PAR0:	and [/] and we've done sheep . 147260_148880
*PAR0:	and she's seen that we actually watched program Word World which is where that comes I believe . 149180_155600
*PAR0:	so &-um so she's sort of seen sheep and then lots of books sheep . 155600_161320
*PAR0:	and she's got like a little plastic sheep . 161320_163380
*PAR0:	so but the rest not really does it make it sound like she's no toys like . 163380_169780
*PAR0:	but she [/] she doesn't have a lot . 170180_171840
*PAR0:	I don't sort of believe in a lot of like you know formal toys . 171840_175980
*PAR0:	because at that age literally like a spoon is a toy you know so to go out and like spend like a lot of money on these baby toys . 175980_184640
*PAR0:	is a bit ridiculous . 184640_185780
*PAR0:	I think I story because she's so tired at bedtime but we do morning story up in the nursery . 185780_206880
*PAR0:	and quite we try to formulate I'm very into books . 206880_211020
*PAR0:	&-um and she's . 211020_212240
*PAR0:	got a whole library herself already because people know I'm into books . 212240_215560
*PAR0:	so they bought her lots . 215560_216580
*PAR0:	and we do [/] do like the storytime . 216580_219380
*PAR0:	and sometimes I do it sitting in a lap . 219380_221500
*PAR0:	but more often she'll be sitting beside me and sort of half [/] half interacting . 221500_226420
*PAR0:	then I'd and I do I'm reading Winnie The Pooh the [/] the [/] the old you know official Winnie The Pooh original email stories to her . 227700_236460
*PAR0:	she's not while she plays I sit and read like a chapter you know it's not reading a story to her . 237060_243320
*PAR0:	it's for my enjoyment as much as anything . 243480_245580
*PAR0:	&-um you know I [/] I read to her or [/] or at her . 246040_249520
*PAR0:	well it's true because she's just playing . 250420_253400
*PAR0:	I'm not formally sitting her down and reading to her . 253400_255600
*PAR0:	I'm reading it at her . 255600_256640
*PAR0:	so &-uh yeah [/] yeah we do we try and do lots of books . 256640_262620
*PAR0:	and we have we go to the library you know every three weeks . 262620_266080
*PAR0:	and we get s some board books you know with simple things . 266080_270420
*PAR0:	because again like the baby's books there's not a lot of point in going out and buying lots of baby's books because she's not going to use them you know once she learns to read . 270420_278380
*PAR0:	yeah . 278380_279120
*PAR0:	so the library's great for that . 279120_281360
*PAR0:	and [/] and we do a lot of &-uh music and singing . 281360_284980
*PAR0:	I didn't subject you to my singing . 284980_286900
*PAR0:	but you usually playtime does involve me bursting into song at whatever we're playing with . 286900_293560
*PAR0:	&-um but I was a bit shy myself like we would have done Old Mcdonald with that book for example you know . 293560_301700
*PAR0:	so spoon again spoon I know I [/] I don't know what [/] what that's it's a Di that's a different one . 301700_310260
*PAR0:	but it's the same shape . 310260_313100
*PAR0:	so she [/] she knows how to use those like when she eats she [/] she no she [/] she [/] she doesn't know how to scoop out gold . 313460_320460
*PAR0:	I mean she's only eight months old . 320580_321880
*PAR0:	&-um but certainly when he if he gave her the spoon with a tiny bit on it you [/] you know it goes in her mouth . 322260_327780
*PAR0:	you know wouldn't trust her with a bowl yet . 327780_330000
*PAR0:	she might want to bust it out of the floor . 330800_333440
*PAR0:	huh . 333440_333680
*PAR0:	she [/] she knows . 333720_334560
*PAR0:	yeah she [/] she can tell what the spoon is because certainly there's one going into her mouth three times a day . 334760_339820
*PAR0:	oh something cracked . 339980_343260
*PAR0:	there . 343260_343560
*PAR0:	does she &-uh have any dolls or anything like that . 344160_347040
*PAR0:	she doesn't we don't have dolls . 347040_349280
*PAR0:	we have some soft toys but we don't have any baby dolls again . 349280_353120
*PAR0:	she's just a bit too young to really know the difference between like that and that . 353120_359640
*PAR0:	you know she's not going to start babying the doll yet . 359640_362820
*PAR0:	she will eventually get one because I know from my childhood I love my dolls . 362820_366240
*PAR0:	so . 366340_366620
*PAR0:	well I'm sure for probably her first birthday or something . 366620_369700
*PAR0:	she'll get some is there anything you thought she would be interested in . 369700_375300
*PAR0:	that . 375300_375440
*PAR0:	she wasn't em I thought she'd be more interested in the soft toys . 375440_382280
*PAR0:	but perhaps because's got soft toys . 382360_384200
*PAR0:	this was more of a novelty to her because she doesn't have little plastic things like that . 384200_388880
*PAR0:	so &-um you know she she's got soft toys . 388880_392160
*PAR0:	she's used to them . 392160_392820
*PAR0:	she's got them in her crib . 392820_393860
*PAR0:	you know it's like . 393860_394540
*PAR0:	oh I've done that . 394540_395560
*PAR0:	so yeah that was just me . 395560_399140
*PAR0:	and I was surprised . 399500_401560
*PAR0:	the book the books usually . 401560_402900
*PAR0:	go she picks up . 402900_403960
*PAR0:	and she starts chewing on them . 403960_405300
*PAR0:	anyway we have one with us just for chewing purposes . 405300_408200
*PAR0:	almost . 408200_408600
*PAR0:	&-um I thought she might have picked it up more . 408600_411560
*PAR0:	but the spoon seems to have won out . 411560_415040
*PAR0:	yeah . 415620_415920
*PAR0:	you look like you're ready to be done . 415920_418380
*PAR0:	are you ready to be d done . 419040_420440
*PAR0:	I just got a little spoon all right . 420440_424960
*PAR0:	she's got a couple of spoons in her lunch bag . 424960_427320
*PAR0:	so I reckon . 427320_428260
