@Comment:	Time is 16:09
@Comment:	MOT mostly watches Chi play and offers suggestions occasionally. Other than a brief discussion of what objects do or do not stick , there is no science talk. Chi quickly becomes bored with activity and announces that she is done several times during the activity. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
*INV:	www .
