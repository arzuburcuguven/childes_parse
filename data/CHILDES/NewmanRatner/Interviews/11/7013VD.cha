*PAR0:	yeah sure . 0_2540
*PAR0:	okay . 2540_8420
*PAR0:	&-um well once again Victor has kind of established some real world connections with the plates and the spoons . 8420_18020
*PAR0:	and I I've seen a definite difference in between his understanding of that food goes in the plates even in the last two weeks . 18020_28220
*PAR0:	&-um he's definitely drawn some greater conclusions that like we put the food on the plate and then trying to feed himself or the baby . 28220_38460
*PAR0:	and it was really interesting because the la I didn't I'd never seen him play around a doll before . 38460_44160
*PAR0:	and I went to his daycare . 44160_46120
*PAR0:	he was feeding the baby doll the last time with the bottle and the sippy cup . 46120_49700
*PAR0:	and I went to his daycare . 49700_50860
*PAR0:	and I was like . 50860_51300
*PAR0:	do you have any dolls that because I'd never seen Victor nope [/] nope [/] nope [/] nope [/] nope . 51300_56500
*PAR0:	no . 56500_58680
*PAR0:	I'd never seen him playing with a baby doll . 58680_66300
*PAR0:	and I thought it was so cute . 66300_67920
*PAR0:	and his &-um his daycare provider said . 67920_71040
*PAR0:	yeah there's a little girl who's two that has a doll there . 71040_74220
*PAR0:	and they feed the baby doll . 74220_76940
*PAR0:	so I thought that was really sweet . 76940_78960
*PAR0:	and the fact that he was doing it here showed how he was drawing that kind of connection . 78960_84200
*PAR0:	I think . 84200_85500
*PAR0:	so &-um that was neat . 85500_87700
*PAR0:	he once again was very interested in the spoons . 87700_90560
*PAR0:	but this time unlike last time he was really interested in mimicking the action of taking food from the plate and the bowls and feeding both himself and the baby . 90560_103600
*PAR0:	he was like . 103600_105080
*PAR0:	so that was neat . 105080_106720
*PAR0:	and I think that the nubbly textured rubbery playthings were kind of soothing on his mouth because he's teething again . 106720_115300
*PAR0:	so he liked to gnaw on them a bit . 115300_119660
*PAR0:	did were any of those &-uh rubbery items you think familiar to . 120720_124600
*PAR0:	him either the names or the look the &-um the peas . 124600_129280
*PAR0:	he hasn't had pasta yet . 129380_131620
*PAR0:	that's a little bit advanced for him . 131960_133660
*PAR0:	still . 133660_134060
*PAR0:	&-um he's never had . 134780_137020
*PAR0:	oh thanks . 137020_137580
*PAR0:	he's never had pizza before . 137580_141400
*PAR0:	but he has had little cookies . 141400_147060
*PAR0:	he has treats that look similar to this like little cookies and crackers and things that he feeds himself that are a bit smaller but the same type of principle and the shoes and the socks . 147060_159600
*PAR0:	he definitely picked that up for the items of clothing for the baby doll and &-um the spoons definitely and the little plates too . 159600_169340
*PAR0:	so for most of the food items I think it might be familiar to him from coming here but not necessarily from food that he's eaten maybe more like what he's seen my husband . 169340_179840
*PAR0:	and I eat . 179840_181740
*PAR0:	and we have a few of these books at home . 181740_186940
*PAR0:	so that was interesting . 186940_188260
*PAR0:	but as soon as he sees a book he like starts rifling through it . 188260_191920
*PAR0:	he's out there baby to the baby . 191920_194900
*PAR0:	yeah he's learned &-uh oh &-uh oh nope we don't play with cameras . 196040_203220
*PAR0:	we don't play with cameras . 204240_205880
*PAR0:	he was very interested in this clock too . 206440_213340
*PAR0:	is he &-um do you think he's understanding when you direct when you try to direct the play . 213340_219480
*PAR0:	&-uh I think so . 219480_220480
*PAR0:	yes for the &-um for the most part sometimes [/] sometimes I'll ask him questions like where's the spoon . 220480_229440
*PAR0:	and he'll pick it up and give it to me . 229440_231460
*PAR0:	okay . 231920_231980
*PAR0:	&-um or I'll <when I> [/] when I asked him where the baby's shoe was . 232360_236880
*PAR0:	he picked it up . 236880_238080
*PAR0:	and he tried to put it on you know like not actual put it on the baby but . 238080_241700
*PAR0:	he motioned towards the baby doll's foot . 241700_243700
*PAR0:	&-um sometimes he has a mind of his own too . 244780_248180
*PAR0:	like when he crawled over there . 249080_250580
*PAR0:	and I told him to come back to me . 250580_252080
*PAR0:	and he didn't immediately because he was more interested in what was over there than coming back . 252080_256280
*PAR0:	but then he did sometimes you just have to capture their &-um attention . 256280_261960
*PAR0:	right . 262400_262860
*PAR0:	does he &-um does he follow like &-uh if you were to say like come over here or if you wanted him to look at something that you're looking at . 263240_271940
*PAR0:	is he following those types of things . 272440_274400
*PAR0:	yes . 274400_274680
*PAR0:	&-um what kind what works for him . 275220_277200
*PAR0:	what does he like know how does he know to &-um a lot of times I'll say . 277280_283660
*PAR0:	Victor come here come to mommy . 284880_286600
*PAR0:	and then he'll come over to me Victor [/] Victor come to mommy . 286800_292140
*PAR0:	come to mommy . 292140_293040
*PAR0:	and sometimes it's like gestures . 293040_294620
*PAR0:	and sometimes it's the words . 294620_296220
*PAR0:	but a lot of times he'll come over to my general direction . 296220_299120
*PAR0:	and then I'll put it in front of him . 299120_301220
*PAR0:	and like we'll play games like I'll hide objects and see if he can find them . 301220_305960
*PAR0:	a lot of times . 305960_306460
*PAR0:	he's really good at finding things that he's really interested in . 306460_309400
*PAR0:	like tv remote control . 309400_312160
*PAR0:	nope and shiny things with lights . 312160_314980
*PAR0:	shiny things with lights . 314980_318800
*PAR0:	do you see the spirits . 318800_323160
*PAR0:	did you find yourself doing anything different . 323160_327500
*PAR0:	I wasn't around for the other play sessions but like building sandwiches or making use of like bringing the toys together . 327500_333740
*PAR0:	closer . 333740_334600
*PAR0:	I did that a little bit more this time to try to draw more real world &-um conclusions like building the sandwiches rather than just having separate pieces . 334600_343000
*PAR0:	although he's . 343000_344180
*PAR0:	still little to see sandwiches . 344180_346960
*PAR0:	I really understand what that is . 346960_349400
*PAR0:	perhaps . 349400_349880
*PAR0:	&-um but it's good to introduce children to new things like that . 349880_355900
*PAR0:	so yay Cookie Victor likes cookies . 355900_362180
*PAR0:	how about the animal pile . 362180_363680
*PAR0:	did you play with any of the stuffed animals today . 363680_365660
*PAR0:	not really I tried to play with the puppet here . 365660_369700
*PAR0:	and he just like wasn't very interested . 369700_372700
*PAR0:	he was more interested today in playing with like the texturized rubberized things . 372700_378040
*PAR0:	he's been really interested in this . 378040_379840
*PAR0:	the past few visits . 379840_381580
*PAR0:	he knows just what he wants . 402220_405600
*PAR0:	and a lot of times if he's really concentrating it's difficult to get his attention . 405600_413080
*PAR0:	if he already has his mindset on doing something like going for the camera . 413080_420640
*PAR0:	Victor no [/] no . 420640_424820
*PAR0:	is he walking &-um almost not quite he can pull himself up . 424820_435420
*PAR0:	and he's cruising quite a bit . 435420_436960
*PAR0:	and he'll actually move . 436960_439220
*PAR0:	he has an Exer saucer . 439220_441560
*PAR0:	it's like this big activity station that he actually likes to push all the way across the room all the time . 441560_447240
*PAR0:	like he just pushes the whole thing . 447240_449580
*PAR0:	can't remember what he's doing right now . 449800_450960
*PAR0:	exactly what are you up to . 451080_454340
*PAR0:	you see the stickers pretty colors are you going through colors [/] colors . 454400_461640
*PAR0:	yeah . 461640_461940
*PAR0:	we do kind of work with them quite a bit . 461940_465160
*PAR0:	&-um it's more like introduction phase . 465160_469600
*PAR0:	I'm not sure that he totally understands what's Red but we do work with them . 469600_473040
*PAR0:	quite [/] quite a bit . 473040_475600
*PAR0:	what do you think Victor are you . 475600_478440
*PAR0:	alright . 478440_483540
*PAR0:	&-uh do you think there are any new words that &-uh may have been introduced into today . 483540_489160
*PAR0:	just had the opportunity to be introduced . 489160_491400
*PAR0:	maybe pizza . 491400_492780
*PAR0:	I m we might have I might have taught him that the last time . 492780_496180
*PAR0:	but it may have been more familiar . 496180_497500
*PAR0:	spaghetti . 497500_498080
*PAR0:	I don't know if I actually said this is spaghetti . 498080_500340
*PAR0:	&-um the last time ice cream cone I taught him before kangaroo . 500340_507480
*PAR0:	I mentioned this is a kangaroo . 507480_509520
*PAR0:	and I was trying to teach him like this is the mommy . 509520_511800
*PAR0:	and this is the baby . 511800_512860
*PAR0:	and correlating that like this is Victor this is mama . 512860_517260
*PAR0:	but he wasn't really that interested . 517260_521440
*PAR0:	he wasn't that interested . 521440_524580
*PAR0:	is there anything else . 524580_526460
*PAR0:	&-um that you could pinpoint that was different from his last time or even his first time I would say that the biggest difference that I noticed was the connections that he was drawing to the actual picture . 526460_541440
*PAR0:	I think that was the biggest difference . 541440_555320
*PAR0:	I could definitely see that he was responding to real world connections &-um more quickly and more easily . 555320_566940
*PAR0:	did he think throughout . 566940_573080
*PAR0:	yeah he was really interested in the food the last time . 573080_577540
*PAR0:	he liked these peas the last time more . 577540_579860
*PAR0:	but &-um and he liked the pizza a lot . 579860_583320
*PAR0:	but he was more interested in like actually putting the food items like the cookie and the pizza in his mouth this time even more so than he had been before . 583320_593460
*PAR0:	and it could be because he's teething . 593460_594920
*PAR0:	but it also might be that he's drawing that connection . 594920_597500
*PAR0:	he also pretty s quite early on in the session started playing with a baby doll . 597680_604120
*PAR0:	which he had been doing before . 604120_606180
*PAR0:	but &-um it was really quick . 606440_608540
*PAR0:	and I think he s he immediately recognized the doll . 608680_611660
*PAR0:	hey [/] hey Sweetie he's getting really fast . 611660_618100
*PAR0:	come it was almost till the end of the session the last time when he saw the doll and started feeding it . 618100_653720
*PAR0:	but this time it was like almost immediate that he saw the doll and saw the bottle . 653720_658420
*PAR0:	and then saw the sippy cup and kept feeding it . 658420_661240
*PAR0:	sorry . 661720_663280
*PAR0:	he feeding the baby doll . 663740_665340
*PAR0:	so &-um so I [/] I noticed that . 665720_669980
*PAR0:	and I think we would like to recognize them really quickly . 669980_673580
*PAR0:	and he's always really interested in the spoons which is he likes to play with spoons a lot at home . 673580_679460
*PAR0:	but he [/] he eats primarily with like spoons but it's not his bottle . 679460_684600
*PAR0:	so we feed him . 684600_687700
*PAR0:	he's still [/] still in &-um baby food . 687700_692340
*PAR0:	you know you want to push that . 692340_695440
*PAR0:	but he's so funny . 695440_696540
*PAR0:	now he really wants to like push it across the room . 696540_700780
*PAR0:	what are you up to . 702760_705180
*PAR0:	yep . 706100_707240
*PAR0:	he's just about to start walking independently . 707260_710900
*PAR0:	well I think that's all the questions I have for today . 710900_714960
*PAR0:	okay . 714960_716060
*PAR0:	&-um as far as the longitudinal study is concerned we are &-um essentially done except for the last section . 716060_725260
*PAR0:	right . 725260_725900
*PAR0:	and that's when he's two years . 726080_728100
