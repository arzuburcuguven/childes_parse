*PAR0:	at daycare &-um and I've heard he plays on occasion with that baby [/] baby doll . 111260_116180
*PAR0:	and he loves books . 116180_117260
*PAR0:	I think I was interested in the books last time . 117520_121640
*PAR0:	and I showed him because that's an easy way for me to play with him . 121640_125960
*PAR0:	I know exactly what I'm supposed to do . 126040_127280
*PAR0:	but &-um today he didn't or yeah right here he didn't seem so interested in the books . 127560_131980
*PAR0:	and then how about the stuffed animals last time . 132840_134960
*PAR0:	and this time &-um last time he did have some interest in the stuffed animals not as much as the peas . 134960_142420
*PAR0:	&-uh but I remember he liked the bee . 142420_144620
*PAR0:	&-um and this time he wasn't really so into them . 145480_148100
*PAR0:	&-um and he doesn't really play with them at home a little bit . 148260_154480
*PAR0:	so he has some stuffed animals at home . 155460_157180
*PAR0:	yes we don't they're not as accessible as the plastic toys I guess or wood . 157480_165740
*PAR0:	mm . 166780_167020
*PAR0:	hm . 167020_167160
*PAR0:	so he does have plastic toys . 167280_170080
*PAR0:	does he have &-uh dishes or food things like we have here . 170180_173960
*PAR0:	no he doesn't actually I [/] I would have thought . 174100_177000
*PAR0:	oh too young for yeah play or pretend but we'll see getting up there . 177000_181060
*PAR0:	yeah exactly . 181880_182740
*PAR0:	yeah . 182940_183180
*PAR0:	&-um okay let's see . 184000_187120
*PAR0:	so do you think there's any particular kind of toy that's good for his personality in particular . 188000_199140
*PAR0:	&-um personality . 199140_202560
*PAR0:	yeah . 202560_202920
*PAR0:	just sort of like his activity levels and his &-uh at [/] at home he loves books . 202920_211200
*PAR0:	and he loves to read them himself or he'll hand them to you to read . 211420_214340
*PAR0:	so that kind of independent and sharing is what I think of . 214340_218760
*PAR0:	so like when he had the two ice . 218760_220420
*PAR0:	cream cones that was independent . 220420_222140
*PAR0:	but then he gave me one . 222140_223040
*PAR0:	so it was like sharing so something like that where he can &-uh can share or [/] or not I guess that's what I would think of . 223040_232180
*PAR0:	we have some big blocks at home . 232180_236040
*PAR0:	maybe little blocks . 236040_236980
*PAR0:	we have some things . 236980_237660
*PAR0:	he can containers . 237660_239160
*PAR0:	he puts stuff into or takes out of you like that . 239160_242460
*PAR0:	huh . 242460_243120
*PAR0:	you sure do you're starting to like things with wheels . 243120_246720
*PAR0:	I'll get you a little I'll wipe your face off . 246720_251380
*PAR0:	you poor guy gotcha [/] gotcha [/] gotcha . 251380_257540
*PAR0:	so you were saying there are some things you have at home that he really likes that we don't have right here like the big blocks right . 258520_263860
*PAR0:	and he even tell yeah or &-uh the batteries and the buttons where you press it . 263960_271040
*PAR0:	and it sings a song . 271040_271800
*PAR0:	he's getting to that . 271980_272640
*PAR0:	so how about balls . 274800_276860
*PAR0:	does he [/] he has a few balls but they're okay . 276860_280140
*PAR0:	they &-uh they like have bells on them or fun things . 280720_286140
*PAR0:	&-um so they're not just balls . 286720_287980
*PAR0:	but he he's done a few just balls . 288140_289760
*PAR0:	and he can do some give and take and &-uh little baby throws I guess . 289820_297080
*PAR0:	so not consistently that's okay . 297800_301480
*PAR0:	sure that's very interesting . 302100_304180
*PAR0:	well he may &-um show something different . 304500_308560
*PAR0:	the next time you're here . 308560_309440
*PAR0:	oh for sure . 309480_310160
*PAR0:	and when is the next time . 310280_311340
*PAR0:	so the next time is going to be &-um awhile right . 311440_315120
