@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	now [!] this next part is kind of fun .
@Comment:	Time is 14:18. Videotape does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audiotape
@Comment:	The interaction between Mot and Chi was good in this activity. They both cooperated in working with the magnets , usually piling up the magnets into towers together. Chi usually directed the activities , at one point explaining a game which they played called <stack (th)em>. In this game , they built up a tower of magnets and then the player used the yellow wand to remove the magnets from the tower one by one. There was not much science talk at all. Several times they discussed a little if a particular magnet attracted or repelled other magnets. EXP took a semi-active role in this activity , frequently commenting on the play and encouraging Chi.
*INV:	(be)cause we get to bring out things that <you haven't> [//] you may not remember but we brought you a while back .
*INV:	www .
*CHI:	www .
%com:	EXP and Chi briefly discuss books that Chi still has from previous home visits , and books and the blue backpack he wasn't allowed to keep
*INV:	so in any event these are things +//.
@Comment:	Time is 14:58
*INV:	that are falling all over the place .
*INV:	++ that we brought you guys to play with when you were five .

%act:	holds the purple star over the pile of magnets
*MOT:	you mean you put them [= magnets in the pile] all on top of each_other ?
*CHI:	hm: ?
*CHI:	no you try to take them [= magnets in the pile] off without making the &~s tower fall .
*CHI:	let's try that .

*MOT:	oh .
%sit:	MOT and Chi start building up a tower again
*CHI:	oh &=laughs .
*CHI:	ah ah +...
%int:	high pitched
*MOT:	let's see .
*MOT:	watch .
%act:	puts some nuts on the painted side of the purple star (one side of the star is painted purple and the other is unpainted , leaving the metal exposed)
*MOT:	when you put some of them [= nuts] on it makes it [= purple star] +//.
*MOT:	oh no I guess it's [= purple star] not doing it .
%sit:	the nuts don't stick to the painted side of the purple star
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	that's why you can't put them [= magnets] on with that [= purple star] .
*CHI:	and when you .
*CHI:	I +/.
*MOT:	the power is going out_of it [= purple star] .
*CHI:	I [//] okay who's going first ?

*MOT:	yeah .
*CHI:	xxx [=! strange sound] !
%int:	high pitched
*CHI:	ah !
*CHI:	get on here .
%sit:	puts a silver man on the red ball
*CHI:	ah !
%int:	high pitched
*CHI:	<do you> [//] now can you remember this [= magnets activity] Mom ?
*MOT:	no .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	<I don't> [=! laughing] remember this [= activity] .
*CHI:	look_it .
%sit:	Chi put the red ball on top of a tower of nuts , and then put another magnet on the ball , which ended up swinging from the ball
*MOT:	uhhuh .
*CHI:	www &=noises .
*CHI:	who's going first ?
*CHI:	+^ you or me Mom ?
*MOT:	whaddya [: what do you] mean ?
*MOT:	oh you go ahead .
*MOT:	+^ I don't know what you're talking about so .
*CHI:	we're playing a game .
*CHI:	I'll teach you .
*CHI:	I will teach you .
*CHI:	(..) whoa .
*CHI:	watch .
*CHI:	+^ it [= paper clip] goes flying .
%sit:	refers to a paper clip which he put on one magnet and then fell onto the base because the base magnet attracted it
*MOT:	mhm .
*CHI:	ah !
*CHI:	okay I'll stack (th)em [= magnets] .
*CHI:	okay we'll play the game stack (th)em .
%act:	starts to pull everything off the base magnet
*CHI:	who's going first ?
*MOT:	you'll hafta (be)cause I don't know what you're talking about .
*CHI:	stack (th)em .
*CHI:	+^ now it's [/] it's your idea .
*MOT:	okay .
*MOT:	stack just the guys [= silver men] .
*CHI:	no .
*CHI:	I meant with this [= yellow wand] .
*CHI:	who goes first ?
*MOT:	whaddya [: what do you] mean ?
*CHI:	go [>] .
*MOT:	oh [<] you go first .
*CHI:	take (.) a guy [= silver man] .
%sit:	Chi puts the yellow wand over a silver man which sticks to the wand , and then holds the wand over the base magnet , probably expecting the silver man to fall onto the base
*MOT:	oh he's [= silver man] not gonna <go on> [=! laughing] there [= base] without you .
*MOT:	whoa .
*CHI:	grab [?] him [= silver man] Mom .
%int:	laughing
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	it's [= base] repeling against him [= silver man] .
*MOT:	&-uh xxx .
*INV:	&=laughs [>] .
*CHI:	&=laughs [<] .
*CHI:	okay get up there .
%act:	Chi is able to make a silver man stand up on the base using the wand
*CHI:	okay .
*MOT:	oh .
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	whatever way it [= washers] hits it [= washers] stays that way .
%sit:	Chi pulls some washers that had stuck to the wand off the wand and drops them onto the base magnet
*MOT:	I thought you weren't sposta use your hands ?
*CHI:	I willn't .
*CHI:	you can just move them [= magnets] on the thing [= yellow wand] .
*MOT:	oh I see .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	just on this thing [= yellow wand] you see ?
*MOT:	rules change as <you get> [//] it gets more difficult right ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*CHI:	watch .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	touches the yellow wand to the base , probably in order to make the washer and silver man on the yellow wand stick to the base , but instead the base stuck to the wand and was lifted up a little
*MOT:	see ?
*CHI:	okay .
*CHI:	you stack everything up and I'll show you what I mean .
*MOT:	stack it [= magnets] up on here [= base magnet] ?
*CHI:	yup .
*MOT:	okay &=yawns .
*CHI:	everything not just the guys [= silver men] .
*CHI:	+^ just everything .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	stacks five silver men on top of each other
*CHI:	nineteen ninety four Olympic games .
*MOT:	mhm .
*CHI:	everything .
*CHI:	+^ stack everything .
*CHI:	+^ now try to take them [= silver men] down without knocking <them down> [//] (.) <the stack> [//] the tower down .
%sit:	MOT loops washers around the men's arms
*CHI:	what are they [= silver men] holding the Olympic circles or something ?
*INV:	yeah [>] .
*MOT:	&=laughs [<] .
*CHI:	oh say +...
%int:	sings
*MOT:	hm: .
*CHI:	<that's [= nut] gonna> [//] <I might> [//] I think that [= nut] might knock it [= tower of silver men] even down .
%sit:	MOT tries to decide where on the tower to put a heavy nut , eventually putting it right on the base magnet
*MOT:	I know .
*MOT:	whoops .
%sit:	the tower falls down
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	oh well .
*CHI:	let's see which one's [= yellow wand and base] more stronger .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	holds the yellow wand above a silver man standing on the base magnet and then touches the wand to the man; the man stays on the base , and when Chi repeats this process , the man sticks to the wand
*CHI:	okay I'll help you stack (th)em [= magnets] up .
*CHI:	first goes +//.
%sit:	Chi pulls all the magnets off the base and Mot puts a silver stick on its end on the base
*CHI:	yeah .
*CHI:	that [//] is there another one [= silver stick] ?
*MOT:	yup right next_to me .
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	this [= second silver stick] goes here and this [= first silver stick] goes here .
%act:	puts a second silver stick on its end next to Mot's stick
*CHI:	and we gotta try to balance the ball .
%act:	puts a red ball on top of one silver stick
*CHI:	oh .
*INV:	hm: .
*CHI:	xxx the ball balance (.) ball xxx .
%act:	tries to get the red and yellow balls to stay on top of the sticks , but they both fall
*CHI:	xxx get (th)em [= silver sticks] close to it [= referent unclear] .
*MOT:	(.) hm: like this .
%act:	puts two washers on their edges on the base next to each other
*CHI:	balance the ball .
%act:	balances the red ball on the ends of the two silver sticks
*CHI:	then you try to put (th)em [= magnets] in a stack .
%sit:	MOT and Chi start stacking silver men and some other small magnets on top of each other
*CHI:	a tower mom .
*CHI:	London .
*CHI:	<this &-um> [//] the [//] this [/] this ball [= yellow ball] is a magnet .
*MOT:	mhm .
*CHI:	oh I know .
*CHI:	I'll get it .
%act:	starts clearing off the base magnet
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	watch this .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	puts a silver man on the base and a silver stick lengthwise on top of him
*CHI:	y(ou) know like he's going towards the thing [= referent unclear] .
*CHI:	and he hasta hold it [= silver stick] .
*CHI:	all the guys [= silver men] on this [= silver stick] .
%sit:	Chi and then Mot stack silver men on the silver stick and then on each other
*MOT:	think [?] it [= silver stick] the surface ?
*CHI:	yeah and if they [= silver men] fall off they're dead .
*CHI:	yeah yeah yeah yeah .
%int:	whispered
*CHI:	how did you know ?
*MOT:	hm: .
*MOT:	I know everything .
*CHI:	(.) is there any other guys [= silver men] ?
*MOT:	hm: nope .
*CHI:	okay wait .
*CHI:	okay .
*CHI:	he [= silver man] holds an Olympic .
%sit:	<$=4> Chi and Mot loop washers around the arms of the silver men
*MOT:	hm: ?
*MOT:	hm: .
*CHI:	hm: .
*INV:	oh !
%sit:	the tower of men fell down
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*INV:	oh now it's [= tower of magnets] +...
*CHI:	get [/] get everything off here (be)cause when I go to grab it [= referent unclear] I know it's [= tower] gonna fall down .
*CHI:	I got an even better idea .
*CHI:	like he's [= silver man] a real guy and it's [= silver stick] probably going to break his [//] every bone in his body .
%act:	puts a silver stick on its end on the base and then puts a silver man flat on the end of the stick; then clears away everything else from the base magnet
*MOT:	you can put him [= silver man] on top .
%sit:	Chi puts another silver man on top of the first silver man
*CHI:	and this [= another silver stick] xxx .
*MOT:	huh ?
*INV:	yeah it's like the circus .
*CHI:	I'm gonna make my own circus .
*CHI:	+^ watch .
%act:	puts a silver man flat on the end of a silver stick again
*CHI:	www [=! sound effects] .
*CHI:	this xxx with me .
*CHI:	if this [= configuration of silver men and sticks] could happen in real life this would be the most amazing thing in the whole (.) world .
%sit:	keeps stacking silver men and sticks
*MOT:	oh time for bed .
*CHI:	ah .
%sit:	the tower of men fell
*CHI:	just stack (th)em [= magnets] in a tower and then we'll .
*MOT:	okay .
*MOT:	no .
*CHI:	just don't make the people [= silver men] on top of the people .
*CHI:	<three people> [>] .
*MOT:	<you have> [<] the right idea Chi .
*MOT:	see what you do .
*CHI:	you hafta make <everything in one> [>] tower .
*MOT:	<you go like this> [<] .
%sit:	Chi and Mot start stacking silver men and sticks again
*MOT:	then put one of these [= silver stick] .
*MOT:	whoops .
*MOT:	can't get it [= silver stick] off there [= base] .
*CHI:	(.) that [>] .
*MOT:	<you [= silver man] can> [<] balance on it [= silver stick] .
*CHI:	no you [= silver man] can go upside down .
*MOT:	okay you [= silver man] can go upside down .
*CHI:	(be)cause the head will be holding him [= silver man] up .
*MOT:	where's the other one [= silver man] ?
*MOT:	no more guys [= silver men] ?
*CHI:	<xxx stack> [>] .
*MOT:	<where's the other little xxx [= silver stick]> [<] ?
*MOT:	there [>] it [= silver stick] is .
*CHI:	what [<] ?
*CHI:	oh .
*MOT:	let's see .
*MOT:	if we can get this one [= silver man] off .
*CHI:	<wrong way> [/] wrong way .
*CHI:	&-uh .
*CHI:	oh !
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	and then ?
*MOT:	the ball in the middle ?
*MOT:	where that [= referent unclear] goes ?
*CHI:	oh know what I was wondering what could happen ?
*CHI:	the ball would just <float in the air> [>] ?
*MOT:	<whoops it's [= red ball]> [<] not going to go on there .
%int:	laughing
%sit:	tries to put the red ball on the side of a silver stick in the middle of the configuration , but it falls off immediately
*CHI:	if the ball would just froat [//] float in the air like droo@c .
*INV:	oh yeah .
*INV:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	they [= balls] really are floating .
%sit:	Chi let go of the yellow and red balls on the table and they were drawn towards the base magnet
*INV:	I think they [= balls] like the xxx .
*CHI:	okay .
*CHI:	what am I trying to do here ?
*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	<Mom I can't> [=! laughing] .
*CHI:	&=laughs .

*INV:	well that was pretty cool Chi .
*CHI:	now the hard part .
%act:	picks up the yellow wand
*INV:	uhoh .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	starts to pick off pieces from the tower one at a time using the yellow wand
*MOT:	(.) oh !
