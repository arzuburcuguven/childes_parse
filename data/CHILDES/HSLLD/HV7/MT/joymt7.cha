*CHI:	do we needta put sauce on here Mom ?
@Comment:	MOT , Chi , SIS , and Mot's boyfriend participate in an 12 minute long MT in which they discuss getting a puppy to keep their current dog company. I think Sis made the ravioli that's served for dinner. The boyfriend asks Chi about her math project (A+plus).
