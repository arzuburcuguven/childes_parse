*PAR0:	and it was interesting . 292620_293120
*PAR0:	she was calling a girl and a boy . 293120_294220
*PAR0:	<she said> [/] she said . 294280_295040
*PAR0:	it's a boy . 295040_295400
*PAR0:	and she said . 295440_295640
*PAR0:	no it's a girl . 295640_296220

*PAR0:	can I have some photo of us please . 328060_330100
*PAR0:	he [/] he [/] he [/] he [/] he &-um and are there any other things that she usually plays with at home that aren't that we don't have here or a snow . 330580_340140
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh well she [/] she loves blocks . 340140_343140
*PAR0:	&-um is she ready to go to school . 343720_346440
*PAR0:	I'm trying to think what else we have . 346440_347380
*PAR0:	we have a huge box of &-um like dress up clothes . 347440_349980
*PAR0:	I mean it's just it's they're not really dress up clothes . 350200_351760
*PAR0:	but it's just all the stuff that we have like kind of lying around like an old cell phone that she can use and more re more stuff real life stuff . 351780_357960
*PAR0:	she plays with at you know like it's . 358120_360320

*PAR0:	we also have a whole set of dishes that she really likes . 365020_367740
*PAR0:	&-um and I'm surprised . 367960_369200
*PAR0:	she initially kind of saw the animals and got kind of interested I think because of the boxes . 369200_372680
*PAR0:	but then when she saw the babies she like ditched the animals . 372820_375600
*PAR0:	so that was kind of interesting . 375820_376600
*PAR0:	we have a lot of . 376660_377280
*PAR0:	oops . 377280_378040
*PAR0:	sorry . 378040_378300
*PAR0:	we have a huge bag full of animal or box full of animals like that . 378520_381840
*PAR0:	yeah . 381840_382020
*PAR0:	so she probably recognized a lot of those . 382200_384100
*PAR0:	but <did she> [/] did she pick any of them up . 384100_386220
*PAR0:	she picked up the tree I think because we don't have one of these . 386220_388160
*PAR0:	and she was kind of fascinated I think initially . 388160_389620
*PAR0:	but then it was all over . 389620_391460
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah . 391460_396260
*PAR0:	&-um to there <that's a> [/] that's a baby's hat . 396260_400140
*PAR0:	huh baby . 400140_401920

*PAR0:	mhm . 403800_404380
*PAR0:	right now . 404380_406480
*PAR0:	this is baby's . 406480_407300
*PAR0:	she's all dressed up . 407300_408240
*PAR0:	yeah . 408240_408960
*PAR0:	I'm trying to think <what other> [/] what other . 408960_410560
*PAR0:	oh we have trains that she loves trucks balls . 410560_414200
*PAR0:	we have a huge basket of balls that she loves &-um a lot of stuffed animals . 414200_418800
*PAR0:	so those are the kinds of things we have at home . 418800_420780
*PAR0:	okay . 421080_421240
*PAR0:	I just have own baby . 421240_423140
*PAR0:	but she also just got a baby <for her> [/] for her birthday . 423140_426520
*PAR0:	mm . 426520_426540
*PAR0:	hmm . 426540_426780
*PAR0:	and she did she's not she's never had her own baby . 426780_429400
*PAR0:	oh she always shares she we have one that she shares with her brother &-uh one or two that she shares with her brother . 429400_433420
*PAR0:	so now it's kinda neat because she's really it's like her baby now . 433420_435920
*PAR0:	and she's really getting into dressing it . 435920_438080
*PAR0:	and [/] and it's got a little bottle that comes with it . 438080_440780
*PAR0:	so she's been feeding it . 440780_441740
*PAR0:	so <this is> [/] this is can this [/] this . 441740_450920
*PAR0:	yeah . 451320_451380
*PAR0:	&-um and did you notice anything else about her play today was it similar to what she's done in the past in other play sessions . 454520_460120
*PAR0:	yeah . 460120_460300
*PAR0:	oh in other play sessions I mean she's a lot more interactive now . 460300_463020
*PAR0:	right . 463020_463400
*PAR0:	&-um it's funny because both of the other times she went to the food . 463400_465860
*PAR0:	think she [/] she played with the food the most both times . 466560_468720
*PAR0:	but it's funny because she before she's kind of looked at the babies . 469040_472060
*PAR0:	but she hasn't really played with them that much . 472060_473900
*PAR0:	maybe just a little bit . 474300_475240
*PAR0:	but &-um but these babies have a lot more clothes and more going on . 475240_478280
*PAR0:	and this food's a . 478340_478980
*PAR0:	little bit more intricate than some of the other food she's seen . 478980_481040
*PAR0:	so and the stove is new . 481040_483020
*PAR0:	mhm . 483440_483680
*PAR0:	so yeah just more interaction . 483740_486080
*PAR0:	anything else . 486840_487960
*PAR0:	you notice that . 487960_488680
*PAR0:	I don't think that . 506980_507500
*PAR0:	she's I say that a lot . 507500_509740
*PAR0:	so I don't know why she said that picked it up . 509740_512160
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 512240_512680
*PAR0:	because you know usually the first thing I do when I get home is I cook dinner . 512680_515520
*PAR0:	so she's that was funny that she said that . 515760_517380
*PAR0:	&-uh it's funny because we don't actually give her very much mac and cheese . 517660_520800
*PAR0:	and so I was surprised to hear that . 520960_521920
*PAR0:	she said she pretty patient . 521920_548600
*PAR0:	I was &-uh she did fine . 548600_549960
*PAR0:	Nemo [/] Nemo yes . 549960_551500

*PAR0:	okay . 560980_561640
*PAR0:	we're done . 561640_562620
*PAR0:	so I still need to fill out that form too . 562620_565760
