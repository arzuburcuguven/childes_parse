@Comment:	There were two separate mealtimes recorded on this tape. During the first one , there was not much talking. This is a transcript of the second mealtime , in which there was a greater amount of talking. The television is on loudly in the background. Present at the mealtime are Chi , Chi's Brother , MOTher , and Mot's fiance. They discuss a few things , but mainly they discuss Chi's lunch situation that day. FIA only takes part in the beginning of the mealtime conversation , so that the lunch conversation involves only Chi , BRO , and Mot. All seemed very natural and comfortable with the tape recorder there.
