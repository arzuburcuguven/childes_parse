@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	12-DEC-1993
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	this last thing is kind of fun and if you don't mind we are going to video tape your hands &-um so we can watch what you are doing .
@Comment:	Time is 20:04
@Comment:	For the most part , Chi works independently with the magnets , and Mot joins in rarely. It seems like Chi has her own agenda and does not want Mot to help with the magnets , often undoing what Mot has done. While Mot does not join in the play very often , she does comment almost constantly on what Chi does. There is no science talk in this activity.
@Comment:	video does not start until later; until then transcript is solely from audio
