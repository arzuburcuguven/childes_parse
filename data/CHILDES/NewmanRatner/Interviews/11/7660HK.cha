*PAR0:	I'm going to ask you some questions now . 0_3320
*PAR0:	yeah . 3500_3800
*PAR0:	so what are you and your daughter's favourites of that the spoons as usual . 4060_9140
*PAR0:	I she al and the [/] the toy food . 9880_12940
*PAR0:	she always used to like that plastic food . 13040_15020
*PAR0:	I guess probably because we're doing it round about lunchtime she's hungry as well . 15280_20780
*PAR0:	but do you think she thinks that the food is enough part partially . 21020_27960
*PAR0:	yes . 27960_28440
*PAR0:	&-uh yeah when she first sees it she liked the dolly . 28760_32580
*PAR0:	she's never ever interacted with a dolly before . 32660_35520
*PAR0:	we don't have one in the house just because we don't no [/] no particular reason . 36020_39800
*PAR0:	and [/] and the times before she'd ignored the dolly . 40360_42840
*PAR0:	but now she actually looked at it you know as if it was something else . 42880_48840
*PAR0:	but normally playtime is more running around . 50920_53800
*PAR0:	she's [/] she's sat quite quietly there you know because she'd just started walking last few weeks . 54020_60240
*PAR0:	she usually was running around . 60520_61840
*PAR0:	yeah and everything running around . 62260_65640
*PAR0:	yeah again I don't soft toys doesn't seem to even get her attention . 66900_72900
*PAR0:	is [/] is that the same with &-uh &-um . 73140_75800
*PAR0:	yes . 75800_77120
*PAR0:	did you miss . 77120_77720
*PAR0:	yes . 77720_77880
*PAR0:	I [/] I don't think she was that bothered with soft toys . 77880_80560
*PAR0:	there's a couple that I showed her . 80680_82200
*PAR0:	and [/] and she's kind of interacted with when I showed her them you know and I literally made her play with them . 82760_89840
*PAR0:	&-um I'm not quite sure why she favored this hard plastic better to chew on . 90600_97080
*PAR0:	you know she always seems to favor this food . 97080_100540
*PAR0:	I keep saying I need to buy some fake foods for her hand for a while . 100540_128600
*PAR0:	and that's probably about the only food . 128600_132440
*PAR0:	that should really any significant time . 132440_135540
*PAR0:	it was mainly the spoons again . 135540_137780
*PAR0:	we're just starting to sort of let practice her with the spoons . 137780_140660
*PAR0:	so I guess it's so it's the association from home . 140940_144660
*PAR0:	so is she using the spoons on her own or . 144920_149200
*PAR0:	no we're feeding her . 149200_150900
*PAR0:	but we've just started letting her have a spoon . 150900_153040
*PAR0:	and you know to try and start encourage her to feed herself . 153040_157400
*PAR0:	mean it's very early yet . 157800_159060
*PAR0:	but just let her feed her like that . 159060_166040
*PAR0:	putting food on her feet . 166760_168140
*PAR0:	I'm not sure like just w want to touch the mouth a lot . 168360_185980
*PAR0:	&-um and her face I was surprised . 186640_189420
*PAR0:	I put out the dolly shoes on because lately she's been obsessed with people's shoes at home . 189420_195360
*PAR0:	&-um and I was more she was just putting her foot up because she's seen the shoes . 195360_200920
*PAR0:	I was more surprised . 201260_202480
*PAR0:	she didn't like take them off and try and put them on herself because that's what she wouldn't like normally do at home . 202480_207580
*PAR0:	and if we [/] we have shoes on and off and for lying [/] lying there everything sort of goes on her feet . 207840_216080
*PAR0:	&-um yeah I think she thought it was another person obviously . 217440_222360
*PAR0:	and she's like . 222680_223300
*PAR0:	why is this not playing with me . 223300_224620
*PAR0:	but &-um yeah she always plays very differently here . 225760_231500
*PAR0:	yeah very quietly just sits there . 231900_235120
*PAR0:	I can't explain why she's so different . 236300_237960
*PAR0:	yeah &-um you know it's probably because I'm sat right here as well because at home I sit but rather we encourage her to you know be concentrate more on her motor skills you know at this age . 238380_253700
*PAR0:	and she picked up language obviously . 254280_256700
*PAR0:	we speak to her quite a bit . 256700_258020
*PAR0:	and we're trying to get her to walk and everything . 258400_260840
*PAR0:	so that's why most play is about physical rather than fine play that she gets here . 261200_267700
*PAR0:	so do you play games with her at home or do play . 268960_275000
*PAR0:	Patti how did you get into playing games with Patti yeah . 275000_278260
*PAR0:	we play Peekaboo we play Patti Kate we [/] we [/] we head for Papa last night in the cupboard . 278260_283020
*PAR0:	and jumped out to him when he came home from work . 283020_285600
*PAR0:	and [/] and yeah you know all those sort of the regular peek [/] peek out games high [/] high whereas social games . 285960_297080
*PAR0:	and yeah <a lot> [/] a lot of we do <a lot high> [/] a lot high fives . 297080_305040
*PAR0:	which is not part of really because she and she sort kind of understands it because she sort of stands there with her hands like that . 305040_312460
*PAR0:	but yeah Anna [/] Anna let me &-uh look at I don't . 312880_319800
*PAR0:	she got a bit of a cold today . 319800_320960
*PAR0:	so I don't know whether that's making her quieter . 320960_322980
*PAR0:	okay just a strange place . 324080_325880
*PAR0:	she's really interesting . 327520_328460
*PAR0:	oh she is yeah [/] yeah I know she got her first birthday coming up . 329180_337840
*PAR0:	so I guess she'll get something like that for her first birthday . 337940_341020
*PAR0:	okay . 341840_342260
*PAR0:	&-um were have do you have any of books of one . 342700_347200
*PAR0:	I've got good night moon . 347200_348780
*PAR0:	but in a bigger vesh a bigger version we've got books this size . 348780_352620
*PAR0:	and we've got the lift to flap books like she usually likes . 353080_357440
*PAR0:	she likes to sort of like as you I'm sure other children have l literally l ripped the flaps off . 357440_362820
*PAR0:	we . 363540_363820
*PAR0:	have from the library . 363820_365580
*PAR0:	we have one not exactly the same but it's the same cover and the same you know foam but just you know obviously slightly different pictures . 365580_375220
*PAR0:	&-um yeah . 375220_377680
*PAR0:	so she's used to that sort of booth . 377680_380100
*PAR0:	and that these three really I heard you &-um making animal noises earlier . 380100_389560
*PAR0:	do you do that a lot . 389880_390500
*PAR0:	yeah . 390560_391740
*PAR0:	we were just back from Ireland and &-um in the village where we stayed it's free roaming for the cows and sheep . 391740_399240
*PAR0:	so literally when you're walking down the street you're surrounded by sheep and cows quite regularly . 399400_404180
*PAR0:	so we were sort of working on . 404180_407040
*PAR0:	this is a real sheep rather than a picture of a sheep . 407040_410180
*PAR0:	let's look at the big cow and you know dogs as well . 410360_413200
*PAR0:	and we've got a cat at home . 413360_414600
*PAR0:	so she makes a meow sound and said she can say cat in her language . 414600_420460
*PAR0:	definitely . 420940_421300
*PAR0:	she's definitely referring to the cat . 421300_423380
*PAR0:	mm . 424000_424140
*PAR0:	and so yeah we [/] we kind of it's e it's an easy play thing to do with her . 424480_430500
*PAR0:	you know it's [/] it's lots of songs of animal noises . 430620_433740
*PAR0:	lots of books of animals in it . 434020_435720
*PAR0:	so it's [/] it's she seems all usually quite interested . 435820_439320
*PAR0:	so she was in a wheelchair . 439980_441260
*PAR0:	&-um she I would say . 441920_445400
*PAR0:	yes . 445400_445800
*PAR0:	especially since she was in Ireland a couple of weeks ago because she literally she was in a push chair . 446000_451700
*PAR0:	and [/] and she was looking at her disc you know disc or <she could have> [/] she could have reached out and stroke check . 451700_457160
*PAR0:	&-um and that's obviously a lot more impact than the book . 457880_462720
*PAR0:	so &-um I definitely believe that when we . 463140_466380
*PAR0:	say Bash he looked at the sheep and moo you know but the cows were there as well . 466380_471260
*PAR0:	and you nothing beats real life experience to look at a picture in a book . 472060_479040
*PAR0:	kind of see . 479040_481580
*PAR0:	this is more what she would normally do . 481580_483200
*PAR0:	she would let you get up like that and playing things and buying things . 483320_489700
*PAR0:	so perhaps she's just shy with the new toys . 490620_494300
*PAR0:	and now she's more relaxed . 494300_496200
*PAR0:	now does she like certain textures of clothes to button up cold plastic . 497240_503960
*PAR0:	but I just put that down to the teething . 504100_505860
*PAR0:	you know the [/] the hard plastic is very good to chew on . 506200_508620
*PAR0:	especially like that sort of one that gives you know &-um but everything goes in her mouth . 508720_515640
*PAR0:	so it's hard to distinguish . 515700_516780
*PAR0:	not a book would go in her mouth . 516780_518200
*PAR0:	my bookmark is mine . 518300_519720
*PAR0:	you know anything that's kind of lying around . 519960_522600
*PAR0:	but yeah you know something like that . 522980_524880
*PAR0:	she would chew on rather than just put in her mouth . 524880_528500
*PAR0:	em not [/] not so much soft toys again . 529760_532440
*PAR0:	they'll go in her mouth to start with but they won't stay in there . 532560_535180
*PAR0:	okay . 535740_535800
*PAR0:	and here Puffer check . 536380_540420
*PAR0:	does she eat any of these &-um creams yet . 540780_544060
*PAR0:	yes she [/] she [/] she eats almost everything . 544440_547580
*PAR0:	&-um that looks very like wheat . 547880_550520
*PAR0:	it says Weibach which is &-um twice baked German bread [/] bread . 550560_554700
*PAR0:	and it looks exactly like it . 554700_557260
*PAR0:	and it's probably the same texture as this Weibach because it's quite like peas cheese cold cuts . 557260_564760
*PAR0:	she's never eaten pizza . 564760_565780
*PAR0:	but she's certainly seen us eat pizza . 565780_568400
*PAR0:	so she's never had ice cream . 568400_570660
*PAR0:	but she's seen us have . 570660_571660
*PAR0:	ice cream and [/] and the fruits . 571660_575480
*PAR0:	yeah . 575480_576000
*PAR0:	like peach . 576000_577060
*PAR0:	I say that's a peach and a [/] a pear . 577060_579900
*PAR0:	she's [/] she's had all them . 580420_581700
*PAR0:	and you know I do try and show her the real thing rather than just the pureed version . 581780_588080
*PAR0:	so I think that's everything we need right now . 588320_598220
*PAR0:	so the next visit we added a tea visit . 598220_604420
*PAR0:	it's optional because it wasn't in the original . 604420_608600
*PAR0:	but we decided that it was a little too long of a gap between the eleven month and the two year . 608600_615180
*PAR0:	so . 615180_615940
*PAR0:	&-um okay . 615940_617220
*PAR0:	so if you would like to do that we'll contact you when she's all done . 617540_620400
*PAR0:	yep . 620400_620920
*PAR0:	we have to give her the call . 620940_622100
*PAR0:	and it's actually just this full session &-uh huh have the first part . 622400_626100
*PAR0:	okay . 626360_626780
*PAR0:	just a full session . 627060_627740
*PAR0:	and then the two year visit is a three hour long visit . 628080_631300
*PAR0:	and that's really fun . 631300_633040
*PAR0:	huh . 633480_633620
*PAR0:	and [/] and then you have a play session of that too with &-uh older kids &-uh huh &-uh huh . 633780_639580
*PAR0:	okay . 641180_641800
*PAR0:	okay . 642980_643400
*PAR0:	okay . 643820_644760
*PAR0:	well just get a recall me every two months when I change my mind . 644760_648120
*PAR0:	I don't have my diary for next year yet . 648720_651240
*PAR0:	so . 651240_651480
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah that's fine . 651480_652560
*PAR0:	we don't have anything either . 652560_654600
