@Activities:	Letter writing with mother
*INV:	so what we thought we'd like you guys to do this year is to (.) write a letter [!] to Eric Carle the guy that wrote [!] it &-um and Chi you can have your mom help you .
@Comment:	Time is 0:39:
*INV:	dear Eric Carle .
*INV:	I like the colors in your book .
*INV:	and I like the pictures .
*INV:	I like the cricket book too .
@Comment:	Chi initially refused to write a letter , despite his mother's cajoling. Field notes say he drops his head into his arms and <shuts down>. After his mother was interviewed , however , he agreed to play with magnets and then to write a letter. Mot helps with spelling when Chi asks , but mostly Mot and the EXPs discuss other Eric Carle books and Mot's theories on her own litearcy. Mot misspells colors as colers. Note: EXP mentions the idea of writing about colors , and about liking or not liking things in the book.
