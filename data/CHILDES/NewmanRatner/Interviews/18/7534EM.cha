*PAR0:	and we have some stacking things like that . 52180_55400
*PAR0:	and we [/] we play &-um coffee parties and tea parties [/] parties instead of pretend pour and pretend drink and stuff . 55440_63460
*PAR0:	yeah . 64460_64880
*PAR0:	&-um you haven't had a dolphin in your room . 65180_67600

*PAR0:	oh sorry . 71500_71900
*PAR0:	oh it's okay . 72120_72620
*PAR0:	&-um and do you think that he recognizes any of this play with any of it . 73000_77940
*PAR0:	I think . 78120_79160
*PAR0:	so he really [/] really likes [/] likes peas . 79160_80260
*PAR0:	and that was the first thing he went for . 80260_81980
*PAR0:	&-um I think he does recognize it . 81980_84620
*PAR0:	yeah . 84620_84820
*PAR0:	okay . 85420_85540
*PAR0:	&-um and do you think the animals can eat them . 86460_91080
*PAR0:	you said you knew the names of animals . 91400_92620
*PAR0:	&-um he knows . 92620_95540
*PAR0:	yeah he knows some things like cows . 95540_97500
*PAR0:	I'm not sure if anything here he would know he might know . 97680_99700
*PAR0:	poo . 99700_100060
*PAR0:	&-um so there's a few things . 100060_102740
*PAR0:	but I'm not sure like beaver is kind of too obscure for . 102740_105160
*PAR0:	him &-um do you think that like he played this kind of changed at all from last time . 105160_111100
*PAR0:	&-um my guess is probably yes . 111680_115020
*PAR0:	because I think he's more into books [/] books . 115020_116720
*PAR0:	now he I don't think he really cared much when he was younger . 116720_121300
*PAR0:	and &-um just having more dexterity and more like pretend play instead of you know he can pretend to feed the baby doll and pretend to stack things and stuff . 122780_132920
*PAR0:	so that's I &-um you know he's never really been into stuffed animals much . 133020_155800
*PAR0:	I think that [/] that would be the least interesting . 155940_158800
*PAR0:	and he has been a sort of favorite &-um <I think> [/] I think the fake food probably what do you think the bottle [/] bottle . 159300_175020
*PAR0:	yeah I guess . 175020_176220
*PAR0:	big food . 176220_177060
*PAR0:	okay . 177540_177720
*PAR0:	okay . 178400_178720
*PAR0:	&-um is there anything you'd like to add about . 179060_181080
*PAR0:	&-um no I mean it's [/] it's nice to be able to interact with him a little bit more . 181840_189360
*PAR0:	and to like ask him questions and have him answer . 189360_191600
*PAR0:	so that's been a difference . 191740_193180
*PAR0:	and it's been fun to do . 193180_194340
*PAR0:	does he know a lot of like the animal like the body parts and the animals and all that kind stuff . 195520_199380
*PAR0:	he does . 199420_200200

*PAR0:	<he's not always saying> [/] he's not always saying the words . 202240_205780
*PAR0:	but he [/] he kinda points and runs . 206180_207960
*PAR0:	and I think we can interpret it . 208180_210160
