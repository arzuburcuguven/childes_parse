@Comment:	MOT gives Chi a few suggestons about what to write , but Chi mostly works independently while Mot looks on and comments on Chi's spelling. Mot helps Chi spell a few words , and also enlists Fat's help to spell colors. Mot encourages Chi to sound words out. Mot's ideas are generic: I enjoy the story , found it interesting , etc. Chi comes up with the stuff that is specific to VHC.
