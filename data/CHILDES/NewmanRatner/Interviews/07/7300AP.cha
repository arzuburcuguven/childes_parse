*PAR0:	&-um he [/] he did more than the books . 94360_96920
*PAR0:	&-um like he actually when I was holding the . 97380_100220
*PAR0:	the I think these are the coolest things I've never seen before . 100220_103180
*PAR0:	&-um he actually reached out for it and touched it but then wanted to play with the peanut butter again . 103180_108740
*PAR0:	&-um and like I sat the poo bear in front of him because his nursery is Winnie the pooh . 108740_113440
*PAR0:	&-um and he reached out for it but then went right back to the [/] the hard the pizza and the hamburger and the spoons . 113440_122920
*PAR0:	he really liked the spoons . 123040_124040
*PAR0:	does he ever play with spoons at home or not . 128720_132360

*PAR0:	&-um he's he [/] he started solids a month ago . 141000_144760
*PAR0:	and so he try he always tries to reach out and grab the spoon I'm feeding him with . 144760_148900
*PAR0:	but that's really like the only &-um exposure he's had to spoons really . 148900_154640
*PAR0:	other than watching us eat with spoons . 154640_157040
*PAR0:	but I don't know that he's that aware of we're eating with spoons you know &-um we have let's see . 157040_169060

*PAR0:	and it's &-um I don't know how to describe it . 177640_181440
*PAR0:	it's kind of like a [/] a ball that looks like a cage is the best way to describe it . 181440_186120
*PAR0:	like it's has os all around it . 186120_188400
*PAR0:	that's why they call it an o ball like it's an open air ball that he can actually grab . 188400_192580
*PAR0:	he can get his fingers in between . 192580_194360
*PAR0:	so he really likes that . 194360_195560
*PAR0:	and we have a bunch of like teething toys . 195560_199380
*PAR0:	anything he can chew on . 199380_201020
*PAR0:	he likes anything he can chew on . 201020_203560

*PAR0:	&-um and probably his other favorite is we have a couple of different &-um elephants . 218640_225740
*PAR0:	so it's kind of like a stuffed toy . 226180_227940
*PAR0:	but it's has all kinds of stuff on it . 227940_230280
*PAR0:	like his ears crinkle . 230320_231460
*PAR0:	and there's a teething part on it . 231460_233560
*PAR0:	and &-um it rattles . 233560_236060
*PAR0:	and so it has different sensory things &-um in it . 236060_240660
*PAR0:	so we have a couple of different ones like one in his crib and one in his playpen . 240900_243840
*PAR0:	and he [/] he plays with those quite a bit too . 243920_245560
*PAR0:	yeah those are probably like his favorites . 247420_249200
*PAR0:	we have a handful of different things . 249400_250400
*PAR0:	but he probably goes to those the most so pretty much anything he can put in his mouth . 250400_255740
*PAR0:	and Arararararar likes those hard things . 255740_257600
*PAR0:	mhm . 257600_257960
*PAR0:	but that's why he's going for yeah the food . 257960_261060
*PAR0:	and the maybe they could be the harder plastic . 261060_264440
*PAR0:	yes . 264440_264900
*PAR0:	so I mean I know he's probably isn't playing with dolls at all . 264900_268380

*PAR0:	we go to play groups . 272820_274160
*PAR0:	&-um so he's around other babies quite a bit . 274580_276860
*PAR0:	but as far as like dolls or anything like that we don't have anything like that at home . 277220_281120
*PAR0:	he's kind of oblivious . 281340_282560
*PAR0:	and the clock I know you mentioned something during it . 282820_287200
*PAR0:	he always tries my watch has bling around it . 287400_290640
*PAR0:	and so he's always reaching for my watch . 290820_292600
*PAR0:	and I was telling him that that's mommy's watch . 292660_293980
*PAR0:	we tell time with that watch . 294040_295160
*PAR0:	and so he when I said I'm like that's just like mommy's watch . 295220_297340
*PAR0:	and he like looked up and he saw that clock . 297360_298960
*PAR0:	and he looked at it for a second . 298960_300060
*PAR0:	oh so [/] so I don't know if he made a [/] a connection between mommy's watch <and that clock> [/] and that clock . 300500_307020
*PAR0:	but looked at all of them . 307120_308780

*PAR0:	yeah he might have or he might have when we w walked in he saw that like [/] like the actual clock . 313040_318560
*PAR0:	and &-um so he might have made a connection . 318820_320720
