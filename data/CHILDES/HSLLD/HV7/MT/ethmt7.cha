*CHI:	xxx so important .
@Comment:	Time is 0:06
@Comment:	the tone of this 90 minute mealtime is very playful. Mot and Chi are alone during the time that the table is set , etc , and Fat joins them to eat. Chi talks about a rather odd chess game , a computer program I think. Chi is really irreverent toward , but everything is done with a sense of fun (about cooking hot dogs; don't worry Mom , you can learn a lot from me). There are a lot of long pauses throughout. Before eating , Chi is playing his game , and during the meal there is music playing and Mot is reading the newspaper. I think they continue taping long after they have finished eating. Chi is working on a project for school that involves cutting things out. The assignment , whatever it is , seems silly , but when Chi talks about making an incision and about using a scalpel or butter knife , you just crack up. Precious bit a little over halfway through. Mot wants to check out a camp at MIT. MIT? Computers? No , tennis and sailing. Chi says <I cannot do tennis. I cannot do sailing. But I'd sure like to fool around with computers>. While discussing changing tv schedules , not letting Chi watch a program is mentioned , which is a little surprising considering the peer-like banter between them. Only side 1 of the tape was gemmed and coded for exp and narr talk , since Chi is usually an outlier anyway.
