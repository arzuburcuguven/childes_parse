@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	08-FEB-1994
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	you may remember some of these things .
@Comment:	Time is 13:40
@Comment:	MOT and Chi are compatible with each other and play well together. EXP remains in the background. Although most of the activity is spent building structures and stacking objects , MOT does call Chi's attention to the fact that the nickel won't stick to the magnet and to objects that repel each other. Mot directs most of the conversation by continually asking Chi questions. Video does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
*INV:	we brought them to a visit <a couple> [/] a couple of visits back .
*INV:	but what we'd like you guys to do is to play and talk with them for about ten minutes or so .
*INV:	www .

*MOT:	what_about these legos [= red flat legos] ?
%act:	picks the lego pieces up and then puts them back on the floor
*CHI:	maybe ?
*MOT:	this [= magnet set] is like the one at the doctor's office [>] huh ?
*CHI:	mhm [<] .

*MOT:	0 .
%act:	places another paper clip on top of the second silver stick; the paper clip stays on top of the stick
*MOT:	hm: that's [= paper clip staying on top of the silver stick] what I wanted to do with the other one [= paper clip which slid down the silver stick] .
*MOT:	that's [= referent unclear] weird .
*MOT:	(.) hm: .
*CHI:	(.) (wh)oops !
%sit:	Chi tries to remove a silver piece from the black base; in doing so , Chi moves the base away from Mot who was trying to put the orange man on the silver sticks
*MOT:	think we could hang him [= orange man] from the top [= of the silver sticks] ?
%act:	places each of the orange man's hands on the top of a silver stick
*CHI:	hm: .
*MOT:	nope .
%sit:	the orange man fell
*MOT:	yes I can !
%act:	picks up the orange man and takes the two silver sticks off the black base

*MOT:	wonder if that [= flat silver circle] has something to do with that [= making objects stick to base] .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	places the flat silver circle on the black base
*MOT:	+^ there you go .
*MOT:	it's [= standing the orange man on the silver sticks] not gonna [: going to] work .

%act:	lifts the second silver stick from the horizontal position on the black base
*MOT:	+^ xxx .
*CHI:	can do it [= make orange man stand on silver man] if I got more than one [= silver man] .
%act:	pulls the silver man off the black base and puts it together with three other silver men
*MOT:	(.) hey !
%sit:	in pulling the silver man off the base , Chi moved the black base and knocked the silver stick , which Mot was trying to set upright , down

*MOT:	+^ your mechanical mind would figure that out .
%add:	Chi
*MOT:	(.) feel how these [= referent unclear] fight ?
%sit:	MOT and Chi stack washers and nuts , but this is hard to see in the video because the view of them is blocked by the orange man and silver men apparatus

*MOT:	no .
*MOT:	don't think so !
%int:	sing song
*CHI:	hm: .
%sit:	in trying to fix the silver man-silver stick structure , Chi created a new one: the silver sticks rest on the shoulders of a silver man and on the black base , like a slide , and one silver man remains standing on the two silver sticks
*MOT:	&=yawn .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	puts a silver man on the shoulders of the silver man that remains standing on the two silver sticks

*CHI:	hm: .
*MOT:	I don't know .
*MOT:	I don't know if that star like standin(g) up tall .
%sit:	the purple star , which is on the black base , has fallen several times; Chi has uprighted the star each time it fell
*CHI:	(..) hm: .
%com:	during pause , Chi makes a tower of silver men and silver sticks

%sit:	Chi placed a silver stick on the top silver man and the silver stick fell off
*MOT:	little too far !
*CHI:	(..) &=laughs .
%act:	moves to place a stack of washers on a silver stick but the stick is too wobbly to hold them
*MOT:	I knew you were gonna do that [= try to put washers on silver stick] &=laughs !

*MOT:	can do that with washers on one side .
%sit:	MOT and Chi remove objects from the black base and the yellow wand
*CHI:	I can ?
*MOT:	I don't know .
*MOT:	will the washers do it [= form an arch] ?
*CHI:	probably .

*MOT:	<oh they're [= Mot's two washers]> [<] opposite .
*MOT:	+^ yep .
%sit:	when Mot placed the two washers on the base , they spread away from each other
*CHI:	well [>] maybe I'll just put this [= flat silver circle] here [= on the black base] .
*MOT:	here [<] .
*CHI:	I'm gonna do it [= referent unclear] .
%act:	stacks two nuts on top of the base
*CHI:	(.) what happened to the other ones [= nuts] ?
