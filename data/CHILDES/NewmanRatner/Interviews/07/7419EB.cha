*PAR0:	sure of course we played with &-um it looks like a lot of food &-um different foods &-um bread and waffles and a bottle and pizza and &-um a couple of stuffed animals . 8060_28460
*PAR0:	and she preferred &-um pizza the most in the bottle . 28920_34240
*PAR0:	it's funny that she knew exactly what to do with it . 34380_36040
*PAR0:	so did she take a bottle . 36780_38380
*PAR0:	she does it . 38600_39640
*PAR0:	&-um was a big struggle for her to take a bottle . 39640_41440
*PAR0:	but she finally got the bottle . 41700_43260
*PAR0:	so &-um but now she's like all about the bottle . 43780_47100
*PAR0:	so &-um it's funny that we don't have play food at home . 47700_51920
*PAR0:	so this is brand new to her . 52060_53740
*PAR0:	I think she's kind of taking it all in . 53860_55260
*PAR0:	okay . 56000_56380
*PAR0:	were there some things that were familiar to her either by look or by the names of them . 56880_61060
*PAR0:	I believe the bottle was the most . 61060_62860
*PAR0:	&-um just because she hasn't really had any of the other food . 62860_66380
*PAR0:	so she doesn't know the other foods . 66380_68480
*PAR0:	but she knows what a bottle is . 68840_70340
*PAR0:	and we've just started using a spoon . 70660_72460
*PAR0:	so finding the spoon was interesting and noticing and knowing what to do with it . 72640_79280
*PAR0:	putting in [/] in mouth . 79280_79980
*PAR0:	and well although she puts everything in her mouth . 79980_82160
*PAR0:	so I make them . 82160_84900
*PAR0:	yeah it does . 85040_85560
*PAR0:	so she's starting on food . 85860_87380
*PAR0:	what are you exploring with . 87480_88700
*PAR0:	we have &-uh carrots and green beans and rice cereal . 88880_93840
*PAR0:	&-um the vegetables seem to be the biggest hit right now . 94520_97380
*PAR0:	so &-um but yeah we we're starting a little late on the foods . 98000_103420
*PAR0:	but she has taken to them very easily . 103540_105860
*PAR0:	so I'm very happy with that one . 106220_108160
*PAR0:	excellent . 109620_110820
*PAR0:	yeah . 111360_111560
*PAR0:	did you does do how do you usually play at home when you have toys or books more &-um toys more . 111940_118460
*PAR0:	&-uh we do read occasionally &-um especially with Christopher with her brother . 118460_123600
*PAR0:	we [/] we tend to read &-um a lot of books . 123600_126660
*PAR0:	but she's not into the stories as much as he is right now . 126660_130500
*PAR0:	so she gets fidgety . 130500_132280
*PAR0:	and I usually just let her play explore their the room . 132280_135240
*PAR0:	we have kind of sectioned her off in her own little spot in her space because she does put everything in her mouth . 135780_141700
*PAR0:	his toys . 142380_143180
*PAR0:	I don't want her to be putting in her mouth . 143180_145360
*PAR0:	so we kind of have her in a little area in the playroom . 145740_150280
*PAR0:	and &-um they're just basically two &-uh yoga mats because she when she rolls she lays down on our wood our floors are hardwood . 150440_158520
*PAR0:	so I just don't want her to get hurt . 158520_160280
*PAR0:	so she has basically two mats that she plays on and &-um plays the toys . 160280_164880
*PAR0:	and he doesn't necessarily play with her as much . 164880_169680
*PAR0:	she wants to be more involved with him . 169980_171960
*PAR0:	&-um but I try to equal my time between the two of them because their toys are so different . 172540_177860
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh but she does play with &-um soft toys [/] toys two toys . 179080_184400
*PAR0:	&-um she's got a bunch of toys for Christmas &-uh there's a cookie jar with shapes that she loves . 185180_190540
*PAR0:	and &-um a dog that sings and I don't know does everything under the sun . 190820_196000
*PAR0:	but so &-um but we tend to &-um play with the toys and talk about what she's playing with . 196000_202620
*PAR0:	and try to label everything as she's &-uh she's putting them in her mouth basically . 202620_206920
*PAR0:	you write it's best wishes and boring everything . 208780_210800
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah . 210800_211920
*PAR0:	and it's funny because her brother never put anything in his mouth . 211920_215900
*PAR0:	so it's a complete opposite . 215900_217600
*PAR0:	and I'm not quite sure what to do with it . 217600_220600
*PAR0:	because I'm like . 220600_221060
*PAR0:	wait you're not supposed to put everything in your mouth . 221060_223180
*PAR0:	&-um but she does . 223180_224580
*PAR0:	and so as she explores them we do talk about what she finds and &-um what it's made from if it's like a cookie or whatever you know . 224580_233940
*PAR0:	mm hm things like that . 234180_235080
*PAR0:	so &-um how about the Aztec animals &-uh did [/] did you guys play with those today . 235080_242340
*PAR0:	&-uh we played a little bit with &-uh Winnie The Pooh and the &-um &-um groundhog and the dog . 242720_248200
*PAR0:	&-um we have a our next door neighbor has a chihuahua like this . 248520_253800
*PAR0:	so just something that she sees in our neighborhood . 253980_257260
*PAR0:	&-um groundhogs . 257940_259580
*PAR0:	this groundhog day is coming up in about a month . 260040_261600
*PAR0:	and Winnie the pooh . 261800_263060
*PAR0:	because we have a &-um Winnie the pooh . 263060_267100
*PAR0:	something . 267100_267440
*PAR0:	don't know what it . 267760_268080
*PAR0:	not sure . 268140_268440
*PAR0:	Drodo is a book I think &-um just the things that we again will she'll probably see in her future time the baby doll trying to feed the baby . 268440_278880
*PAR0:	&-um like a we do &-um we feed her . 279560_283100
*PAR0:	so we're trying to show her that how the baby takes the bottle . 283260_285860
*PAR0:	so she interact with her baby . 286640_288100
*PAR0:	&-uh not really no she didn't really have anything to do with her . 288360_293460
*PAR0:	so that's why she went back over here . 293820_295820
*PAR0:	but &-um and the dog and the &-um the other animals . 295980_300180
*PAR0:	she wasn't really into all that much either . 300180_302440
*PAR0:	she test . 302900_303600
*PAR0:	she tasted the dog . 303600_304700
*PAR0:	but that was pretty much it . 305140_306540
*PAR0:	so &-um and she's still trying things out . 307640_311920
*PAR0:	I really think she prefers the [/] the food over everything else . 312080_316060
*PAR0:	the hard stuff plastic . 316180_317760
*PAR0:	but at home we have stuffed animals that she loves to just bite on . 318180_323660
*PAR0:	and that's her thing to do . 324100_326340
*PAR0:	it is a little bit different today . 326340_328800
*PAR0:	and she's more vocal at home . 328800_331480
*PAR0:	I'm not sure why she's so quiet today she's [/] she's been very &-uh quiet . 331480_340420
*PAR0:	usually she's telling me everything . 340420_343800
*PAR0:	and she rolls everywhere . 346080_351300
*PAR0:	right . 354040_355200
*PAR0:	and how were you &-um how were you playing with her . 356880_360500
*PAR0:	&-um just telling her I mean at home or here [/] here [/] here just &-um showing her telling her what the different things are to explore . 361560_372400
*PAR0:	and &-um talking about the different foods the different animals . 372400_377060
*PAR0:	&-um hi yes . 378520_382880
*PAR0:	okay . 383720_383820
*PAR0:	giving her different choices so that she can explore the toys a little bit different than we do at home . 384420_392180
*PAR0:	I guess we know the toys at home . 392180_393560
*PAR0:	so I you know we tend to not I guess I don't explain to her what things are at home as much as I do here because she knows what they are . 393560_405440
*PAR0:	but I did in the past tell her the different animals and things . 405440_408480
*PAR0:	so . 408480_409240
*PAR0:	but here really . 409240_413260
*PAR0:	oh where are you going . 414320_415460
*PAR0:	where are you gonna go . 416940_417820
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 420900_422460
*PAR0:	are you saying . 423000_423740
*PAR0:	hi . 423740_424960
*PAR0:	&-um just trying to explain the foods to her and trying to tell her what the different things are . 424960_433400
*PAR0:	would you also play like you know meaning &-uh no probably not as much as I would probably at all . 434480_442960
*PAR0:	&-um &-um usually some well I would ask . 444140_449820
*PAR0:	for like a bite or you know things like that but not as not like I did today . 449820_456260
*PAR0:	I kinda let her explore them more than I did . 456420_459500
*PAR0:	I would explain to her things . 459500_461400
*PAR0:	yeah different foods . 461400_463460
*PAR0:	that's a key . 463460_464460
*PAR0:	it's a key right . 464460_470320
*PAR0:	oh sorry . 470320_471480
*PAR0:	no it's okay . 471620_472160
*PAR0:	does she have a baby doll in she does not she has &-um just more stuffed animals soft toys than [/] than &-um baby dolls . 472160_479380
*PAR0:	and or do we no we do not no I trying to think . 479500_485700
*PAR0:	no . 485860_486000
*PAR0:	&-um what's something that you would say . 486740_490680
*PAR0:	&-um you try to have her engage in but you didn't really take you squished her . 490680_497280
*PAR0:	&-um I tried to make her a sandwich . 497480_499200
*PAR0:	&-um and she wasn't really &-uh into the pizza of [/] of all the things over here . 499200_534460
*PAR0:	okay . 535640_535740
*PAR0:	I think these are all is there anything about today's session that you wanna &-um mention . 536140_542940
*PAR0:	that's maybe different or similar &-um to home . 542940_546740
*PAR0:	&-um well it's actually completely different than home I think &-um just the [/] the toys and the &-um the materials to use . 547180_555840
*PAR0:	&-um and she's a lot more vocal at home . 556620_559800
*PAR0:	&-um I think maybe because there's always noise going on in the house . 560800_564540
*PAR0:	she has a two year old brother . 565080_566020
*PAR0:	&-um so she's used to &-um a lot more sound . 566560_571300
*PAR0:	so maybe she's a little bit more vocal here . 571380_574060
*PAR0:	it's a lot quieter . 574060_575320
*PAR0:	and &-um it's more one on one . 575720_577420
*PAR0:	and she has more of my time than she usually gets like me . 578360_581260
