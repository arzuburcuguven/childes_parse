*PAR0:	anything that'll fit in her mouth . 16200_17980
*PAR0:	but she does gravitate towards things like this because she's teething . 17980_22420
*PAR0:	so the rougher textures what in particular did . 22420_31100
*PAR0:	she like &-uh the peas the spoon all the spoons in fact . 31100_37520
*PAR0:	and we became especially attached to whatever this is a beaver maybe . 37520_43920
*PAR0:	but I think it looks like her cat which concerns me . 43920_49420
*PAR0:	given that she is like trying to beat the beaver up . 49420_54080
*PAR0:	okay . 54080_57740
*PAR0:	so what do you think she didn't like out of all this . 57740_61140
*PAR0:	&-um I'm trying to think there were a couple things she picked up . 61140_66400
*PAR0:	she does not like whatever . 66400_67240
*PAR0:	these are these block things . 67240_69300
*PAR0:	they're a lot heavier than the other toys . 69300_70880
*PAR0:	and yeah for the most part she kind of stayed away from the soft stuff until the end . 70880_80080
*PAR0:	but and the books were only interesting . 80080_83420
*PAR0:	if we did them together . 83420_86280
*PAR0:	I know you just want the spoon . 86280_90080
*PAR0:	do you read a lot to her at home . 90080_91580
*PAR0:	she reads I had to laugh . 91580_93140
*PAR0:	we have this book at home . 93140_94780
*PAR0:	she has lots of soft books and cloth books and board books and a lot of texture books . 94780_100040
*PAR0:	a lot of books with faces in them . 100040_102360
*PAR0:	the baby faces and her grandparents read to her a lot also . 102360_110300
*PAR0:	yeah . 110300_113020
*PAR0:	don't stick it that far in your throat . 113020_114240
*PAR0:	please . 114240_114600
*PAR0:	thank you . 114600_115260
*PAR0:	I do not want to have to explain to your dad that you choked on a spoon . 115260_119000
*PAR0:	&-um what kind of texture is [/] is does she have with each one . 119000_125220
*PAR0:	&-um I'd say anything that's got . 125220_127320
*PAR0:	I don't know what you want to call this . 127320_129080
*PAR0:	like rough &-uh rougher anything . 129080_132180
*PAR0:	that's &-um not smooth . 132180_135180
*PAR0:	it's gotta have some sort of ridging on it . 135340_137220
*PAR0:	cause I know it feels really good across that top gum where . 137280_139340
*PAR0:	we've got teeth about to come through . 139340_140840
*PAR0:	&-um she'll chew on soft stuff . 141920_143840
*PAR0:	but it doesn't keep her attention as long . 143840_145380
*PAR0:	she goes back to these peas were incredibly popular . 146140_148640
*PAR0:	I think that [/] that bubble ridging was . 148720_151040
*PAR0:	oh . 152420_152640
*PAR0:	and the pizza . 152640_153100
*PAR0:	I didn't realize how textured the pizza was . 153180_155000
*PAR0:	that makes sense . 155000_155780
*PAR0:	now . 155780_156820
*PAR0:	yeah . 156820_158400
*PAR0:	you're gonna have cookie before pizza . 158400_160360
*PAR0:	I'm not at all surprised except that one fits really far in your mouth . 160360_165020
*PAR0:	so I'm gonna take that one away . 165020_166360
*PAR0:	thank you . 166360_166960
*PAR0:	you go you wanna come up here . 166960_170880
*PAR0:	come up here . 170880_172280
*PAR0:	Lucy [/] Lucy is her kitten who's about three and a half months old . 173480_177940
*PAR0:	and she and Lucy play on the floor together all the time . 177940_181020
*PAR0:	and so when she grabbed the beaver that's about the color of the kitten . 181020_186520
*PAR0:	so I wondered if I know does it feel like Lucy it does Lucy's incredibly soft . 186520_191880
*PAR0:	and that beaver's incredibly soft . 191880_193520
*PAR0:	and . 193520_193780
*PAR0:	oh I know . 193780_195380
*PAR0:	no <you cannot have> [/] you cannot have my necklace or my earrings . 195960_201180
*PAR0:	no . 201440_201520
*PAR0:	so <does she> [/] does she get along with him . 202160_204400
*PAR0:	oh yeah she has a hundred and twenty five pound rottweiler and the four pound kitten . 204660_208600
*PAR0:	so she plays with the two of them all day long . 209020_213320
*PAR0:	they play on her &-uh floor mat . 213320_215060
*PAR0:	which is why she was probably in like toy heaven . 215060_216540
*PAR0:	cause she most of the toys she doesn't want . 216540_218320
*PAR0:	she and the cat lay . 218840_219780
*PAR0:	and she pets the cat and pokes the cat and grabs the cat . 219940_222780
*PAR0:	&-um and the cat just lays there . 223620_225400
*PAR0:	and the two of them cat meows . 225480_227420
*PAR0:	and she makes these noises . 227500_229480
*PAR0:	and they talk . 229480_230680
*PAR0:	and you said that &-um she might think the . 230680_237480
*PAR0:	color is similar . 237480_238400
*PAR0:	is she attracted to certain colors would you say . 238400_240780
*PAR0:	&-um at home it tends to be really bright things or things that have any kind of like shimmer to them . 240780_248260
*PAR0:	but that one I just thought was I mean [/] mean that's what color Lucy is [/] is that kind of weird mix of brown and white and gray . 248520_255460
*PAR0:	so I didn't know if there was a connection . 255460_257940
*PAR0:	I was just babbling at her . 257940_265000
*PAR0:	I'm going to go at this point with probably not I think if there was a dog or a cat she might have because we say those although there's a dog here . 265000_274120
*PAR0:	but that definitely doesn't look like hers because we use those words at home a lot . 274120_278680
*PAR0:	but I don't think any of these . 278680_280740
*PAR0:	although she probably knows frog because her whole room is decorated in frogs . 280740_283700
*PAR0:	and she's got easily a dozen stuffed frogs in her room . 283700_289480
*PAR0:	that's very cute . 289480_290760
*PAR0:	yeah that one's good . 290760_291540
*PAR0:	I'll have to go find that one . 291540_293700
*PAR0:	Leah what are you doing . 293700_295380
*PAR0:	are you being a ham . 295380_296640
*PAR0:	are you being ham . 296640_298700
*PAR0:	yeah I know you are . 298700_302700
*PAR0:	do you think she remembered the one book you were looking at . 302700_310200
*PAR0:	I'd like to say . 310200_311660
*PAR0:	yes . 311660_312040
*PAR0:	but I honestly have no idea . 312040_313860
*PAR0:	&-um because this one we don't actually read we just got it a couple weeks ago . 313860_319660
*PAR0:	we just play with all the texture spots in it . 319660_323120
*PAR0:	&-um she might I mean she actually played with it as opposed to a lot of the stuff where I handed it to her . 323120_329580
*PAR0:	and she kind of threw it back at me . 329580_331140
*PAR0:	so she might have recognized that one . 331460_333400
*PAR0:	mm . 335400_335780
*PAR0:	hm . 335780_335860
*PAR0:	yeah what you got now . 336240_339000
*PAR0:	and you don't care now about [/] about the food . 339880_343840
*PAR0:	what do . 343840_344260
*PAR0:	you think she recognized given that everything comes out of a baby food jar . 344260_350760
*PAR0:	the only thing that probably would have made sense was when she went after the bottle . 350760_354100
*PAR0:	which I honestly have no idea what she did with . 354100_355480
*PAR0:	here it is she went after that [/] that . 355480_357000
*PAR0:	I think she probably would have recognized the spoons definitely because I let her play with them while we're feeding her . 357000_362880
*PAR0:	and the peas would have made sense after I told her what they were because we pay we play peas please every day because she has peas with almost every meal because they're her favorite . 362880_373180
*PAR0:	so that when she says if there'd been a banana we might have gotten a response out of her because we play bananas all the time too . 373180_379180
*PAR0:	but <those are the> [/] those are the two that she'd recognize at this point the rest of this is still well outside of the realm of what she's allowed to have . 379180_385800
*PAR0:	maybe next time . 386560_388180
*PAR0:	yeah . 388320_388480
*PAR0:	maybe next time what do you think you gonna have tacos before next time . 388480_393240
*PAR0:	Munchkin and what about &-um noise . 393240_399560
*PAR0:	does she like it . 400600_401560
*PAR0:	this is actually really quiet for her to be playing because at home there'd be either a radio or a tv going . 401560_407620
*PAR0:	and the dog and the cat running around and barking . 407620_410460
*PAR0:	and Chris and I are talking all the time . 410460_412640
*PAR0:	so normally there's a lot more going on when she plays . 412640_416640
*PAR0:	&-um she also doesn't normally sit this long because now that she can crawl she's kind of up and exploring more than playing with the toys around her . 416640_426200
*PAR0:	&-um but she's definitely used to a lot [/] lot more chaos right lots more chaos . 426200_433540
*PAR0:	what about babies . 435080_438440
*PAR0:	does she have any . 438540_439000
*PAR0:	babies at home . 439000_439620
*PAR0:	no yeah I noticed she's still training . 440240_443360
*PAR0:	yeah I don't think we have any dolls out right now . 443360_446260
*PAR0:	I think she's got one or two on her bookshelf . 446260_447700
*PAR0:	so we just haven't gotten down yet . 447700_449260
*PAR0:	she has a puppy . 449260_450640
*PAR0:	it's a power puppy that we plug into the computer . 450640_452600
*PAR0:	and he talks to her . 452600_454080
*PAR0:	and so he says like her name and talks about her favorite foods and sings songs to her . 454080_458400
*PAR0:	but it's a [/] a dog . 458400_459880
*PAR0:	<it's not a> [/] it's not a baby . 459880_461760
*PAR0:	we have animals . 461760_465280
*PAR0:	it's &-um it's like Vtec or something . 465280_468340
*PAR0:	and we she's got a usb cord on her back . 468340_470700
*PAR0:	and if it didn't sound like a boy it would be awesome . 470700_473900
*PAR0:	but &-um Violet talks to her . 473900_476320
*PAR0:	and they sing songs . 476320_477260
*PAR0:	and it's kind of entertaining all things considered . 477260_480800
*PAR0:	if not a little bit creepy . 480800_482860
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 482860_494120
*PAR0:	I mean a lot of the stuff that she plays with at home is like the musical table stuff . 494120_499640
*PAR0:	so there's a lot more lights and sound . 499640_501340
*PAR0:	and I mean she's got a lot of stuff that's just you know like an object to play with . 501340_506440
*PAR0:	&-um not as much real life stuff yet . 506440_509660
*PAR0:	most of it's you know rattles and rings and loops and which I think what else is on her play . 509660_515820
*PAR0:	mat . 515820_517200
*PAR0:	I know whatever . 517200_518100
*PAR0:	she's stolen off the floor . 518100_520360
*PAR0:	found the highlighter there the other day . 520360_522560
*PAR0:	right . 522560_524160
*PAR0:	were you trying to eat the highlighter . 524160_526100
*PAR0:	yeah I know you were . 526100_527120
*PAR0:	okay . 527860_528660
*PAR0:	you can have the spoon back . 528660_529760
*PAR0:	alright . 531840_532580
*PAR0:	sounds good . 532580_533980
*PAR0:	&-um basically next time &-uh we'll ask you pretty much the same questions but we'll see what she likes or dislikes at that point . 534700_542720
*PAR0:	okay . 543000_543020
*PAR0:	and see what she gravitates more towards . 543260_544960
*PAR0:	and . 545240_545380
*PAR0:	we'll compare it to the last visit . 545380_546900
*PAR0:	makes sense pretty much it . 547120_549320
*PAR0:	you wanna come here . 549620_550300
*PAR0:	aw . 550840_552060
