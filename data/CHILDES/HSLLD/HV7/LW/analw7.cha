@Comment:	Time is 1:28
@Comment:	At first Chi is unsure of what to write in the letter , and Mot makes suggestions and allows Chi to decided. Throughout the activity , MOT is encouraging but does not force Chi to write using her suggestions. Mot and EXP carry on a conversation while Chi works independently much of the time. For instance , MOT is surprised at how well-known the author and the book are. She reads out loud to Chi information on the author , hoping that it can get Chi started on the letter.
