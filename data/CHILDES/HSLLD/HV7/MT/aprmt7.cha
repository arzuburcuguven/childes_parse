*MOT:	go to the kitchen around the table Chi .
@Comment:	Time is 0:04
@Comment:	This mealtime lasts for approximately seven mintues. Mot begins tape by asking about the dinner and everyone's day , but when the children do not answer her the way she wants them to , she stops the tape and begins the conversation over again. The dinnertime talk seems very contrived; it is mostly about what they are eating and the math homework that two of the girls have , but the tone of voices are what make it seem artificial as there seems to be this false sense of cheeriness. Almost everytime someone starts to speak , the youngest cousin who is three begins to talk over them. Background noises and voices.
