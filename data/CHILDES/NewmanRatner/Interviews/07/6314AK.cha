*PAR0:	and we just sit and pretend to do you know what I mean she's making us tea and sandwiches and all it was . 37520_41460
*PAR0:	so that was kind of a shock there . 41460_43240

*PAR0:	and she [/] she gravitated right to the all the &-um food . 56260_60860
*PAR0:	and she was very interested in the baby . 60860_62260
*PAR0:	was very surprised by that . 62800_64020
*PAR0:	not the stuffed animals . 64080_65160
*PAR0:	I didn't couldn't get her too interested . 65320_66720

*PAR0:	she doesn't have any of her own yet . 83380_84540
*PAR0:	so she hasn't really been allowed to . 84540_87060
*PAR0:	play with them . 87060_87600
*PAR0:	so that's why I hadn't really seen her do that very much . 87600_91520

*PAR0:	but I didn't get her too interested in that because I pretended to eat with it . 229620_232880

*PAR0:	and it's like small for her hand . 245000_247140
*PAR0:	so as you can see she likes the ice cream . 247140_251540

*PAR0:	like we have a set of like this stuff . 264940_266540
*PAR0:	and it came with plates bowls and forks knives spoons and cups type of thing you mentioned . 266540_272320
*PAR0:	she was interested in the texture . 272320_273580
*PAR0:	there was one in the texture book . 273780_275880
*PAR0:	oh the book . 276100_276740
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah <I had her feel> [/] I had her feel all the pages . 276960_279120
*PAR0:	yeah she did she felt them itime teething so everything [/] everything I can't help . 279300_306320
*PAR0:	but I guess that's a teacher in me . 306320_307420
*PAR0:	and I was telling her what all the sounds animals make too right . 307420_309600
*PAR0:	like she really needs to do that in seven months . 309600_311940
*PAR0:	but that's okay . 311940_314560
*PAR0:	mama tells you anyway right . 314560_316140
*PAR0:	I read this one . 316140_320460
*PAR0:	yeah . 320460_321160
*PAR0:	and these are the two I did . 321160_322140
*PAR0:	yeah Peekaboo &-um yes we play that game with her . 322140_326600
*PAR0:	she hasn't really like she's definitely not playing it back by any means . 326600_332020
*PAR0:	but she laughs because like her sister the older one's three . 332020_335220
*PAR0:	and so she'll play it with her . 335220_336500
*PAR0:	she'll play it a lot with her . 336500_337860
*PAR0:	and she just laughs hysterically . 337860_339180
*PAR0:	she loves that . 339180_339900
*PAR0:	but I don't I'm sure we've had a book like this . 339900_343780
*PAR0:	or I've had it at the library [/] library or something . 343780_345200
*PAR0:	I can't I don't think I've ever read it to her though perfectly honest . 345200_348080
*PAR0:	I think it's the first time I've actually done it with her in a book we've just done it you know physically type of thing . 348080_353160
*PAR0:	but like I said she didn't respond she . 353160_355940
*PAR0:	didn't pay . 355940_356440
*PAR0:	she was more interested in eating I think the waffle when I was reading this one to her than . 356440_359660
*PAR0:	and I she doesn't play it back yet at home either . 359660_362800
*PAR0:	so that kind of didn't surprise me . 362800_364380
*PAR0:	she just thinks it's funny . 364940_366060
*PAR0:	thinks it's hysterical . 366140_366920
*PAR0:	but I guess it's funny when the you [/] you know nurse is doing it versus the book doing it . 367940_373420
*PAR0:	don't know . 373540_373860
*PAR0:	yeah I know she's been seeing it before . 374960_377840
*PAR0:	yeah . 378360_378780
*PAR0:	yeah that [/] that was Winnie the pooh . 379980_381820
*PAR0:	because I know she's seen [/] seen him [/] him before's before because sister sometimes watches that on tv . 381900_385780
*PAR0:	and then I did I tried the puppet with her too . 385780_387860
*PAR0:	I tried this one I did this guy to her . 387860_390800
*PAR0:	and he nibbled on her ears . 390800_392160
*PAR0:	but she was she just ignored me . 392160_393820
*PAR0:	see she just kind of kept playing with what she was playing . 393820_396140
*PAR0:	I think it's the texture and the noise . 396140_403040
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah we don't have this exact set but we do have these plastic keys . 403040_406960
*PAR0:	yeah . 406960_407240
*PAR0:	yeah we have a cat . 407240_411720
*PAR0:	yeah we have a cat . 411720_413480
*PAR0:	so yeah that was just because it was pink . 413480_415560
*PAR0:	it looked like a girlish thing that was all in there . 415560_418020
*PAR0:	we don't have a dog [/] dog in there . 418020_419020
*PAR0:	so [/] so I [/] I think [/] think I [/] I said [/] said to [/] to her [/] her look [/] look it's [/] it's a [/] a book [/] book . 419020_420960
*PAR0:	but [/] but no [/] no we [/] we do [/] do not [/] not have [/] have a [/] a dog . 420960_422140
*PAR0:	and she had does notice the cat though I mean when he walks in the room she just kinda stops . 422220_426760
*PAR0:	and st she'll watch she'll follow him with her eyes you know to see where he's going . 426760_430860
*PAR0:	she's fascinated . 431220_432080
*PAR0:	by him both the girls s they were they're fascinated by him . 432080_435180
*PAR0:	he [/] he couldn't it's a boy he couldn't care less about them . 435260_437080
*PAR0:	and he pays them no attention . 437560_439440
*PAR0:	they think he's fascinating . 439660_442060
*PAR0:	and if she gets close enough she'll grab a handful of fur you know . 442060_447120
*PAR0:	but usually he doesn't go close enough to him . 447120_449220
*PAR0:	he's older . 449220_449980
*PAR0:	he's &-uh ten now ten or eleven . 449980_453160
*PAR0:	he's older . 453160_453920
*PAR0:	so yeah he was around way before the girls . 453920_458120
*PAR0:	so he was like . 458120_460540
*PAR0:	why don't you get them . 460540_461960
*PAR0:	you know he kind of has that attitude . 461960_464180
*PAR0:	what did we need them for . 464180_465740
*PAR0:	I was king of the house . 465740_467960
*PAR0:	now we have these two little princesses running around . 467960_472020
*PAR0:	are you smiling . 472020_473640
*PAR0:	say . 473640_473820

*PAR0:	are you giving out smiles . 477300_479740
*PAR0:	I don't know if I misheard it . 479740_481460
*PAR0:	but you mentioned skitties or something like that . 481460_484440
*PAR0:	sissy . 484560_484820
*PAR0:	oh sissy was sissy . 484820_486260
*PAR0:	okay . 486260_486800
*PAR0:	I thought I heard a skitty . 486800_487900
*PAR0:	no . 488600_489000
*PAR0:	we don't use the word skitty . 489000_490140
*PAR0:	okay . 490280_490400
*PAR0:	maybe it was sissy . 490400_491240
*PAR0:	okay . 491640_491840
*PAR0:	okay . 491840_492280
*PAR0:	I just misheard it . 492280_493160
*PAR0:	yeah probably because that's a we they call it sissy big sissy little sissy . 493380_497560

*PAR0:	and we don't use skinny for anything . 499360_500780

*PAR0:	sissy . 505760_506140
*PAR0:	it was probably sissy . 506140_506980
