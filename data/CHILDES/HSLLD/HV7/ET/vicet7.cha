@Date:	24-FEB-1995
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	this is a (.) video .
@Comment:	Time is 16:11
@Comment:	MOT and Chi work together fairly well. Chi's older Bro , older Sis , and Bro's friend (FRE) are also present at this activity , for the most part watching Chi and Mot and commenting on what they do , and sometimes joining in. It is sometimes very difficult to distinguish between Bro and FRE , but it is certain that Bro talks much more than FRE. Sis contributes science talk during the activity by explaining that the penny won't stick because it is copper and talking about the north and south sides of magnets. At one point Bro attempts to bring a compass into the activity but Mot sends him away. There is some science talk between Mot and Chi but it is not as explicit as the contributions of Sis.
