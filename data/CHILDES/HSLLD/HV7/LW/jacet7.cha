@Comment:	Time is 12:35
@Comment:	Chi is the dominant actor with the magnets , and Mot , Chi and EXP share air time equally. Chi really seems to enjoy the magnets , and Mot and Chi do various activities with them: building and experimenting. Experiments center around magnetizing a silver stick and paper clip , and moving objects with the magnets without actually touching the objects. EXP plays a key role in the experimentation; she asks questions and focuses on questions that are asked by Chi. Mot talks amiably and supportively but speaks little about the scientific qualities of magnets.
*INV:	and if you don't mind we are going to video tape your hands ?
