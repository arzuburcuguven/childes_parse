@Comment:	Chi sits on a couch and looks at the book a while. Mot sits on a chair across from Chi and gazes on. Bro comes in with a hockey helmet and wants Chi to help. Chi keeps reading and then closes the book and goes right to writing the letter. He writes without help from Mot , as Mot and EXP talk with Chi's siblings. MOT talks to Bro quietly in the background. At 3:00 Chi can be heard writing. Notes say Chi looks up pensively for a second while writing , then goes back to work.
