the speakers not very good in it
excuse me
not a very exciting mealtime tape for them
no fights or arguments
i shoulda hid it
next time ill hide the tape recorder
theyll know what real meal is like
this is the first peaceful hot meal ive eaten in a long time
i guess we could tape it every day
thats what we should do
see you you
well the first thing -um id like you and your mom to do is
dear mister eric carle
i like your book called a very hungry caterpillar
it was funny the way the caterpillar ate more and more food as the days went on
i also liked how the caterpillar got bigger after he ate all the food and when he grew bigger he got sick
it was sad that the caterpillar got sick but it was on him because he ate so much
i enjoy reading your book
sincerely chi
you know sometimes after
actually this may seem a little young for you because we didnt visit you in ninety three
-um i think there was bad weather and whatever it got canceled
so this was really things that we had kids do like two years ago
but if you could just humor me it would be helpful
but you know sometimes after having read a book -um people write to the author
and i know that youve read this book
does that look familiar
the very hungry caterpillar by eric carle
and id like you and your mom to write a letter to eric carle
and what were gonna do is we have his home address and were gonna send all the letters -um that the kids have written were gonna going to send them to mr carle and -um
heres some paper
you dont have to use all of it but thats theres just an extra sheet if you n need it
look at that ten minutes
about how we enjoyed the book
-um you can write whatever you want
its just a letter to to him and anything anything that you guys wanna put in it is is fine
its really up to you
you wanna read it or you want me to read it so you remember
well it starts off with do you remember for my sister christa
i loved all the pictures all the time
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf
oh heres the moon heres the leaf
okay you see the moon and the leaf
this is what i useta do when you were little wheres the moon
wheres the leaf
wheres the little egg
on sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg come a tiny and very hungry caterpillar
he started to look for some food
on monday he ate through an apple but he was still hungry
on tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry
on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry
on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry
on friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry
on saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one ice cream cone one pickle one slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon
that night he had a stomachache
the next day was sunday again
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better
now he wasnt hungry anymore and he wasnt a little caterpillar anymore
he was a big fat caterpillar
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself
he stayed inside for more than two weeks then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and he was a beautiful butterfly
so what do you what do you think
well did you like the story
i like it because after he ate all that junk food that he shouldnt of eaten
well some of its good for you but not to eat it all at one time
then he ate the leaf thats nutritious for you he felt better
maybe hell think about that next time he wants to eat all of those things at once
i mean theres nothing wrong with an icecream cone and cake and watermelon but to eat it all at one time
i dont think id wanna try it
now how -um far along do you -um study the children
well -um were waiting right now to hear about more funding
so if we dont get that this this visit will probably be the last one
-um but if we do we you know wed like to continue as long as we could

and it becomes a queen
now i would like you tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess
in other words what are some key strategies that every good player should know

so you play a computer everyday and you also play a person
so you play everyday
now tell me why you enjoy chess
so you like to use mathematics when you play
i am not too familiar with the game of chess
you probably know a lot more about it than i do
so i would like you to explain some things to me
first of all how many people may play a game of chess at one time
four is the most
i have heard of simultaneous matches

so we did all the checking well just start with some general type general questions before we talk about chess
im going to ask you some things about you get this tape recorder going and everything

do you have a favorite tv show or movie

have you read the books even though you dont like them
the first ones i thought they did a better job of getting right to the
and then the later ones they got fatter and fatter and fatter and it took them a long time to get to the point
i think youre right

oh is that like the alex rider ones
now im going to ask you some questions about chess
how long have you played
how old were you when you first started
who taught you how at four
is he good
are you better than he is now
he wont
does your mom play
any of your friends
but you belong to the club right
do you have a rating
what is it
twelve hundred something
thats pretty good
youre only eleven
do you have a besides your dad who taught you how do you have a coach
colin and chuck
can you tell me a little about them
how well do they play
what do they do
so your chess club is here
does it have a name
thats right youre in fifth grade right
thats right this school starts with sixth grade right
what school are you in
so you belong to the chess club that meets here
does it have unintelligible
so how often do you play chess like in a week
every day
does the club meet every day
unintelligible who do you play with most
whos your favorite competitor
unintelligible whats his rating
how about colin do you play with him
is he older than you are
but devin is well matched with you
its good to play with someone whos a little better right
you were just telling me about playing on a computer but what is that like
is it better than a person or not as much fun
do you set up special situations or do you play like a whole game
what kind of problems
do you know any famous chess players
how do you know about him
why do you play it why do you like it
did you see that movie about bobby fischer
what did you think about it
did you like it
no action but they had rapid chess in washington park
thats not action
what kind of action do you want in a chess movie
do you like action movies
like car chases and things like that
whats the last movie you saw that you really liked
maybe you dont like action movies anymore maybe you like -um chess movies
now i want you to explain chess
can you do that
can you try
i am gonna ask you some questions to start you off
well just try to figure it out
i know what a chess board looks like with the blacks and the reds
and its what twelve squares across the top
how many people play chess just two
what about simultaneous matches
have you ever seen that
what happens with that
have you been in any kind of tournament like that
for practice
who does that your coach
which one
they both do
what is that what is a simultaneous match
how many boards at once usually
what happens to the people he comes by and does something on your board and then youre ready but hes not there
you have to wait till he comes back
do you usually have a move real quick or do you does it take you some time to figure out
tell me about the different pieces
now i know theres pawns right
those are lined up on the inside row right
checkers id be better at
you can tell sue all about it because she really doesnt know how to play
why dont you tell her all the details okay mason
okay so if they move one they can still only move one
how do you know if youre gonna move them one or two
okay and then what
okay whats behind the pawns
in that order
whats the better color
is there a better color
they go first
who decides who goes first
how do you decide whos white
what if youre just playing with your friend
do you hide them behind your back
when youre playing chess what would your goals be
what are you trying to do
how do you do that
did you guys talk about all the pieces and how they all move
no we didnt
go back then
kind of an l shape
and the bishop unintelligible
what about the king and queen
it cant jump
but it can move diagonally
can it do the same moves as a
oh but not like a not like a knight though
and the king
so thats why its easy to get it checkmated
its not that easy
whats the most important piece
because she can move in so many ways
so when youre playing now you said you want to have checkmate
but do you kind of want to get the queen if you can
is that something you try to do
they keep her out of danger
how do they do that the other pieces
like alice in wonderland off with their heads
so tell me about the rules
were starting
okay so im white
do i take one of my pawns
oh because he can jump over the pawns
so which one do i want to do
do i start in the middle or do i start on the sides
i think i know that
so then one how close am i to the other side
if i move up two
so were stuck
so i move two and he moves two and were all stuck down the board
it is
so i move my guy out two and then what do you do
facing me
maybe we should have you be going first then what do you do
say youre white
you moved your guy out twice and i moved my guy out two now what
oh how do you know you could reach my pawn
so how would you attack it
one youre right we need a board
so how far are you then from my pawn
so youre like right next to me pretty much
yeah all right so were kind of getting back on that now you know i dont know how to play so what would you tell me so that id be prepared so im not just sitting around going “why did you move that guy”
well picture it in your mind
ill try
okay then what
like getting the knight out
okay and then what
how do you promote the pawn
if i get him to your side there then he can be a different piece
okay which is the best piece
so you can have two queens
is that basically what i need to know if i wanna play you
what are some other things to tell her
what if its someone whos never played before
what else could you tell her unintelligible
now youve just told me something i dont think i ever knew before
theres points in chess
if you take them
i thought it was just basically taking pieces until you got down to the king
i didnt know you could add up points thats very interesting
so is there a score you have to try to reach
so why do you have points
hmm im confused how does that work
did you ever play five minute chess
what if what if youre in a situation where you just have so much time and you dont check each other then do the points matter
can you tell us about that
now ive talked to some people who tell me about that theres certain kinds of strategies certain ways you can play certain things you try to do when youre playing chess
do you have certain strategies you like to use
try i want to hear about it
whats the name of one strategy
what can you say about en passant
is that a strategy
thats a move
unintelligible couldnt do that
ive heard of a strategy of trying to get to the center of the board
is that a good strategy
tell us about that unintelligible
now is that what you called the middle game
so whats the middle when do you get to the middle game
how do you know when youve gotten to that point
is it after all the pawns are moved unintelligible
and theyre all moving around on the board things are happening
so how long does it usually take you to play a game
oh do you sometimes have set times
you play with a clock
how does that work
do you have a limited amount of time to make a move
so thats what unintelligible you were saying about a five minute game
can we talk a little more about the strategies
is there another one
you explained that really well
you did explain that really well
unintelligible that was about getting the pieces in the center of the board
what were the other ones
can you think of one more strategy
what would you defend yourself from
what about endgame strategies
tell me about that
okay and then it can be another piece
yeah can you have anything you want
aha that would be dumb wouldnt it
they have a lot less power
did you ever do that
you dont it doesnt get that far because you check someone
how many moves till you get to an endgame if you dont have check
because you said a middle game is twelve to fifteen moves
so you could end a game in the middle game
so what how do you get to the endgame
how do you know youre there
now you this is a game where you have to think ahead right and you have to try to guess what the other person would be doing
is that how you would either attack or to defend you wanna try to figure out what is happening
how many moves ahead do you try to plan
how hard is it if somebody does something that you dont expect and you have to change your mind plan
so what how sometimes games can be very long though right
bobby fischer i remember played for
didnt they play for a couple of days
unintelligible whats the longest it can go on
whats the shortest it could be
what is the what is the unintelligible
how would they mess up
has that ever happened to you when youre playing
youd be tough to play
it would be hard to beat you
okay so tell us about the chess clock
what else
you know what whats a blunder
how do you how do you unintelligible
now that would be a big blunder
but why do they call it a blunder
like “duh ” that sort of thing
unintelligible id be so embarrassed if i did that
so thatd be the kind of thing where you werent seeing that you moved a piece unintelligible
what else what else would i need to know
obviously it would be better for me to play with somebody whos better than i am right because thats how id learn
not too much better because then why
id get beat
and the person beating me is bored right
so how do i get better
what do i do
puzzles like the ones in the newspaper
have you seen the ones in the newspaper unintelligible
how do you what is the do you know the markings the notations
how does that work
oh okay
is that algebraic notation
let me ask you do you know what a sicilian defense is
what is that
oh unintelligible does that help you win
what other things like that are there that you can do
is that an opening the sicilian defense
what else is there
what one do you use mostly
how does the bishops opening go
do you usually win when you play people
have you played in any serious tournaments like in portland
howd you do in your last tournament
were they kids your age older
did you gain rating points
i guess you have to win most of your games
sounds like youre doing really well with chess
unintelligible is there anything else you want to tell us about chess
do you have a chess set
is it a special one
are they wood or plastic
what does that mean its heavier on the bottom
yeah they put lead inside of them so it doesnt get knocked over easily
cool sounds great

can you tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move
what are the goals of chess
what are the players trying to do

once youre comfortable with the rules what are some key strategies that every good player should know
how long does it usually take to play a game of chess
is that what makes it take so long

and now im going to ask you about chess
how long have you played chess
and how old were you then when you first started to play
who taught you how
do you have a chess rating
so you have a chess coach or teacher
tell me about him or her

is it your own class that goes or your chess group
or is it just anybody who shows up
can you name any famous chess players
you just like the game
have you ever played chess on a computer
what was that like
ah the computer was too smart outsmarted you
now why do you like it
what makes it good for you
why did you choose it
is it challenging
are they older or younger
have they been playing longer
now im not really familiar you can probably tell with the game of chess
youve been playing for one year
and you probably know a lot more about it than i do
so id like you to explain some things to me as if you were telling me about it
so first of all how many people can play a game at one time
is that what would be called a simultaneous match
is that it
and how do you do that
i can understand playing one on one
but how would you do that with so many people
what happens
and whats an end game
so its as if you were getting toward the end of the game
tell me about the different pieces
you mentioned the pieces
and i know they all have great shapes and different names and how they move
tell me about that
ive also heard of castles
what are they
now what exactly is the goal of chess
what are you trying to do when youre playing
can you explain those to me
when would you play blackout
what are the rules that players follow
tell me everything you can think about about chess
if i wanted to sit down and play how would you tell me what i have to do
how do you start
start from the beginning
how do i set up my pieces
but they move forward
for opening
in a straight line because they go in a straight line
and thats the end of the game
and thats what youre aiming for
you told me a little bit about this
but maybe you can tell me some more
what do you do in order to win the game
what are some of the strategies
you mentioned that a little bit before
what are some the strategies in end games
what would you do if you have a king and two rooks
and the other guy has a king and a bishop
how would you make them move to make it checkmate
how would that happen
what happens with the other guys bishop
i mean isnt he trying to do the same thing to you
any other kinds of strategies like that
that sounds pretty cool
how long does it usually take to play a game
if you dont do blitz or just end games how long would it take
does it ever take longer than that
ive heard of games sometimes where theyve taken days
is that possible
how would that happen
how could that be
but if you could do it in ten or thirty minutes what does it take to make it go for six days
i know you just sort of mentioned this
do you know how to use a chess clock
and if you run out of time
i actually skipped one question here
we talked about what makes a game last a long time
but what could make it end really quickly
does that happen a lot
how does your teacher do
does he have a ranking
what else can you tell me about chess
how do you get better
do you play with any of your do you play with your sister or your mom
howd she do
