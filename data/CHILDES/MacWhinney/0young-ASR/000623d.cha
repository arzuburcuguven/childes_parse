*FAT:	so I haven't been recording him . 1270065_1271445
*FAT:	about the only time he really did a lot of talking was on our backpack trip where he did a lot of B bop [/] bop just a little while ago . 1272575_1281725
*FAT:	however we got into a session where he did clicks . 1281725_1285005
*FAT:	and I did clicks . 1285005_1285885
*FAT:	and that was kind of fun . 1285905_1286965
