@Comment:	MOT tells Chi he doesn't have to write the letter in cursive , but he decides to do so anyway. Mot helps Chi with the spelling and punctuation of the greeting , and gives him many ideas about what to write. She tells him that Eric Carle might write back! Mot helps Chi make some of his letters , for example <I> and p. She is attentive to Chi throughout the task. She makes corrections as Chi works and very often tells him what to write.
