@Comment:	At Mot's suggestion , task starts out with a semi- competent reading of VHC by Chi. Mot provides word when Chi stumbles. When writing letter , MOT provides most of text , and spells some words. But Chi is not helpless , and completes much of the dictation herself. Chi is patient and complient , but barely says a word during this task.
