*PAR0:	because you don't want to get it really wet . 264060_266380
*PAR0:	I'm assuming it doesn't really help that much . 266380_268600

*PAR0:	so there was that . 285800_286740
*PAR0:	and I'm gonna break it foods you said she might recognize peas but probably not the other things . 286740_292740
*PAR0:	yeah . 292860_293120
*PAR0:	I don't think she's seen any of the other stuff . 293120_295940

*PAR0:	mhm . 331120_331260
*PAR0:	&-um I think I I'm not sure she can play with books at daycare . 331380_334820
*PAR0:	I can say a read is to her . 334900_336560
*PAR0:	&-um and then as far as stuffed animals I know she has a stuffed her own stuffed animal in her crib at daycare but I don't know [/] know if [/] if they [/] they have [/] have . 337220_343160
*PAR0:	ones [/] ones for [/] for all [/] all of [/] of the [/] the kids [/] kids I [/] I would [/] would imagine [/] imagine they [/] they have [/] have food [/] food . 343160_346300
*PAR0:	I [/] I [/] I don't [/] don't I [/] I really [/] really don't [/] don't know . 346660_348300
*PAR0:	yeah for this age not . 348300_349640
*PAR0:	mm . 349640_349960
*PAR0:	yeah it depends on like half the time they keep her in with the babies . 349960_352900
*PAR0:	and other times they put her with the big kids depending on how many kids are there that day . 352900_356520
*PAR0:	so &-um I don't know . 356520_358320
*PAR0:	yeah . 358320_358880
*PAR0:	oh you found something else you wanna go do . 358880_360320
*PAR0:	okay . 360320_360640
*PAR0:	go ahead . 360640_361160
*PAR0:	okay . 361360_362360
*PAR0:	&-um and yeah you probably answered you probably heard these questions and probably answered almost all these before I even asked you if you know the routine . 362360_372640
*PAR0:	so today would you say she was interested in the books least of all &-uh yeah probably today . 373480_381400
*PAR0:	okay . 382020_382340
*PAR0:	and you said in her second visit she was not well . 383340_385500
*PAR0:	so she just didn't really wanna play . 385600_386900
*PAR0:	yeah . 386920_387060
*PAR0:	she just really didn't wanna do anything . 387060_388900
*PAR0:	and she didn't do the test very well . 389360_392120
*PAR0:	&-uh she was fussy [/] fussy . 392640_394040
*PAR0:	and yeah [/] yeah but it's fun . 394040_396120
*PAR0:	but that moves . 396340_396920
*PAR0:	look at that . 396940_397480
*PAR0:	oh my gosh . 397680_398240
*PAR0:	bubbles but you know sorta how she plays in general . 398540_402460
*PAR0:	and two weeks ago between two weeks ago let's say the way she plays at home . 402620_406340
*PAR0:	and now would you say there are any changes . 406340_409240
*PAR0:	&-um just [/] just in general or how she played last time versus this time . 409240_412940
*PAR0:	well last time I know she was ill .
*PAR0:	so it just in general . 412940_415320
*PAR0:	then . 415320_415940
*PAR0:	no . 415940_416440
*PAR0:	mm-mm no . 416440_417200
*PAR0:	she &-um same sort of stuff . 417200_419700
*PAR0:	she she's really oh really [/] really close to walking . 419700_422740
*PAR0:	so she's been she's . 422740_424180
*PAR0:	more interested in like standing up and climbing and using her little walker . 424180_428240
*PAR0:	or she has like a little push thing that she walks around . 428240_430540
*PAR0:	so she and maybe that's why she's less interested in the books right now because she's trying to walk . 430540_436560
*PAR0:	so probably . 436560_438100
*PAR0:	yeah probably . 438100_439500
*PAR0:	yeah well I think done . 439500_444980
*PAR0:	yay . 444980_445780
