*PAR0:	okay . 0_2660
*PAR0:	I'm ask you some questions . 2660_4440
*PAR0:	now . 4440_5040
*PAR0:	sure . 5040_5440
*PAR0:	I'm not going to write anything down because we're just going to transcribe it from the recording . 5440_9580
*PAR0:	okay . 9580_10480
*PAR0:	okay . 10480_11960
*PAR0:	so which of the toys seemed to interest Joey the most . 11960_16860
*PAR0:	&-uh at this time around probably all the plastic stuff . 16860_21720
*PAR0:	oh yeah all the plastic stuff . 21720_23020
*PAR0:	yeah . 23040_23340
*PAR0:	okay . 23900_24240
*PAR0:	especially this bottle which is funny because he doesn't use a bottle . 24560_28060
*PAR0:	he never no he a bottle . 28220_30480
*PAR0:	&-uh why do you think they interest him . 30820_33240
*PAR0:	&-um well frankly because I think he's teething . 33400_37840
*PAR0:	and so they're hard and plastic . 38280_39900
*PAR0:	so he could put them in his mouth . 39900_41560
*PAR0:	&-um what do you think is a good toy for his personality out of these toys . 42180_50640
*PAR0:	yeah . 50980_51120
*PAR0:	&-um well I would have thought that the wooden hard wooden things are because they're kind of he's really into balls right now . 51600_63440
*PAR0:	and they roll . 63440_64140
*PAR0:	so I thought he would be more into those . 64140_66400
*PAR0:	and they're also they make noise which he likes to do . 66400_69240
*PAR0:	&-um so that's what I would have thought . 69240_72680
*PAR0:	but that wasn't didn't really seem to be the case . 72680_75100
*PAR0:	&-um let's see which of the toys seemed to interest him the least . 76240_81540
*PAR0:	&-um this time around I would say the books . 81540_84420
*PAR0:	okay . 84420_86300
*PAR0:	why do you think that is &-um I think because for him books are he likes particular books that he knows already . 86300_97920
*PAR0:	and since all of these things are new they were just probably the least interesting . 97920_106320
*PAR0:	I don't know if that makes sense . 106320_107700
*PAR0:	there are any items here that his interest in have changed since the last time you were here . 107700_112980
*PAR0:	or do you remember what he played with . 112980_114860
*PAR0:	the last visit . 114860_115420
*PAR0:	I . 115420_116800
*PAR0:	don't really remember . 116800_119740
*PAR0:	I kind of feel like he was a little bit more into the stuffed animals last time . 119740_125640
*PAR0:	mm . 125760_125800
*PAR0:	that makes sense . 125800_126440
*PAR0:	&-um but I'm not I don't know if that's true . 126460_129180
*PAR0:	and I would say that the [/] the baby was seemed he was kind of interested in it . 129340_136620
*PAR0:	but he didn't really follow through on anything . 136660_138480
*PAR0:	don't I thought that he if he would be more interested . 138940_141740
*PAR0:	okay . 142380_142600
*PAR0:	like maybe interested in why his pants fit like that . 142880_145600
*PAR0:	what's going on . 146120_149300
*PAR0:	&-um okay . 149580_152040
*PAR0:	so which book do you think he would prefer to read or look at with you . 152040_156620

*PAR0:	okay . 171060_171640
*PAR0:	does he play with similar toys at home . 172120_174640
*PAR0:	&-um at home we have several balls &-um that he plays with . 175640_180560
*PAR0:	and then we have his the suite of expensive toys like the plastic bottle and the cl empty kleenex boxes and the empty root beer can thing . 180680_189020

*PAR0:	he also has so the balls and things . 199860_205100
*PAR0:	and then he also has blocks that he plays with a fair amount . 205100_210720
*PAR0:	and those he likes to carry around and bang and make noises . 210720_214260

*PAR0:	you know . 239200_239800
*PAR0:	oh &-um I don't know . 239800_245840
*PAR0:	I &-um he's got several go-to books that will he brings over to have me read them or to drop them near me . 246800_259440
*PAR0:	anyway . 259440_259840
*PAR0:	&-um but he is he's the toys that he's into . 259840_264760
*PAR0:	he's really into his toys . 264760_266020
*PAR0:	don't know how to answer that question . 266900_268000
*PAR0:	does he play with dolls at home at all . 268400_272160

*PAR0:	no we only have real food at home . 283580_287840
*PAR0:	I t to encourage him to eat things that aren't actually food because he has a tendency to do that . 288400_295560
*PAR0:	so do you think that he recognized any of the foods like from &-um . 295560_302700
*PAR0:	I don't know probably not for the bottle . 302700_310060
*PAR0:	&-um I mean he his solid foods all look kind of orange and mashed together still . 310060_319660
*PAR0:	so I don't think that he would recognize that these are peas I mean maybe but not in this shape . 319660_326920
