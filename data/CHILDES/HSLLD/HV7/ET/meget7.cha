@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	10-NOV-1993
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	and now we have another task for you to do which (.) might seem a little familiar .
@Comment:	Time is 14:25
@Comment:	Chi and Mot don't really play together at all; Chi plays while Mot looks on. Still , there is a pleasant atmosphere and Mot seems to be proud of Chi. The only mention of the properties of magnets is when Mot says <remember the different sides of a magnet , Chi>. Chi experiments a little with the magnets on her own , noticing when certain pieces don't stick. EXP's participation , through comments and laughter during particular situations , isn't extensive but it is almost as much as Mot's. Video does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
*INV:	www .
@Comment:	Time is 14:35. Set up of and introduction to magnet activity , some talk about videotaping; tells them it will just be their hands; Mot and EXP have a conversation about videotaping and the camera; Chi enters occasionally with comments
*CHI:	ah to play with .
@Comment:	Time is 16:08
*INV:	to play with !
