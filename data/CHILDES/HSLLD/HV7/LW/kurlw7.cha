*INV:	dear Eric .
*INV:	I just got done reading your book .
*INV:	I thought it was funny when the caterpillar ate through all the food .
*INV:	my name is Firstname too .
*INV:	I have a sister , a cat too .
*INV:	I liked your book and I hope I grow up and write stories like you .
*INV:	your friend Chi .
@Comment:	Chi rereads the entire book before he begins to write. Mot gives Chi the first sentence , but the rest is all Chi's work. Mot prompts Chi occasionally about the proper form for letters , and Chi responds correctly. Mot by and large does not correct Chi's work (such as spelling too with one o). Chi asks Mot for a few spellings , which Mot provides. For the most part , Chi writes silently. Chi asks a few times if some of his ideas for what to write are okay , to which Mot replies very supportively. Interaction between Mot and Chi is very quiet , very supportive , very gentle. Chi writes in cursive , has a little trouble reading his own writing.
