*PAR1:	I didn't want him to be disorganized like she is . 35525_37765
*PAR1:	and &-uh I said . 38585_40125
*PAR1:	aha Ross you caught me . 40305_42165
*PAR1:	and I explained that &-uh about how when Mary was young her mother didn't help her in learning organizational skills . 42165_50165
*PAR1:	and &-uh then &-uh Ross listened to all this and talked back and forth about it . 50985_58235
*PAR1:	and then he said . 58235_58955
*PAR1:	&-um and then I tried I [/] I said . 59455_65265

*PAR1:	oh is that the reason . 79145_79985
*PAR1:	okay . 80135_80425
*PAR1:	and &-uh I said . 81205_84495
*PAR1:	why don't you talk to mom and see if she agrees with me . 84495_86735

*PAR1:	just try it sometime and see what she says . 105825_107545
*PAR1:	anyway then he sort of quieted down for a little bit . 108325_110265
*PAR1:	and we got home . 110265_110825
*PAR1:	and he said . 110845_111785
*PAR1:	I don't see why . 114805_115525
*PAR1:	I can't think my mother's the most wonderful person in the world . 115605_118125
*PAR1:	and I said . 118825_119405
*PAR0:	well . 120435_120725
*PAR1:	she is &-uh but you know let's see . 121105_126145
*PAR1:	I said . 129455_129775
*PAR1:	I [/] I don't see why I can't think mother's perfect . 129815_131615

*PAR1:	at that point . 139635_140295
*PAR1:	I think I gave up the argument clearly having been defeated . 140415_143095
*PAR1:	&-uh anyway that's the first use in Ross of an argument &-uh saying that you know . 143795_149295
*PAR1:	well don't you think that you da [/] da [/] da [/] da that I've [/] I've ever really seen in other words it's prop appropriate for me to feel the feelings I feel since I am going to hereby claim that I bet you felt them too . 149295_161895
*PAR1:	and of course what's particularly neat about this is that he's arguing back to a time that you could have never known about that . 162715_167815
*PAR1:	is when I had a &-um mother . 167815_169655
