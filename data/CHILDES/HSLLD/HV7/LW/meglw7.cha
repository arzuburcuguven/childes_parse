@Comment:	Chi writes independently and sort of fluently in that she produces a lot of text in a reasonably short amount of time , but mutters words as she writes them and doesn't use punctuation much. Mot mostly watches or talks with EXP , asks Chi to read back what she's done so far , and suggests a clarification to the text (have you written more versus did you write more) , which Chi does not adopt. When Chi moves on to the second page , MOT says that Chi is <a writer>.
*CHI:	no .
