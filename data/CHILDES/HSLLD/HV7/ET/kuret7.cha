@Comment:	MOT and Chi play well together pleasantly. The activity is almost entirely dedicated to building various structures , and there is very little discussion of the scientific properties of magnets , in fact there is very little discussion in general. Mot does test to see if a penny sticks , but that is the extent of experimentation
*MOT:	these things .
*MOT:	see these guys .
*MOT:	know what's doin(g) that .
*CHI:	lemme [: let me] try it .
*MOT:	oh that's how you do (th)em ?
*MOT:	(.) lift your hands up .
%com:	videotape starts here
%sit:	The big magnet , with the metal plate (a .k .a flat silver circle) affixed to the middle of it , is at the center of the table , directly in front of Chi . There are three of the silver men at the center of the big magnet , stacked standing on each others' shoulders making a tower three figures high . Other objects lie scattered around the table . Chi has some of the metal figures in his right hand .
%act:	MOT picks up the big magnet and lifts it up a bit , looking underneath
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	pauses to straighten the three magnetic balls into a line beside him on the table before reaching for the big magnet again
*MOT:	those ones [= silver men] are magnets too ?
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	puts a fourth silver man on top of the three already on the big magnet
*CHI:	yep .
%act:	reaches in the direction of the magnetic balls but stops short
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	affixes a fifth silver man onto the tower
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	detaches the yellow ball from the line of magnetic balls and places it on top of the tower
%sit:	the ball falls off and knocks the top two figures off the tower
*MOT:	whoa .
*INV:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	picks up several washers from the plastic tray
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	removes one of the fallen figures from the base of the big magnet
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	puts one washer down and it jumps onto the side of the big magnet
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	drags the second silver man across the black base away from the silver men still standing
*MOT:	wanna try and make a pyramid ?
*MOT:	<with them [= silver men]> [>] .
*CHI:	mhm [<] .
%act:	moves the silver man he's holding so that it is standing next to the bottom figure of the tower
*MOT:	with those [= silver men maybe] ?
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	takes the fifth silver man and places it next to the tower , on the opposite side from the previous silver man
%sit:	there is now a pyramid of men
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	picks up a magnetic ball from off the black base
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	tries to place the magnetic ball she's holding on top of a silver man on the black base
%sit:	the magnetic ball falls off
*MOT:	ah .
%act:	repeats previous action
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	takes a different magnetic ball off the big magnet
*MOT:	it [= magnetic ball] willn't stay up there .
%act:	puts the magnetic ball aside on the table and picks up a bolt
*CHI:	maybe you're putting it [= magnetic ball] upside down .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	puts the nut on top of a silver man
*CHI:	no those things [= magnetic balls] work .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	picks up a second nut and hands it to Chi
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	reaches to take the nut from Mot
%sit:	the nut falls out of Mot's hand and onto the black base
*MOT:	oops .
*MOT:	+^ sorry .
%sit:	aft when Chi picks up the nut , the tower of silver men tips to one side , nearly falling
*MOT:	oops .
*CHI:	no you're not comin(g) down .
%add:	tower
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	helps Chi straighten tower
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	put one [= nut] here .
%act:	picks up another nut and places it on the big magnet exactly opposite the nut Chi has just placed
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	successfully tries to place a pink paper clip in the middle of the tower of silver men .
*MOT:	can you get it [= paper clip] ?
%act:	picks up a penny from off the table
*MOT:	ah I don't think it's [= penny] gonna stick .
%act:	sees if the penny will stick to the middle of the tower of silver men , opposite where Chi has just placed the pink paper clip
*MOT:	uhuh .
%act:	puts penny back on table
*MOT:	it'll [= referent unclear] stay on if you touch it .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up a washer and carefully places on the base , touching one of the silver men
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	picks up a washer and places it on one of the middle figures of the tower
*MOT:	oh &=laughs .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up another washer
*MOT:	oh these [= green triangle magnet] can go on it too right ?
%act:	picks up a magnetic triangle and puts it on the base
*CHI:	here Mommy [?] .
%act:	affixes a washer to the middle of the construction
*MOT:	this way ?
%act:	lays the triangle down so that it is flat against the base
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up the yellow and white checked triangle magnet and tries unsuccessfully to stick it point up to the middle of the tower of figures
*MOT:	xxx looking for xxx .
%int:	under her breath
%act:	looks through the plastic tray full of objects
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	stops trying to affix the yellow checked triangle to the tower and puts it aside
*MOT:	oh there's two bars [= silver sticks] here .
*CHI:	cool .
%act:	reaches into the tray and picks up one of the silver sticks
*CHI:	what do we do with these [= silver sticks] ?
%act:	sticks the end of a silver stick to a nut on the black base
*MOT:	oh !
*MOT:	&=laughs .
%act:	touches the silver stick to one of the washers , which shifts in the direction of the silver stick but does not dislodge from the construction
*MOT:	it's [= silver sitck] stickin(g) on all the other ones [= nuts and silver men on black base] .
%act:	holds on to the washer with one hand and pushes the silver stick through the washer with the other; when she lets go of the stick , it flips over and sticks to the black base
*MOT:	oh it [= silver stick] willn't stay upright though .
*CHI:	not if I put it [= silver stick] like <right (.) there [= on a nut on the black base]> [>] .
*MOT:	<oh you know what> [<] ?
*CHI:	what ?
%sit:	aft the silver stick in Mot's hand touches one of the silver men and knocks it over
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	fixes the silver man
*CHI:	huh ?
*MOT:	I'm knockin(g) down everything .
*CHI:	the pyramid [= construction] .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	puts a nut onto the silver man that she'd knocked over
*MOT:	okay ?
*CHI:	one [= nut maybe] goes +...
*CHI:	wait .
*CHI:	(..) here [?] .
*CHI:	that one [= nut] doesn't go there [= on a silver man] .
%act:	reaches over either to straighten or remove the nut that Mot had put on top of the silver man
%sit:	as Chi works , his hand brushes the top of the tower , causing a washer to fall off onto the base , at which point one the yellow magnetic ball (which had been on the table) jumps over and attaches itself to the base as well
*CHI:	whoops [>] .
%act:	removes the fallen washer and the yellow ball from the base , putting the yellow ball aside
*MOT:	whoops [<] .
*MOT:	why doncha [: don't you] try this .
%act:	takes the other washer off the top of the tower , and places the silver stick horizontally on top of the head of the topmost silver man on the construction
*MOT:	and have something on there [=? it] ?
*CHI:	oh !
*CHI:	I have these (.) little balls [= yellow magnetic ball] .
%act:	attempts to stick the yellow magnet ball to one end of the silver stick
*MOT:	I don't think they'll [= magnet balls] stay up there [= on silver stick] but maybe we can do this .
%act:	picks up a washer and begins to slide it onto the opposite end of the silver stick
*CHI:	there [?] .
%act:	successfully sticks the magnet ball to the silver stick
*CHI:	like that .
%act:	picks up a red magnetic ball from off the tray
*MOT:	oh it [= yellow magnet ball] stayed .
*CHI:	yeah .
%act:	holds the red magnetic ball close to other end of the silver stick and waits for Mot to remove the washer
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	removes washer from silver stick
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	tries to stick the red magnetic ball to the silver stick
%sit:	the red ball falls off and lodges onto the base
*INV:	&=chuckles .
*MOT:	&=smiles .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up the red ball and tries unsuccessfully to stick it to the silver stick
*MOT:	I can't believe that's [= yellow magnet ball] stayin(g) up there [= on silver stick] .
*MOT:	try the other one [= magnet ball] buddy .
*MOT:	isn't there another ball ?
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	puts the red ball aside and picks up the maroon ball
*MOT:	maybe that one [= maroon magnet ball] would [>] work better .
*CHI:	xxx [<] .
%act:	tries to affix the maroon ball to the silver stick
*CHI:	of_course not .
%sit:	the ball falls off and lodges onto the black base
*CHI:	whoop(s) !
*CHI:	thought you were knockin(g) down everything else .
*CHI:	xxx .
*MOT:	can't believe that one's [= yellow magnet ball] staying up there .
*CHI:	that's (be)cause it's [= yellow magnet ball] on the side (.) a little .
*MOT:	here you go .
%act:	sucessfully gets maroon ball to stick to other end of silver stick on the construction
*CHI:	now I wanna see if we can fix this thing [= remainder of construction] .
%act:	attempts to replace a washer that had previously fallen; as he does this , the maroon ball falls
*MOT:	whoop(s) .
*CHI:	how dare he [= maroon ball maybe] fall .
*MOT:	&=vocalization .
*INV:	xxx .
*MOT:	I know .
*CHI:	let's just use these [= washers] .
*MOT:	these ones [= washers] ?
%act:	places a washer on the construction instead of the ball
*CHI:	nope [?] .
*CHI:	hey .
*CHI:	I'm gonna turn it to somethin(g) else .
*CHI:	let's take off these [= magnets on the black base] .
%act:	begins to clear objects off the black base
*CHI:	gonna make something else .
%act:	continues removing objects from the base
*CHI:	now it's xxx .
*CHI:	these [= nuts] off .
%com:	as he removes nuts , the main construction falls over
*CHI:	yeah xxx .
*MOT:	whoop(s) .
%act:	pulls off a nut that is stuck to the side of the black base
*CHI:	you lookin(g) at me ?
%add:	MOT
*MOT:	no .
*MOT:	just xxx .
*CHI:	okay .
%com:	black base is empty except for the silver circle
*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	if you take these [= silver men maybe] +...
%act:	places a silver man on the silver circle on the black base
*CHI:	that [= silver man] on that [= silver circle on black base] .
*CHI:	then stack one [= silver man] like on the same thing .
%act:	stacks a second silver man on top of the first
*CHI:	only [?] shoulder to shoulder .
*MOT:	maybe if you have two guys [= silver men] over here [= on opposite side of silver circle on black base] we can xxx that way .
*MOT:	then put the bar [= silver stick] across like that ?
%act:	holds silver stick in the air above the black base to demonstrate
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	stacks a third silver man on top of the other two already on base
*MOT:	like (.) on both of (th)em [= silver men] ?
*MOT:	&=coughs .
*CHI:	(.) (o)kay .
%act:	puts a fourth silver man on a different part of the silver circle
*CHI:	let's see .
%act:	sits back and looks at black base
*CHI:	&=vocalizations .
*CHI:	maybe the ball here [= referent unclear] .
%act:	picks up the yellow magnet ball from table and attempts to balance it on the silver man he has just placed on the black base
*CHI:	stay .
%add:	magnet ball
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	hm: .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	removes the magnet ball which was not staying; takes silver stick from Mot and places it on top of the third silver man in the stack of silver men on the base
*MOT:	make that [= purple star magnet] stay up there [= on top of silver stick] .
%act:	attempts to balance the star magnet on top of the construction; the magnet falls
*CHI:	whoa [>] !
*MOT:	&=laughs [<] .
*MOT:	no .
%act:	takes star magnet away
*CHI:	xxx .
*CHI:	let's see .
%act:	puts a fifth silver man on the black base across from the fourth man and then places a silver stick across the two men
*MOT:	hm: ?
*CHI:	your turn .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	places a washer on the silver stick that is at the top of the construction
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	whoops .
%act:	tries to place a magnet ball on top of the washer she has just placed; it falls
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	stay up there [= top of construction] .
%add:	magnet ball
*MOT:	no .
%act:	takes magnet ball away and adds another washer instead
*MOT:	(.) you can leave that [= referent unclear] like that Chi .
*CHI:	cool xxx .
*CHI:	xxx .
*MOT:	what thing ?
*CHI:	thing [= referent unclear] .
*MOT:	it [= magnet ball maybe] rolled down here [= bottom of black base] .
*CHI:	xxx where ?
