*PAR0:	I'm sure you've been asked these before . 105020_106420
*PAR0:	&-um but &-um so my first question would be have you have there been any changes since like the last visit or so last since like maybe the first or the second visit in terms of maybe what toys he likes to play with or what games he likes to play with . 107220_121560
*PAR0:	&-um he's definitely expanded &-uh not from the second to the third visit because it was last week . 121560_125960
*PAR0:	but from his first to second visit he plays with a lot more toys now and a lot more actively with toys . 125960_131900
*PAR0:	&-um he used to play with just like rattles and stuff . 132600_135880
*PAR0:	and now he's into like blocks and [/] and everything . 135880_141560
*PAR0:	go get it . 141560_153520
*PAR0:	he he's a lot more active now than he was at seven or eight months . 153520_161340
*PAR0:	yeah he's a lot more mobile . 161340_163540
*PAR0:	okay . 163540_165120
*PAR0:	so which toys . 165120_166940
*PAR0:	do you think he was the most interested in this visit . 166940_170600
*PAR0:	this m- visit was probably this book . 170600_172720
*PAR0:	&-um and the little Bumblebee . 172720_174700
*PAR0:	he's traditionally like the Bumblebee thank you . 174820_176980
*PAR0:	thank you . 177260_178000
*PAR0:	although he does like &-um he played with the food toys not necessarily because they were food toys because he likes blocks a lot . 178400_184040
*PAR0:	so I think it was things he could throw around pretty easily . 184100_186740
*PAR0:	he likes to do that . 186860_187580
*PAR0:	okay . 188080_188460
*PAR0:	yeah . 189260_190300
*PAR0:	does he like animals a lot . 191120_194920
*PAR0:	no I mean we've had this book at home . 194920_197300
*PAR0:	and he doesn't care for it . 197300_198200
*PAR0:	so [/] so first it's a pretty similar book . 198200_200960
*PAR0:	and so that that's new . 200960_202980
*PAR0:	does he like ducks . 202980_205460
*PAR0:	nope . 205460_206260
*PAR0:	okay . 206260_208680
*PAR0:	I think he likes the texture of that bumblebee stuff toy he always has since he started coming . 208680_212740
*PAR0:	but nope that's the first time he's really played with that . 212740_216180
*PAR0:	my husband tries to read it to him like every night this and other books . 216840_219660
*PAR0:	and he could care less which ones do you think interested him the least in terms of the toys that were here at this visit . 219720_227000
*PAR0:	&-um still not interested like doll babies or anything like that . 227280_230500
*PAR0:	&-um and then he's not really interested in stuffed toys too much anymore . 230520_236200
*PAR0:	okay . 236760_237220
*PAR0:	why do you think that might be . 238440_241220
*PAR0:	he's not really interesting in I don't think they're &-um like when he throws or moves a block around it makes a noise . 241220_249180
*PAR0:	and it when he moves a stuffed toy around it usually doesn't squeak or make noise . 249180_253640
*PAR0:	and he's interested in things that like can bang together and [/] and make noise or like when we're home we often stack . 253640_259580
*PAR0:	and he knocks it down . 259580_260420
*PAR0:	stuffed toys aren't as noisy or interactive . 260420_264320
*PAR0:	yeah . 264320_264800
*PAR0:	okay . 264800_265500
*PAR0:	and he doesn't really have like a security blanket or anything yet . 265500_270280
*PAR0:	so you're . 270280_271660
*PAR0:	something he's particularly attached to and out of the books . 271660_275760
*PAR0:	which book would you prefer that he would look at with you . 275760_278680
*PAR0:	&-um I mean this one's cool because it's got the textures . 279740_282420
*PAR0:	and the no I didn't re actually read it to him . 282420_284480
*PAR0:	but it's &-um the ones that we have at home . 284480_287780
*PAR0:	he re we read to him . 287780_288880
*PAR0:	and he's bored . 288880_289560
*PAR0:	so we all but we always tell him a dog . 289980_291480
*PAR0:	you know the doggy and the kitty . 291580_292760

*PAR0:	so <these are> [/] these are hits . 295220_296740
*PAR0:	usually . 296740_297120
*PAR0:	okay . 297560_297860
*PAR0:	and do you think there are any items that you think your that your child recognizes the name of . 298280_303500

*PAR0:	do you think &-um there are any items that he's never seen or heard of before . 315680_319620
*PAR0:	&-um I mean the a lot of the food items are very block like . 319640_325160
*PAR0:	but he probably hasn't seen like . 325740_328280
*PAR0:	I don't think I've ever said to him . 328280_329240
*PAR0:	spaghetti . 329240_329580
*PAR0:	but yeah he's eaten spaghetti . 329580_331160
*PAR0:	he just wouldn't know what that was . 331160_332960

*PAR0:	&-um he's had stuffed toys and &-um and other stuff . 338340_341540

*PAR0:	and do you think he prefers books or toys [/] toys . 354320_357920
*PAR0:	I mean when he plays with books it's because it's toy like it's not like he's reading it . 358660_363600
*PAR0:	it's he can you know especially the small ones . 363600_366380
*PAR0:	he kind of just opens it and goes back and forth because it so something to play with . 366380_370120
*PAR0:	not because it's got words in it . 370120_372480
