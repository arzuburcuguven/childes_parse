*PAR0:	yeah she did &-um let's see . 94160_100680
*PAR0:	so which of the toy toys &-um interested her or your the most you said the baby and the food I think and the food . 100680_110540
*PAR0:	okay . 110540_110880
*PAR0:	&-um I mean because she's like now eating more like solid foods and table foods . 110880_117080
*PAR0:	&-uh so I think she's more interested in picking things up and trying it . 117080_121400
*PAR0:	and &-um do you think she recognized she eats &-um like a lot of like biscuits and . 121400_127480
*PAR0:	stuff . 127480_127980
*PAR0:	and &-um I guess she thought it was real . 128320_131460
*PAR0:	so I was gonna ask you do you think she recognized any of the food objects as [/] as something similar to looking like the [/] the real items that she might have had at home . 131860_141200
*PAR0:	yeah maybe the peas . 141200_142220
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 142220_142880
*PAR0:	and it's been a long time . 142880_147260
*PAR0:	and &-uh one day I &-uh I got her myself ice . 147260_150620
*PAR0:	cream . 150620_150840
*PAR0:	and I showed it to her because I don't know if she recognizes that bread . 150840_155420
*PAR0:	probably . 155420_158040
*PAR0:	&-um I mean she's never had this kind of cookie but probably something similar . 158040_163920
*PAR0:	&-um yeah the pizza . 163920_168020
*PAR0:	&-uh huh probably because &-um my [/] my parents make pizza . 168020_172320
*PAR0:	we make pizza . 172320_172840
*PAR0:	and we whenever I go over we have the crust of the pizza . 172840_175960
*PAR0:	I give her the crust . 177120_178260
*PAR0:	and I chew on she likes to play with my keys . 178440_182960
*PAR0:	&-uh huh I thought she'd be interested in the Pika Baby book because we have a book very similar to that at home . 183860_191320
*PAR0:	but she and the ones with like the animals and the feeling of the animals and stuff . 192520_197080
*PAR0:	oh &-uh huh we have the good night moon but not the one that counts . 197540_200660
*PAR0:	but &-uh guess she was more interested in the things that she could just that makes noise or that could fee have a certain feeling or that she could put in her mouth . 201160_212020
*PAR0:	more . 212020_212420

*PAR0:	&-um today as opposed to last time or did she pretty much eat more of them . 216840_223720
*PAR0:	&-um I think the one she liked last time was the Peega baby . 223820_227460

*PAR0:	this one . 229940_230340

*PAR0:	I don't know if they were here . 233560_235640

*PAR0:	but &-um she was a little interested &-um but <not too much> [/] not too much . 262320_266920
*PAR0:	okay . 267420_267900
*PAR0:	and you said she has a baby doll at home . 268140_269820
*PAR0:	yeah . 270120_270440
*PAR0:	and does she &-um play with it or try to feed it or any of that kind of stuff yet . 270740_275920
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know . 276280_277820
*PAR0:	&-um I guess with my schedule and stuff we don't play too much with the toys at home . 278640_285900
*PAR0:	she's plays at my grandma my mom's house . 286040_289460
*PAR0:	&-um or she plays downstairs . 289460_293240
*PAR0:	and she usually has a caregiver then . 293240_295820
*PAR0:	but we the I usually read her a lot of books huh . 295820_299860
*PAR0:	and &-um we have meal times all together . 300100_304700
*PAR0:	and do you read at meal times . 304700_307020
*PAR0:	&-um not too often . 307020_309020
*PAR0:	okay . 309280_309480
*PAR0:	but &-uh &-um and do you have any of the pretend food or dishes and stuff like that at home . 309740_318220
*PAR0:	no . 318720_319480
*PAR0:	okay . 319800_320120
*PAR0:	and &-um if you're reading a book with her either today or at home do you think she prefers to have it read . 321260_330840
*PAR0:	to her or does she like to sort of read it herself . 330840_333960
*PAR0:	she usually takes the book from me . 334460_336280
*PAR0:	and she'll try to open and close the book or tries to skip to the pages . 336280_343880
*PAR0:	skip to the pages or something . 343880_345860
*PAR0:	and [/] and then I'll open up another book to try to read or . 345860_349460
*PAR0:	and she'll just she just wants to play with the different books . 349460_353780
*PAR0:	and just &-uh huh because we'll have a few in front of us . 353780_357440
*PAR0:	and she'll just toss one to the side and look at the next one . 357440_360760
*PAR0:	you really think there's something that's come out there to get something out of that . 361320_366880
*PAR0:	she's not mad though . 366880_371580

*PAR0:	which toy I know we asked you this one last time . 374220_377540
*PAR0:	but which of these toys here do you think are the best for her personality . 377540_381320
*PAR0:	&-um &-um probably the [/] the doll she likes play . 381320_394960
*PAR0:	you know it's she likes babies and to play with others . 395260_399100
*PAR0:	and &-um animals . 399400_402100

*PAR0:	I don't know I mean she just likes a lot of interaction and stuff . 408040_412380
*PAR0:	okay . 412380_412760

*PAR0:	&-um but I think that might be all . 427080_430160
*PAR0:	yeah . 430160_431640
*PAR0:	but in when she plays all alone it's more exploration kind of thing . 432340_436460
*PAR0:	it's not really like sitting down and playing with right for a long time . 436580_441360
*PAR0:	right getting into things she shouldn't . 441680_443820
*PAR0:	okay . 444360_445300
*PAR0:	&-um is there anything else . 446720_448180
*PAR0:	that's all the questions I have . 448340_449480
*PAR0:	but is there anything else that I didn't . 449520_450700
*PAR0:	ask you that you feel like would be good to know about how she's playing now or the kinds of things that she is into . 450700_457580
