*INV:	we have all these goodies that we brought at a previous visit &-um for you <guys to play> [>] with .
@Comment:	Time is 16:15
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play well together , though Chi clearly dominates the play. He decides what they will do , and takes pieces from Mot without asking for them. EXP stays in the background , laughing and commenting only in a few instances. There is no serious discussion about the properties of magnets. Mot and Chi , for the most part , spend the time trying to see how many objects the black base or the yellow wand will hold. In one instance where discussion could have easily come into play , when a penny fails to stick to one of the magnets and the Chi says it's not metal , the only explanation given by Mot is that it's a coin. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
