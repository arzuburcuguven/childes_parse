*PAR0:	so we [/] we play with the animals . 314160_316640
*PAR0:	but I don't think these are as much fun to her as the figures of the animals because these didn't really do anything . 316640_323140

*PAR0:	she's very engaged . 339340_340220
*PAR0:	and it's kinda late and I know so . 340220_343680
*PAR0:	alright . 343800_344620
*PAR0:	so can I kind of excuse sorry . 344700_348980
*PAR0:	not a problem . 348980_350220
*PAR0:	&-um just kind of explain the last two consent forms we have . 350220_353960
*PAR0:	okay . 353960_354680
*PAR0:	&-um I'll get you &-uh so you can kind of hook up on and sign them . 354680_361260
*PAR0:	&-um this first one just kind of explains that while we were looking at her language we're also kind of looking at yours . 361260_369320
*PAR0:	so &-um we re we [/] we have recorded your speech . 369480_372580
*PAR0:	mhm . 372900_373160
*PAR0:	and so this form is about &-um agreeing to allow us to analyze it . 373660_377720
*PAR0:	kind of looking at your speaking rate . 377800_379160
*PAR0:	&-uh variety of words . 379380_380280
*PAR0:	you use . 380280_380720
*PAR0:	mhm . 380880_381060
*PAR0:	of sentences . 381060_381520
*PAR0:	&-um how carefully you pronounce new words . 382280_384060
*PAR0:	okay . 384360_384620
*PAR0:	so this form is just kind of on the back . 384620_388660
*PAR0:	&-um just sign and give us permission to analyze your speech . 388660_392800
*PAR0:	okay . 393020_393220
*PAR0:	&-um and then the second form is it's about &-um an international database of children and parents language . 393680_402140
*PAR0:	mm so &-um there's one that kind of exists already . 402440_405280
*PAR0:	but it's a little outdated . 405280_406180
*PAR0:	it's kind of old . 406380_407000
*PAR0:	&-um and so we're trying to get an updated version of it . 407360_410760
*PAR0:	okay . 411040_411360
*PAR0:	&-um and this part is entire about entirely voluntary . 411620_414260
*PAR0:	&-um but it kind of comes in three different varieties . 414820_418520
*PAR0:	so the first one &-um you are these three . 418740_422420
*PAR0:	mm . 422420_422500
*PAR0:	so the first one is I do not want any of my data or my child's data to be made available to other language researchers . 422500_428660
*PAR0:	okay . 428920_429040
*PAR0:	so it would just be available to us here at Maryland okay . 429040_431640
*PAR0:	&-um this database is kind of available to other research universities . 431640_435260
*PAR0:	mhm &-um the next option is you'd allow anonymous transcripts and test score data be to be made available . 435820_442520
*PAR0:	mhm so that would be if we listen to it here we transcribe it what we're looking for . 442520_448600
*PAR0:	and then upload that data . 448600_450840
*PAR0:	gotcha . 450840_451700
*PAR0:	the most permissive one is the third one which is allowing anonymous audio recordings made accessible . 451700_457480
*PAR0:	mhm the benefit [/] benefit of [/] of that is &-uh researcher in the future could look back and kinda listen to it . 457480_462900
*PAR0:	and our transcription might not have what they were looking for . 462900_467000
*PAR0:	but if they can listen to the audio right so that can help them out a lot . 467000_469880
*PAR0:	okay . 470060_470260
*PAR0:	&-um it would remove all your identifying . 470400_472000
*PAR0:	information . 472000_472500
*PAR0:	so when you say her name or your her sister's name you know all that would be at . 472680_476980
*PAR0:	oh okay . 477000_477340
*PAR0:	so &-um so just feel free to pick any of those three . 477540_481260
*PAR0:	&-um and just sign it and date it . 481260_483080
*PAR0:	so . 483080_483360
*PAR0:	okay . 483360_483800
*PAR0:	and there you go . 484080_485260
*PAR0:	I'm just gonna go . 485520_486200
*PAR0:	we're done . 487000_487440
*PAR0:	and then we also have a &-um a toy she can take home . 489340_493300
*PAR0:	okay . 493400_493700
*PAR0:	I I'll let you decide if you want to pick the toy or if you want her to pick the toy . 537800_575600
*PAR0:	oh I'm gonna let her pick the toy . 575600_577340
*PAR0:	okay . 577340_577740
*PAR0:	part of the fun . 577740_578680
*PAR0:	I think there's some books . 578680_579780
*PAR0:	there's also tee shirts if you prefer that . 579780_581440
*PAR0:	but whatever she likes . 581440_584420
*PAR0:	and there's those two . 584460_585440
*PAR0:	okay . 585740_586000
*PAR0:	great . 586000_586280
*PAR0:	thank you . 586360_586800
*PAR0:	okay . 587120_587860
*PAR0:	&-um and &-uh last thing would you be interested in hearing about other studies here . 588120_593020
*PAR0:	yeah oh yeah always . 593020_593980
*PAR0:	yeah . 593980_594600
*PAR0:	so we'll &-um we'll keep you on our list and call you when . 594600_598400
*PAR0:	yeah . 598400_598540
*PAR0:	definitely another study comes up . 598540_600040
*PAR0:	go into the restroom before I go get her &-um restroom is you can go down this way . 600040_604960
*PAR0:	okay . 604960_605440
*PAR0:	&-um and we'll get &-um yeah we'll go left . 605440_608160
