@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	yeah .
@Comment:	FAT and Chi do not collaborate with each other while playing , but they are kind to each other and do assist the other player in his or her individual projects. Fat takes a while to warm to the activity and become an active participant. Chi does most of the talking. EXP is not central to the activity or conversation , but she is obviously present. Chi experiments with the magnets and notices that the metal objects only stick together when they are on the black base. Fat describes the basic concept behind magnets: that like forces repel , and unlike forces attract , and Fat demonstrates this for Chi. Audio tape could not be located; transcription and verification are from the video tape. Chi sits at a table with the magnets in front of her; Fat is not visible on the video; there are several objects piled on the black base and Chi holds the yellow wand over the base
*INV:	so you can do whatever you'd like with it [= magnets] and say whatever you want .
*CHI:	it [/] it [= yellow wand] just willn't pick up .
%sit:	Chi uses the yellow wand in an attempt to remove objects from the black base
*CHI:	I'll make this [= nut] move and it [= nut] wants to go down [= onto the base] .
*CHI:	cmon .
%add:	an object on the black base which Chi is trying to remove using the wand
*FAT:	0 .
%act:	reaches hesitantly for the yellow wand and tries to remove an object from the base
*INV:	there's other things in here [= clear plastic box] if you wanna xxx those [= objects in the box] .
*INV:	little guys [= silver men] .
*CHI:	xxx .
%act:	opens the clear plastic box
*CHI:	xxx .
%act:	removes two thin magnets , a square and a circle , from the plastic box and sets them on the table
*CHI:	probably will pick up that [= thin magnets] .
*FAT:	0 .
%act:	picks up the round thin magnet and places it closer to him; he tries to pick it up with the wand , but the circle is repelled
*CHI:	well they're [= washers] sure attractive .
%sit:	while Chi removed other objects from the plastic box , a few washers fell next to the base and then quickly attached to it
*CHI:	(..) that's cool .
%act:	Chi stacks washers on top of one another on their side .
*INV:	(..) oh my .
%sit:	FAT made the tower of washers fall by touching it with the yellow wand and then straigtened it out again by lifting the tower with the wand
*CHI:	oh &~w we had a accident [?] .
%sit:	the tower of washers fell when Fat pulled the wand away from the washers
*CHI:	daddy keep (th)em [= washers] up .
*CHI:	keep (th)em up .
%act:	holds washers in tower formation; wants Fat to use the wand to keep the tower standing
*CHI:	ugh .
%sit:	the tower fell slightly
*CHI:	up .

*CHI:	two .
%act:	places a second washer on top of the first
*CHI:	whoa .
%sit:	the two-washer tower falls
*FAT:	there's some of like forces there so maybe <they don't> [/] they don't attract .
%sit:	as Fat holds the wand over the tower of washers , the tower moves back and forth , away from the wand
*CHI:	thank you .
%sit:	using the wand , FAT straightened the tower
*FAT:	see the force that can move this one [= thin circle magnet] around .
%sit:	holds the wand over the circle and tries to make it move without touching it with the wand; the circle doesn't move
*CHI:	it [= wand] can move this one [= red ball] too .
*CHI:	we have an act here .
%act:	moves to place a silver stick in the hands of a silver man which stands atop the tower of washers
*INV:	we have a what here ?
*CHI:	an act .

%act:	looks for something in her hands and finds it
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	(.) daddy daddy we need some attracting here .
%sit:	Chi holds the tower of washers steady and calls for Fat to use the wand to steady the tower instead
*CHI:	oh !
*CHI:	no !
%sit:	Chi moved the wand above the tower so that the wand was no longer touching it; the tower falls
*CHI:	you're sposta stay up .
*CHI:	not down .
%add:	tower
*CHI:	ow .
%sit:	pulls washers off with some difficulty while holding the silver stick
%com:	Chi may have poked herself with the silver stick while she was pulling off the washers
*CHI:	wait .
*CHI:	I'll take the stick off .
%act:	removes stick from the base .
*CHI:	start all over again .
*CHI:	one .
%act:	positions a washer on its side on the base .

%act:	adds another washer to the stack
*CHI:	0 .
%sit:	FAT holds the yellow wand steadily over the stack of washers; Chi places a silver man on top of the stack and the silver man , attracted to the yellow wand , jumps from the stack of washers to the wand
*CHI:	0 [=! sound of surprise] .
*CHI:	xxx .
%sit:	Chi adds another washer to the stack while Fat tries to reattach the silver man to the stack
*CHI:	daddy put him [= silver man] up front right here [= on top of the washer tower] .
%act:	takes the silver man from Fat and places it where Chi wants
*CHI:	&=vocalization .
*CHI:	hm: .
%sit:	several pieces at the top of the tower fall
*CHI:	okay .
%int:	whispered
%sit:	Chi re-attaches a washer to the tower as Fat holds the wand above the tower; the newly attached washer is repelled by the wand and falls from the top position to attach to the side of the tower
*CHI:	ugh .
%sit:	the tower falls as Chi tries to reposition the top washer and straighten the tower
*CHI:	come on xxx .
%add:	the tower
%act:	works on remaking the tower

*CHI:	that will keep (th)em [= maybe parts of the tower] together +...
*CHI:	+, like that .
%act:	sets up another washer near the base of the tower , apparently hoping to keep the tower steady
*CHI:	I can keep it [= tower standing] like that [= with a washer leaned against the base] .
*CHI:	oh !
%sit:	the tower falls
*CHI:	&=laughs [>] .
*INV:	&=laughs [<] [>] .
