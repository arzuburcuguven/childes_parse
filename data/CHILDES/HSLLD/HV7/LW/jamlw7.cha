@Comment:	MOT and Chi sit at a table for the letter writing activity , while Fat sits on the couch but keeps involved in the process. After Chi looks through the book , FAT and Mot give suggestions to Chi on how to begin the letter as well on the content. Mot dictates much of the letter , and writes Chi's address on the back. Fat is surprised that Chi can spell sincerely (Chi actually misspelled it in the letter). He asks if it's a third grade word.
