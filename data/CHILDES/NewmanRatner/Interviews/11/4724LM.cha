*PAR0:	I was kind of hoping for Sangria that's better teach like that . 0_4620
*PAR0:	I know . 4620_4860
*PAR0:	know you have friends who unfortunately have taught their children things like that . 4860_9720
*PAR0:	and it's both precocious and disturbing . 9720_12300
*PAR0:	yeah exactly . 12300_13900
*PAR0:	yes . 13900_14760
*PAR0:	&-um alright . 14760_16100
*PAR0:	well he was here not too long ago . 16100_18560
*PAR0:	have you noticed any differences . 18560_20260
*PAR0:	&-um in the way he's playing or what he likes to play with . 20260_23860
*PAR0:	he is playing with books now at home . 23860_25860
*PAR0:	so he's opening books and closing books and pow . 25860_30560
*PAR0:	and he can reach a lot more now . 30560_33380
*PAR0:	so he's playing with things that are up higher . 33380_36000
*PAR0:	he's climbing up onto things to get to other things which is a little scary because he has no concept of you know gravity danger any of those good things . 36000_47620
*PAR0:	&-um still really likes plastic stuff definitely to chew on still getting teeth . 47620_53240
*PAR0:	I mean he's got five teeth now all of a sudden . 53240_55440
*PAR0:	so . 55440_56720
*PAR0:	yeah . 56720_57300
*PAR0:	&-um but and at home he won't really play with the stuffed animals at all . 57300_63440
*PAR0:	this is the first you know time here that he's really played with any of them . 63440_67880
*PAR0:	oh okay . 67880_68920
*PAR0:	&-um but at home it's still not really his thing . 68920_72120
*PAR0:	mm . 72120_72620
*PAR0:	hmm . 72620_73140
*PAR0:	but there's too many people to play with at home you know right . 73140_77620
*PAR0:	so he does like the books now though he does some like . 77620_81200
*PAR0:	well I'll see him do it by himself where he'll go and pick up a book and play with a book which is new for him . 81200_86640
*PAR0:	okay . 86800_87020
*PAR0:	&-um and plastic things you said still really loves those and trucks and balls . 87680_93200
*PAR0:	we have a ton of balls at our house . 93420_95440
*PAR0:	and the dog plays fetch . 95720_96760
*PAR0:	and he plays fetch with the dog now by himself which is . 96940_99060
*PAR0:	really cute . 99060_99580
*PAR0:	so I'll find the two of them off playing fetch . 99580_102380
*PAR0:	so if we had a ball here you'd probably play with it . 102840_105260
*PAR0:	mm yeah . 105480_106440
*PAR0:	especially if you had a ball and a dog are you painting like you knew are you silly . 106440_112960
*PAR0:	when you hear you say dog . 113280_115100
*PAR0:	is that why you think he's doing that or I don't know that's not really [/] really the sign that we do for dog . 115100_120960
*PAR0:	so but he'll say ball for both dog and the ball . 120960_124040
*PAR0:	so he'll say something that sounds suspiciously like ball . 124040_126980
*PAR0:	I he's approximating words now which is pretty cool . 126980_129620
*PAR0:	he doesn't have I mean &-uh oh is the one that's really distinct . 129620_132520
*PAR0:	but he says something that sounds a lot like more when he's . 132520_137200
*PAR0:	and he only says it when he's sitting in the high chair . 137200_138960
*PAR0:	and he wants more food . 138960_139700
*PAR0:	so it's very situation specific . 139760_142860
*PAR0:	&-um and taken as more . 143560_145920
*PAR0:	so . 146280_146780
*PAR0:	and then when you give him more he stops saying it . 146780_149460
*PAR0:	so I mean him self understood . 149680_150960
*PAR0:	oh yeah definitely . 151180_152220
*PAR0:	and do you think he likes the plastic things . 152900_155080
*PAR0:	&-um because you said he's putting them in his mouth . 155080_158640
*PAR0:	you think that's why he likes those or other . 158900_161280
*PAR0:	I it seems like that's what he's always done . 161420_163520
*PAR0:	like he's always put plastic stuff in his mouth . 163700_165680
*PAR0:	and he think he likes the texture . 165960_167760

*PAR0:	he yeah he just seems to go for that stuff . 173600_175120
*PAR0:	I think he likes the noise it makes . 175140_176400
*PAR0:	I mean I just think he likes the whole everything about plastic . 176580_179520

*PAR0:	attention to that . 286560_287260
*PAR0:	and he the little fuzzy things on the inside . 287360_289700
*PAR0:	and yeah I was hearing &-uh some animal sounds and animal names was that when you were doing books or &-um that bits the book because it was all the farm critters . 289700_301480
*PAR0:	so and does he have favorite animals . 302000_304700

*PAR0:	and he paid attention when I was singing the song . 315100_316880
*PAR0:	so I don't know why you listen to me sing boy except the fact that you have to . 316880_321920
*PAR0:	but yeah baa . 321920_326300
