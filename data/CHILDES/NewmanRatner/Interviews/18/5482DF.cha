*PAR0:	and like the stroller he likes pushing the little doll strollers around . 384760_389040
*PAR0:	but then he like runs up in the wall and makes noise . 389040_391520
*PAR0:	yeah . 391520_392940
*PAR0:	ooh is that good . 392940_396240
*PAR0:	mhm so with the bottle and the cup do you think he recognized it as real money definitely because he was you know trying to drink out of them . 396240_405380
*PAR0:	and then he knew what to do . 405940_409020
*PAR0:	like feed it to the baby or the stuffed . 409020_410640
*PAR0:	animal you're eating out of that . 410640_413060

*PAR0:	yeah especially certain ones . 442360_445180
*PAR0:	I'm not sure . 445180_445600
*PAR0:	maybe everything . 445600_446260
*PAR0:	he's definitely got eyes nose mouth hair and toes the ears and belly aren't as strong . 446260_452320
*PAR0:	I'd say . 452320_453960
*PAR0:	you feed the the baby . 453960_461260
*PAR0:	you're gonna share your sisters don't share . 461260_463500
*PAR0:	huh we do that . 463500_472420
*PAR0:	&-um we do like a you know like you bounce on the knees . 472420_477500
*PAR0:	do the cha [/] cha de Bossa Nova you've seen that . 477500_479780
*PAR0:	&-um I'm trying to think I don't think there's any other way right . 479780_487600
*PAR0:	I know right . 487600_488300
*PAR0:	like you should see him and go seek . 488300_503440
*PAR0:	and he sort of will get into that a little like he'll hide but you know they didn't even get the rules of hide and go seek . 503600_508860
*PAR0:	but &-um so he does sorta get that . 508860_518180
*PAR0:	so compared to last time I forgot to ask this . 518180_520800
*PAR0:	usually one of the first questions has his choice of toys changed . 520800_525420
*PAR0:	like what did he like . 525420_526620
*PAR0:	last time I remember him being into the books and thinking I should read to him more . 526620_533100
*PAR0:	so that stayed the same . 533100_535000
*PAR0:	and ithink . 535000_535640
*PAR0:	he was into the stuffed animals last time more . 535640_537620
*PAR0:	but I was directing more of the play at that age you know because he wasn't as like into stuff . 538000_545660
*PAR0:	so I think I was directing more of the stuffed animal stuff . 545780_548100
*PAR0:	and I think he's not . 549180_552020
*PAR0:	choosing that so much as a his choice . 552020_556420
*PAR0:	you're ready to go . 556420_557660
*PAR0:	he's like . 557660_558240
*PAR0:	all right . 558240_558560
*PAR0:	this is what we need . 558560_560240
*PAR0:	I think that's it . 560240_561460
*PAR0:	ok , but I think . 561460_562440
*PAR0:	good timing . 562440_563540
*PAR0:	I know right . 563540_564720
*PAR0:	good job . 564720_565600
