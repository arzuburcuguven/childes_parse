*PAR0:	pizza . 188900_189200
*PAR0:	why do you think that [/] that is attractive to her . 189300_191460
*PAR0:	I think it's a lot brighter than the others . 191660_193360
*PAR0:	mhm some parents will say . 193520_199160

*PAR0:	yeah the right size you know some of . 208260_209840
*PAR0:	the other things are big . 209840_211240
*PAR0:	yeah I know she likes &-um bright things . 211240_213960
*PAR0:	and the pizza fits right in . 213960_215900
*PAR0:	yeah it's very bright to it . 216260_217280
*PAR0:	I mean &-um like the &-uh like . 217380_220040
*PAR0:	yeah see this piece of cheese . 220040_221340
*PAR0:	she's going that's big and clumsy . 221540_222780
*PAR0:	but she's going for it but it's bright . 222780_224520
*PAR0:	I think that's the reason . 224700_225500
*PAR0:	and maybe that's the reasons sh for the . 225900_227800
*PAR0:	yeah plenty of the food and such . 227800_230980
*PAR0:	look at that . 231040_231460

*PAR0:	another yellow thing . 234480_235640
*PAR0:	mhm . 236260_236580
*PAR0:	mhm . 236800_236940
*PAR0:	did she like any of the books . 237160_239040
*PAR0:	I think you were reading something not really . 239140_241280
*PAR0:	and we used to read to her at least &-um a few times a week . 241660_245020
*PAR0:	but on [/] on the books we have the words are really big . 245240_248360
*PAR0:	okay . 248860_249060
*PAR0:	and the pictures are like really big [/] big . 249180_251140
*PAR0:	so I don't know she looked at it . 251140_252880
*PAR0:	and she was like . 252880_253260
*PAR0:	I don't want to buy it . 253260_254280
*PAR0:	I don't know because it's small . 254280_255700
*PAR0:	yeah . 255700_256180
*PAR0:	yeah . 256180_256900
*PAR0:	&-um we also do your baby can read the words are really big . 256900_261620
*PAR0:	I don't know if that's it or if there's just a lot of distraction . 261720_264560
*PAR0:	and that's probably it's probably more distraction than anything . 264840_267300
*PAR0:	because usually when we read it's just a book nothing [/] nothing else [/] else for her to . 267560_270640
*PAR0:	mm . 271000_271300
*PAR0:	hmm mm hmm . 271300_272520
*PAR0:	let's see what else . 272720_273460
*PAR0:	I oh do you think there are any other items that she would she knows or she would be familiar with the name of . 273460_280400
*PAR0:	even if she doesn't recognize the item I don't think so . 280640_284760
*PAR0:	okay . 284860_285140
*PAR0:	and does she eat any . 285740_286640
*PAR0:	of these foods . 286640_287340
*PAR0:	she's pretty little maybe peas but it's all purees . 287740_292800
*PAR0:	I don't think she'll recognize it even but she might well maybe if she eats them she might &-um she's said that word a lot . 292800_304180
*PAR0:	I don't know . 304180_304740
*PAR0:	yeah . 304740_305620
*PAR0:	but she's not getting anything like ice cream huh . 305620_309000
*PAR0:	no . 309000_309700
*PAR0:	okay . 309700_310180
*PAR0:	no . 310180_310940
*PAR0:	&-um and then of these things what do you think she was interested in . 310940_314080
*PAR0:	the least today . 314080_315380
*PAR0:	&-um I she could have cared less about the zebra . 315380_319400
*PAR0:	I know . 319900_320220
*PAR0:	and maybe that's the least bright color available . 320540_325000
*PAR0:	gets used to like this [/] this because [/] because of they the yeah but it gets gummy . 325240_328580
*PAR0:	oh I didn't really show her that one too much . 329140_331380
*PAR0:	let's see . 332080_332540
*PAR0:	&-um do you does she like &-um books or toys better at home . 332540_339620
*PAR0:	&-um see there's usually separate when we do read books to her . 340240_349400
*PAR0:	it's just books . 349400_351500
*PAR0:	so she pays close attention to the books . 351500_354020
*PAR0:	yeah . 354020_354820
*PAR0:	and but I you know maybe toys because a toy we could just have sitting around . 354820_358260
*PAR0:	and then she'll show interest in it a book once we pick it up she shows interest . 358260_364300
*PAR0:	there's no other right . 364380_366120
*PAR0:	so maybe toys and then toys are brighter . 366340_368740
*PAR0:	anyway they are you know book is so would you say that for her personality <or the> [/] or the stage that she's at now that the bright toys are the things that would really be the best for her because she likes them . 368740_380540
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah I think she has a preference for bright colors . 380640_384120
*PAR0:	and you said you don't have dolls at home . 384820_390420
*PAR0:	and you don't have the pretend food . 390420_392040
*PAR0:	so these are new things for her . 392180_393920
*PAR0:	mhm . 394080_394360
*PAR0:	okay . 394560_394840
*PAR0:	is there anything else . 394840_396180
*PAR0:	that's all my questions . 396280_397180
*PAR0:	&-um were there anything else that you thought we should know about what she likes play with or how she likes to play that we didn't . 397760_407220
*PAR0:	&-um well right now majority you know she just likes to put things in her mouth . 407220_411560
*PAR0:	yeah that's and that's how she plays at home . 411560_414140
*PAR0:	whatever it is . 414140_414760
*PAR0:	she's interested in it . 414760_415760
*PAR0:	just goes straight to the mouth . 415760_416820
*PAR0:	yeah that's it . 416820_418280
*PAR0:	she doesn't [/] doesn't like [/] like do [/] do anything [/] anything with [/] with them [/] them yet [/] yet . 418280_421060
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 421060_421340
*PAR0:	she well doesn't bang them or anything like . 421340_422620
*PAR0:	no . 422620_422960
*PAR0:	well she she'd actually sometimes she does bang on one . 422960_427000
*PAR0:	you know sometimes she'll shake them and if the table is close enough . 427000_430340
*PAR0:	but she ends up banging it . 430340_431860
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah I'm so with things like that they'll shake them because they make a noise . 431860_436020
*PAR0:	let's see . 436020_438040
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah like that . 438040_442860
*PAR0:	yeah &-uh huh it just depends on how like when she it'll be interesting when she comes back at ten months to see &-uh huh if she's into something completely different . 442860_452100
*PAR0:	and then when they get a little bit more mobile it changes again because they're able to reach more probably . 452100_458460
*PAR0:	okay . 458460_458720
*PAR0:	yeah . 458720_459060
*PAR0:	and then at two years there will be a play session also . 459060_461800
*PAR0:	but it's all different toys . 461800_462960
*PAR0:	okay . 462960_463520
*PAR0:	more like because these wouldn't really interest a two-year-old oh so they're just different &-um kinds of you know way more cool stuff . 463520_472080
*PAR0:	okay . 472080_472780
*PAR0:	okay . 472780_473480
*PAR0:	so anyway if you don't have anything else you want to add &-um then [/] then that that's all that we had . 473480_478700
*PAR0:	and I forgot to give you guys the a toy or a tee shirt for her . 478960_482260
*PAR0:	so I'll do that . 482320_483140
*PAR0:	and &-um I can . 483900_487500
*PAR0:	let's see . 489680_490140
