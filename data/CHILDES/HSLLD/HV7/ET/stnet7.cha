@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Transcriber:	Deborah J. Davidson , Angela L. Atkinson Duina
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	so (.) what we'd like you guys to do is just (.) play with these [= magnets] for a bit .
@Comment:	Time is 6:17
@Comment:	The mood surrounding the activity seems pleasant. Mot and Chi are friendly to each other , but spend much of their time playing independently. Mot does most of the talking. EXP remains in the background throughout the activity. Reference to the qualities of magnets is limited to comments by Mot that pennies will not stick to magnets. There is considerable experimentation with repulsion when Mot and Chi notice that different objects will move across the table because of the pressure of the magnets. Chi puts a washer underneath the plastic turtle's shell and is thus able to pick it up with the yellow wand. MOT and Chi sit at a table in the kitchen; the magnets are spread out on the table in front of them; Chi is stacking objects on the black base
*MOT:	yeah .
*MOT:	we got these [= magnets] .
*MOT:	I sent away for quite a few of them [= magnets] <didn't I> [>] ?

*MOT:	there's another one [= nut] .
%act:	hands Chi a nut from the table
%sit:	Chi is making a tower of nuts on the black base
*MOT:	(.) see if you can stand these [= washers] up like that [= on its side] on top of your tower .
*MOT:	+^ like the bigger nuts and bolts .
%com:	there are no bolts in the set
*MOT:	put them like this one .
%act:	lines up the washer on the table , comparing the line of washers to the tower of nuts
*MOT:	see if you can do that [= make a tower of washers] .
*CHI:	(.) oh !
%act:	places another nut on top of the tower
*CHI:	another thing [= nut] !
*MOT:	you like (.) magnets ?
*MOT:	that [= tower of nuts] was your best one .
*INV:	yeah look at that [= tower of nuts] !
*INV:	that's [= tower of nuts] amazing !
*MOT:	put (th)em [= washers] up [= on top of the nut tower] !
*MOT:	let's see +...

*INV:	oh !
%sit:	all washers except one fall off the tower
*MOT:	alright .
*CHI:	it's [= base magnet] powerful .
%act:	removes one of the fallen washers from the black base with some effort
*MOT:	let's try it this way .
%sit:	the washer still on the tower is perpendicular to the tower of nuts; the washer sticks out from the top of the nut tower like a small diving board; Mot hangs a washer from the bottom of the washer and wants to see how many other washers will hang like that
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	tries to hang another washer below the first one which Mot hung , but it won't attach to the other washer
*MOT:	willn't do it [= hang from the other washer] ?
%act:	tries to hang a second washer as well , but Mot's doesn't attach either and the first hanging washer swivels away (is repelled away) from the washer Mot is attempting to hang
*MOT:	watch .
*MOT:	+^ we can make it [= hanging washer] move .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	attaches a washer to the side of the nut tower , parallel to and underneath the <diving-board> washer
%com:	the diving-board washer , the one parallel to it , the hanging washer and the side of the nut tower make a square
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	tries to hang a washer below the square described above , but the washer falls
*MOT:	whoops .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	places a washer over one of the empty spaces in the square , forming five sides of a cube
*CHI:	(.) I'm building a box .
*MOT:	ugh .
%act:	removes the fallen washer from the base with effort
*CHI:	I'm building a box .
*INV:	oh neat .
*MOT:	where's my muscles ?
%com:	MOT is commenting on her difficulting removing the washer from the black base
*MOT:	mother dear ain't got no muscles .
*MOT:	huh ?
*MOT:	well the xxx is down !
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	about right now Chi would be takin(g) a tantrum and throwin(g) (th)em .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	let's put it [= washer] down on this one [= unfinished side of the cube] here .
*MOT:	this one [= unfinished side of the cube] .
%act:	indicates the unfinished side of the cube with her finger
*MOT:	I'm gonna put another one .
*MOT:	we'll put him [= silver man] there [= on the unfinished side of the cube] .
%sit:	MOT tries to use a silver man to cover the open side , but Chi puts a washer there instead; in doing so Chi causes the bottom to fall out of the cube , but it remains attached to the structure
%com:	Chi is unaware that the bottom of the cube has fallen out
*MOT:	no ?
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	tries to reattach the bottom of the cube , but it falls
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	willn't work .
%com:	<$=8> Mot and Chi speak in low voices and it's very hard to hear them

*MOT:	(.) oh let's make a (.) bridge .
*MOT:	(le)t us take this [= tower of nuts] one down .
%sit:	MOT and Chi remove objects from the black base
*MOT:	don't take it [= objects on black base] all down .
*MOT:	+^ and you know what we'll do ?
*MOT:	we'll put one of these [= silver stick] through it [= hole in nut] .
%act:	puts a silver stick through the hole in a nut
*MOT:	like this .
%act:	holds up a nut on one of the silver sticks
%sit:	Chi plays with the silver bowl and black base; ignoring Mot
*MOT:	like this here .
%sit:	MOT continues holding the nut on the stick , and Chi looks at it briefly
*MOT:	and so [?] this [= nut] +...

*MOT:	and this [= nut] one over here [= on black base , next_to the first nut] +...
*MOT:	and put one [= nut] in the middle [= in_between the other two nuts] so +...
*MOT:	no .
%com:	MOT changes her mind about putting a nut in between the other two
*MOT:	see that one [= nut which was on the silver stick] ?
%act:	removes the nut from the silver stick and holds it out for Chi
*CHI:	that .
%act:	places a smaller nut on each of the larger nuts which have been placed on the black base .
*MOT:	yeah .
*MOT:	here's another one [= nut] .
%act:	picks the nut up and sets it aside on the table
*MOT:	and another one [= nut] .
*MOT:	let's put this there .
%act:	holds out the silver stick for Chi
*MOT:	xxx .
%act:	puts the silver stick through the center of a nut which is on the black base
*CHI:	hey mommy .
%sit:	Chi doesn't want Mot to put the silver stick there; Mot removes the stick
*MOT:	huh ?
*MOT:	what are you gonna do ?
*MOT:	it's [= nuts which Chi is stacking on black base] all gonna [: going to] go downhill [=? down here] .
%act:	points to the area on the base where the structure might fall
*MOT:	watch .
*MOT:	+^ it'll [= Chi's structure] go down .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
%sit:	Chi is struggling to get a washer to attach to the nuts on the black base
*MOT:	think you got it [= got the washer to stick to the nuts] ?
*INV:	can you do it [= get the washer to stick to nuts] ?
*MOT:	yep .
*INV:	<oh awesome> [>] !
%sit:	Chi has constructed an arching bridge on the black base
*MOT:	<pretty nice isn't it> [<] ?
*MOT:	I thought it [= bridge] was gonna go down .

*CHI:	0 [<] .
%act:	prepares to place another washer on the bridge; in doing so , one of the bridge pieces falls .
*INV:	oh !
%sit:	another bridge piece falls
*MOT:	whoop(s) !
*MOT:	whoop(s) !
*MOT:	maybe that one +//.
*MOT:	+^ maybe those bolts [= nuts] are too heavy .
*MOT:	+^ why don't you try these [= washers] ?
*MOT:	+^ or try this [= silver stick] (.) across [= the top of the bridge] +...
*MOT:	&=laughs .
%sit:	Chi is having difficulty removing a washer from the black base
*MOT:	try that one [= silver stick] .
*CHI:	(.) this [= removing objects from the black base] will build the muscles .
*MOT:	mhm .
*CHI:	scarecrow .
%sit:	Chi has stacked the nuts , making a tower; a silver stick is placed on top of the tower and perpendicular to it , like the arms of a scarecrow
*MOT:	scarecrow ?
*MOT:	(..) (wh)oops !
*MOT:	see how it [= nut] went right down ?
%sit:	a nut which Chi placed on the top of the nut tower fell off , and rolled down the side of the tower
*MOT:	put him [= silver man] up on the top [= of the tower] .
%sit:	atop the tower of nuts is a silver stick , standing straight up; Mot suggests putting the silver man on top of the silver stick .
*MOT:	like king of the hill .
*MOT:	look xxx .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	tries to balance the silver man on the silver stick , but is unable to do it

*MOT:	but these [= thin refrigerator magnets] ain't got no +...
%act:	repeatedly touches the thin magnet to the black base; it does not seem to stick
*CHI:	I like this (.) turtle .
%act:	picks up the plastic turtle
*MOT:	here's [= next_to and under the silver bowl] more of these [= washers] .
*CHI:	jeez !
%act:	removes an object from the bottom of the silver bowl , which is apparently magnetic
*MOT:	okay watch .
*MOT:	xxx .
%act:	pushes over a green triangle on the black base
*INV:	hm: !
%sit:	using the yellow wand , Chi places a washer atop the silver stick which is standing straight up; it stays briefly , and then falls

*MOT:	where's your balls xxx ?
*MOT:	you got a whole bunch of these [= red , orange , and yellow balls] .
*CHI:	ugh .
%act:	tries to put the yellow wand on the black base , but the base and the wand repel each other
*CHI:	+^ try to put this [= yellow wand] on here [= black base] .
*MOT:	put what ?
*MOT:	it's [= black base's] movin(g) on you &=laughs !
%sit:	as Chi tries to place the wand on the black base , the base is repelled and moves across the table

*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	I'm gonna move it [= black base] on you .
%sit:	Chi tries to remove the silver stick from the tower of nuts; Mot moves the base , upon which the tower stands , toward Chi with the wand; this catches Chi off-guard
*MOT:	(.) that side [= of the base] don't work .
%com:	the side to which Mot refers attracts the wand instead of repelling it
*MOT:	(..) oh look at that !
%act:	slides the wand across the table and picks up various objects
*MOT:	huh ?
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	here you go .
%sit:	Chi holds the silver bowl in the air with various magnetic objects dangling from it; Mot puts the yellow wand at the bottom of the dangling objects; the objects stick to the wand and detach from the silver bowl
