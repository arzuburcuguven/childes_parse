@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Transcriber:	Deborah J. Davidson , Karen Auerbach
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	what we're doing is we're gonna focus on your hands for this .
@Comment:	Time is 18:41
@Comment:	Chi is very self-directed and spends a good deal of time using the yellow wand to move magnet balls on the black base. Science talk centers around what objects do or don't stick and does not extend to why the yellow wand makes the balls move. Chi's siblings are in and out of the room , and there is constant talking in the background , maybe in another room. Chi's her youngest sister is present for a good portion of the activity , which causes some distraction. Video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
*INV:	www .
%com:	explains activity; tells them it will be for about ten minutes
*CHI:	oh yeah .
*CHI:	I missed these [?] .
*INV:	www .
