*PAR0:	mhm . 230940_231240

*PAR0:	and was there anything you tried to get him to play with that he wasn't interested in . 312300_316820
*PAR0:	I tried to steer him back to the animals . 316820_318660
*PAR0:	but it's fine . 318660_321220
*PAR0:	he was on the mind . 321220_322940
*PAR0:	so &-um what about &-uh things you have at home that we didn't have . 322940_328620
*PAR0:	here . 328620_328840
*PAR0:	is there anything that he likes to play with cars and trucks . 328840_331520
*PAR0:	yeah . 331520_334180
*PAR0:	if you notice that from the pictures and that is a common thing . 334180_339820
*PAR0:	especially voices or cars and trucks and &-um anything else . 339820_345480
*PAR0:	any place at home . 345480_346500
*PAR0:	&-um let's see . 346500_352720
*PAR0:	yeah stuffed animals cars and trucks . 352720_354500
*PAR0:	lots of books . 354500_355280
*PAR0:	you know what else . 355280_356860
*PAR0:	do you like to play with other vehicles . 356860_360600
*PAR0:	blocks . 360600_362020
*PAR0:	well you [/] you did blocks with the tests . 362020_366880
*PAR0:	I know buddy . 366880_367500
*PAR0:	I know we still have a little bit left . 367500_370480
*PAR0:	&-um well he is kind of in that what's this mode because you just played all those games with him . 370480_384400
*PAR0:	he doesn't always ask about everything . 384400_386820
*PAR0:	he picks up . 386820_387900
*PAR0:	&-um but he still is kind of in the just oh boy in the mostly literal play . 387900_398360
*PAR0:	he doesn't do a whole lot of pretending other than pretending to eat it . 398360_401820
*PAR0:	a little [/] little bit of pretending to cook things and playing with those toys and cars and trucks . 401820_408060
*PAR0:	they drive around . 408060_408660
*PAR0:	and sometimes they talk to each other . 408660_410240
*PAR0:	but they're not [/] not huge into pretend play yet . 410240_414880
*PAR0:	yeah I guess the cars and trucks talking is a little pretend play . 414880_418960
*PAR0:	yeah . 418960_419300
*PAR0:	alright . 419300_422300
*PAR0:	&-uh very confident very &-uh easy he really was I mean he's [/] he's a pretty good . 427180_435520
*PAR0:	boy . 435520_435900
*PAR0:	yeah . 436180_436400
*PAR0:	&-um so we you have played Sushi really two year old I that's &-uh actually they are they seem to be popping up a lot more . 437140_447740
*PAR0:	I don't know why . 447740_448560
*PAR0:	&-um but I know like you know my [/] my brother found some at one point and gave it to &-uh one our cousins . 448560_459480
*PAR0:	&-um and &-uh it's I guess your parent if your parents eat it . 459480_466880
*PAR0:	yeah . 467320_467380
*PAR0:	then you wanna play with it too . 467500_468680
*PAR0:	they never have the foods that we eat . 469180_472880
*PAR0:	we're just like meat and potatoes people . 473280_475440
*PAR0:	right . 475720_476000
*PAR0:	&-uh and it does say beets hard to read because of all the years of teaspoons . 477580_499280
*PAR0:	chicken salad . 499280_507700
*PAR0:	maybe . 507700_508100
*PAR0:	yeah . 508100_509780
*PAR0:	okay . 509780_515520
*PAR0:	so just &-uh to finish off because this is the end of the &-um longitudinal study . 515520_520760
*PAR0:	mm . 520980_521000
*PAR0:	hm . 521000_521100
*PAR0:	so &-um we have two more consent forms . 521260_523160
*PAR0:	okay . 523600_523860
*PAR0:	&-um so I'll explain them to you and then have you sign them . 524240_526960
*PAR0:	&-um so since this is the it would be bad if I didn't sign them now . 527700_530380
*PAR0:	huh . 530380_530540
*PAR0:	yeah . 530560_530780
*PAR0:	so since this is the end we explain more &-um you know what the aim of the study was what we were looking at . 531520_537620
*PAR0:	you're doing a good job putting those in the basket . 537620_539660
*PAR0:	Daniel thanks . 539660_541960
*PAR0:	&-um so while we were listening to Daniel's language &-um throughout the you know for seven months all the way up to three years &-um we were also &-um recording portions of your speech . 541960_552960
*PAR0:	mm . 553220_553240
*PAR0:	&-um so that was during the play session . 553540_555620
*PAR0:	so we were please don't need it for real . 555880_557280
*PAR0:	Daryl just pretend . 557280_558060
*PAR0:	okay . 558740_558920
*PAR0:	so we were &-um we were comparing how you would talk . 559700_564380
*PAR0:	to him and then how he would &-um respond to us in [/] in [/] in interview . 564380_568000
*PAR0:	so &-um this [/] this is the final consent form . 568220_572540
*PAR0:	and then we'll have an additional one . 572560_573700
*PAR0:	so the final just explains that [/] that we've already recorded the speech samples as part of the play sessions . 573700_579600
*PAR0:	but with your you know permission we will go back and analyze it for things such as your speaking rate . 579600_586580
*PAR0:	how carefully you pronounce words you know variety of words you use different things like that . 586580_595660
*PAR0:	and we're gonna do this both for your speech and for Dan's speech . 595660_600220
*PAR0:	so yeah this you can look over it if you want . 600220_603620
*PAR0:	and just kind of explain that . 603620_605100
*PAR0:	and then there's a place to sign this on the back . 605100_609000
*PAR0:	and then I'll explain the additional stuff in . 609000_612440
*PAR0:	I was thinking that might happen . 612440_615620
*PAR0:	is that why you put everything back in the basket . 615620_617560
*PAR0:	so make a big dump . 617560_621640
*PAR0:	what are you doing with that basket . 621640_624680
*PAR0:	nice like a mask . 624680_629000
*PAR0:	it went on your head . 629420_633600
*PAR0:	yes . 633600_639280
*PAR0:	okay . 639280_639920
*PAR0:	so the additional consent form . 639920_642480
*PAR0:	this part is completely optional . 642480_644400
*PAR0:	it's not really I mean it's part of the study but it's not necessary for you know &-um but what it explains is that &-um recently researchers been putting together an international database of China child and parent speech . 644400_659820
*PAR0:	mhm . 660140_660300
*PAR0:	&-um to you know so that they can have this database that they can access and listen for &-um whatever study is doing . 660480_669120
*PAR0:	you know . 669120_669440
*PAR0:	so &-um this part is completely voluntary . 669440_672340
*PAR0:	this is a little more natural . 672860_674000
*PAR0:	one of the things said . 674140_674920
*PAR0:	yeah you know how are these play sessions . 675080_676600
*PAR0:	different from at home . 676600_677540
*PAR0:	I was like . 677540_678280
*PAR0:	there's much less silliness . 678280_679240
*PAR0:	yeah . 679640_679660
*PAR0:	so that's more normal . 680660_681220
*PAR0:	yeah that's good . 681520_682460
*PAR0:	&-um so this one &-um kinda comes [/] comes in [/] in three [/] three varieties [/] varieties that [/] that &-um you're [/] you're free [/] free to [/] to pick [/] pick any [/] any of [/] of the three . 684200_689940
*PAR0:	just put an exclamation there whichever one . 689940_693120
*PAR0:	so the first variety is I do not want any of my data or my child's data to be made available to other language researchers . 693120_700720
*PAR0:	meaning it would just be available for us here at University of Maryland for this particular study option . 700720_723440
*PAR0:	sorry . 723500_723680
*PAR0:	Buddy I couldn't help it . 723680_727740
*PAR0:	can I put stuff back in the basket now or I could have it made available . 727740_737220
*PAR0:	partially is obviously the second option . 737220_739740
*PAR0:	right . 739740_739900
*PAR0:	so the second option is &-uh anonymous transcripts and test score data . 739900_743740
*PAR0:	so that would &-um we would listen to it here do a written transcript of it . 743740_749220
*PAR0:	and &-um that would be uploaded with all personal information taken out . 749220_753040
*PAR0:	you know if you say his name or his name anything like that . 753040_755820
*PAR0:	that would all be what's this out a basket . 755940_759080
*PAR0:	I put it on my head . 759840_760880
*PAR0:	you did put it on your head . 760900_764520
