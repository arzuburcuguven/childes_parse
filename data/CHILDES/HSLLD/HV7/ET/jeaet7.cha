@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	I am going to (.) tape you .
@Comment:	Time is 15:10
@Comment:	MOT and Chi work well together. Chi does most of the actual playing , but uses suggestions from the Mot. There is little to no science talk. Magnets are on a table; Mot and Chi are seated at nearby corners of the table; there are some objects stuck to the black base and some in a pile beside it
*INV:	www .
%exp:	says that she will only tape hands; explains magnets activity and that the activity will go for ten minutes
*MOT:	that's it .
*INV:	www .
%exp:	talks about moving something
*MOT:	this [= yellow wand] (.) is neat .
%act:	picks up yellow wand and sticks it to black base
*CHI:	xxx .
*CHI:	take all them [= objects on black base] off .
%act:	begins to pull objects off black base
*MOT:	(o)kay .
%act:	pulls objects off yellow wand
*MOT:	oh these [= magnet balls] are magnets Chi .
%act:	drops a magnet ball onto the black base
*MOT:	oh !
*MOT:	(..) &=laughs .
*MOT:	(.) (o)kay .
*MOT:	(.) let's build something Chi .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up a silver stick and attempts to stand it up on the black base
*MOT:	I don't think that'll [= silver stick] stand up .
*MOT:	if you go maybe like that it might .
%act:	leans silver stick against a silver magnet ball on the black base
*CHI:	they're xxx .
*MOT:	(o)kay .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	drops magnet balls onto the black base
*CHI:	(..) now let's find some of these .
%int:	whispered
*MOT:	get the xxx going .
*MOT:	this person [= silver man] +...
%act:	puts a silver man on black base; then takes him off
*MOT:	here .
*MOT:	+^ stand him [= silver man] up .
%act:	hands silver man to Chi
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	tries repeatedly to stand silver man up on the black base but is unsuccessful
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	I bet I can get him [= silver man] to stand on his head .
%act:	places silver man on his head on a plastic magnet ball
*MOT:	here .
*MOT:	have him [= silver man] stand on his head .
%act:	picks up another silver man from table and holds it out to Chi
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up a silver man from the table and puts him on his head on a magnet ball
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	hey have these things [= silver man] stand on top of this one [= silver man already on base] .
*MOT:	+^ &-uh .
%act:	attempts to stack a silver man on top of another , but the silver man falls over
*MOT:	+^ whoop(s) !
*CHI:	xxx like that .
%act:	points to two silver men that she has stuck together on the black base
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	mom look .
%act:	again indicates the silver men
*MOT:	oh yeah .
*CHI:	xxx .
%int:	whispered
*MOT:	(..) oh look here Chi .
%act:	holds a nut and silver ball which are stuck together over a plastic magnet ball on the platform; the plastic magnet ball moves
*MOT:	(.) &~aw .
%act:	attempts unsuccessfully to stick a dime to the black base
*MOT:	+^ this [= dime] doesn't stick !
*MOT:	this [= dime] doesn't stick .
%act:	attempts unsuccessfully to stick a penny to the black base
*MOT:	(.) none o(f) the money sticks .
*MOT:	oh I know .

*MOT:	0 [=! clears throat] .
*MOT:	(.) is that [= silver circle?] a magnet ?
%act:	places a washer on the silver circle
*MOT:	no .
*MOT:	I thought +//.
*MOT:	+^ yeah it is !
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	0 [=! clears throat] .
*CHI:	(..) I'm making a smily face .
%sit:	Chi is constructing a face on the silver circle with two washers for eyes , a nut for a nose , and a silver stick for a mouth
*MOT:	now that's [= face construction] a good idea !
*MOT:	how (a)bout if we do it [= mouth] with clips ?
%act:	removes silver stick from silver circle
*MOT:	make the smily face with paper clips .
*MOT:	pink .
*MOT:	for the lips .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	takes the paper clips and puts them on the silver circle
*MOT:	(.) oh .

*MOT:	(.) hm: .
*MOT:	doesn't wanna stay up there .
*MOT:	(wh)oop(s) !
*MOT:	here .
*MOT:	+^ try it like this .
%act:	reaches over and tries to adjust paper clip so that it stays; it doesn't work
*MOT:	whoop(s) .
*MOT:	(.) there .
%com:	the paper clips stay in place

*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	(.) &=laughs .
