*PAR0:	do you think he knows any of the names for any of these toys . 47900_51280

*PAR0:	&-um but I don't know if he knows the word peas . 56720_60340
*PAR0:	I don't think that he knows the word book . 60900_63120
*PAR0:	he has a lot of books . 63180_63860
*PAR0:	and he really usually at home if he's playing independently . 63860_66820
*PAR0:	he's sitting down flipping through his books . 66820_68800
*PAR0:	don't know why . 68940_69700
*PAR0:	but &-um I guess he doesn't really do that when I'm playing with him all that much . 69700_74880
*PAR0:	but I don't think he knows the names . 75240_78860
*PAR0:	he knows the names of his two favorite stuffed animals that he actually interacts with . 78860_84120
*PAR0:	but I don't think he knows their names as [/] as though he would recognize them . 84120_88840
*PAR0:	there's a teddy bear . 88840_89680
*PAR0:	and there's a kind of a &-uh there's a monkey . 89680_93300
*PAR0:	but it doesn't really look like a monkey . 93300_96440
*PAR0:	my brother had like one of those like puff of love things . 96440_99420
*PAR0:	and he was obsessed . 99420_100160
*PAR0:	he knew the name of that . 100160_102760
*PAR0:	yeah . 102760_103360
*PAR0:	&-um so what other kind of toys . 103360_105420
*PAR0:	does he play with at home besides like the stuff the animals and the books . 105420_108680
*PAR0:	&-um he has the stacking rings . 108680_111420
*PAR0:	he's starting to be done with those and blocks mostly [/] mostly likes and well you know pots and pans in our kitchen mostly likes banging things together at this point . 111420_123140
*PAR0:	blocks and pots and pans are good for that . 124780_127580
*PAR0:	and these slices of bread were good for that for a brief time here too . 128100_131600
*PAR0:	mhm . 131780_132040
*PAR0:	&-um do you ever play [/] play pretend with him or cut home or . 133200_137340
*PAR0:	&-um he's only starting to notice that a little bit with the stuffed animals . 137340_141980
*PAR0:	mhm . 141980_142540
*PAR0:	just a little &-um . 142540_146920
*PAR0:	I don't know if ask you or if [/] if he's eating I'll pretend to eat his food . 146920_152900
*PAR0:	that's as close as it gets . 152900_154400
*PAR0:	how like because this is your third visit . 154400_157240
*PAR0:	and you've had like two other play sessions . 157240_158960
*PAR0:	how has it changed . 158960_159980
*PAR0:	like his interest in like what toys . 159980_161340
*PAR0:	he goes for . 161340_162440
*PAR0:	well the first time he kind of seemed intimidated by everything . 162440_167260
*PAR0:	he didn't want to touch any of the toys because they were completely unfamiliar . 167260_170740
*PAR0:	but &-um last year last time he started playing with these toys a little bit . 170740_177360
*PAR0:	and it seemed like he recognized them because last time he played with the bread and the peas a lot . 177360_181040
*PAR0:	mm . 181160_181660
*PAR0:	so I think that he was more comfortable with them . 181840_186140
*PAR0:	so . 186640_186840
*PAR0:	h that's why he was a little more like himself . 186840_188900
*PAR0:	yeah still pretty &-uh stationary which is not that like himself . 189600_193160
*PAR0:	he's usually moving all over the place . 193200_195160
*PAR0:	what's that . 195160_198540
*PAR0:	and I probably am more stationary than I am at home too . 198540_206600
*PAR0:	probably because of the wire . 206600_207800
*PAR0:	I would usually crawl around . 207800_208980
*PAR0:	and yeah toss him in . 208980_211000
*PAR0:	the air that kind of thing . 211000_211880
*PAR0:	shy . 211900_212240
*PAR0:	I'll try and give you guys a little bit of I know but still yeah I what mean . 212240_217520
*PAR0:	yeah . 217520_219040
*PAR0:	so is there anything else you felt like [/] like compared to what he has at home or you think that you thought he would be interested in more or . 219040_227720
*PAR0:	yeah I'm the only time he these are his favorite books at home or pretty much . 227720_233520
*PAR0:	but the only time he noticed them here was the first time I was here . 233520_238120
*PAR0:	it's kind of weird . 238120_238960
*PAR0:	but &-um yeah the stuffed animals . 238960_245020
*PAR0:	we don't have any of this size because they usually say like not suitable for kids under three years . 245020_251480
*PAR0:	&-um but he's like [/] like I said he only has just started being interested in his stuffed animals and play food . 251480_260520
*PAR0:	we just don't have any because he's our first . 260520_262900
*PAR0:	and so it's not like it's more of a preschooler toy . 262900_265560
*PAR0:	yeah sure . 266080_266780
*PAR0:	but he sees it at the nursery . 268140_271240
*PAR0:	he's in a nursery for like an hour twice a week . 271240_273200
*PAR0:	but he sees it there . 273200_274760
*PAR0:	sees the other kids playing with him . 274760_276780
*PAR0:	it's not any time about bread . 277340_278720
*PAR0:	I have no idea I think it's because it has an interesting texture . 278920_285280
*PAR0:	yes . 285500_285760
*PAR0:	and it's solid . 286360_287640
*PAR0:	so it makes a nice noise . 287640_288760
*PAR0:	he sees me eat sandwiches . 288940_293020
*PAR0:	that's about it . 293020_294340
*PAR0:	and our bread doesn't we yeah it doesn't quite look like he was very interested in you . 294340_307540
*PAR0:	this time . 307540_308000
*PAR0:	the last few times he's ignored the person sitting there . 308000_310380
*PAR0:	but this time he kept looking over at you probably should have started with eye roll ta [/] ta talkie . 310380_319180
*PAR0:	do you think he knows any colors for anything or if it's probably . 321280_327560
*PAR0:	not yet . 327560_328480
*PAR0:	I don't think he knows the words for them . 328480_330320
*PAR0:	&-um but he definitely has a preference for yellow . 330320_334040
*PAR0:	mhm . 335140_335520
*PAR0:	mhm . 336020_336280
*PAR0:	but I don't know if he knows the words for any colors . 336780_339680
*PAR0:	oh that was a nice little clap . 341300_344120
*PAR0:	are you happy . 344300_345920
*PAR0:	I'm also surprised he hasn't taken his socks off . 345920_350100
*PAR0:	yeah . 350100_350980
*PAR0:	usually as soon as he's in a place where he has access to his socks they're off . 350980_358500
*PAR0:	that's it . 358500_366980
*PAR0:	now I have to buy Daniel some . 373640_374740
