@Comment:	MOT asks Chi if she would remembers the story of The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Chi does not seem to remember much , but does not take the time to re-read it. Chi begins writing the letter when Mot leaves to answer the phone. EXP helps Chi write the author's first name , and Mot returns to help Chi with the rest. Chi writes only one sentence and decides that is all she would like to write. Mot jokes that Chi's letter is the shortest one she has ever read before.
