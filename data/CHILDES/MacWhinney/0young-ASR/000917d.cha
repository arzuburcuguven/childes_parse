*FAT:	here . 475505_475795
*FAT:	okay . 478655_478945
*FAT:	today is the &-uh twenty ninth of November and &-uh yesterday Ross told me that he wanted &-uh thief . 478945_487305
*FAT:	actually it was kind of like pet . 489385_490665
*FAT:	I don't know the [/] the it was an f on the end . 491265_493505
*FAT:	it was an e .
*FAT:	but it was the beginning sound was like pet [/] pet . 493525_498145
*FAT:	so he was trying to do something funny with it . 498485_500465
*FAT:	and that was a toothbrush . 500565_501545
*FAT:	but later he was telling Mary about a toothbrush that he wanted brush . 502325_506225
*FAT:	and &-uh this morning at the breakfast table he wanted my wallet which was Puss [/] Puss and &-um the &-uh so he is clearly using purse for both purse and wallet I guess that's reasonable . 507805_522785
*FAT:	they both have money in them . 522905_523625
*FAT:	and so &-uh Mary also points out that he uses book as somewhat over generalized . 523625_530105
*FAT:	that book refers not only to his puzzles but also to a little writing tablet &-uh that is stored with his books . 530105_537885
*FAT:	of course it's all very reasonable since all those things are together . 538385_540885
*FAT:	and we bring them down at the same time . 541305_542965
*FAT:	&-uh <and he> [/] and he plays with them in the same way that they should be books . 543745_547765
*FAT:	but he doesn't differentiate between books that have pages and those that don't . 548145_551405
*FAT:	of course some of his books don't have very clear pages either . 551405_553725
*FAT:	so &-uh it's understandable . 553945_556325
*FAT:	and let's see . 557945_558605
*FAT:	&-um I think I already said that he said &-uh about two days ago . 559385_563125
