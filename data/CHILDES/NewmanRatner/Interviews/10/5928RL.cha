*PAR0:	what do you think . 0_860
*PAR0:	&-uh Rosie liked &-uh the most today . 860_4700
*PAR0:	well definitely these little measuring spoons I think these have been the hit the food stuff has been the hit and the measuring spoons not as much the stuffed animals or books this time . 4700_21900
*PAR0:	last time they were more popular . 22500_24960
*PAR0:	I think I remember her being more into the [/] the books and at definitely like this stuffed animal last time really got her . 25180_32620
*PAR0:	and this time she was much more interested in the food . 32920_35500
*PAR0:	she's more surprised . 37280_39120
*PAR0:	do you remember him . 40100_41220
*PAR0:	I didn't wanna prompt you . 41700_44400
*PAR0:	I wanted to see if you would remember him on your own . 44480_46300
*PAR0:	but I don't think you cared as much this time about him . 46380_48520
*PAR0:	oh now it's serious . 48640_52300
*PAR0:	yeah exactly it's on . 52340_54540
*PAR0:	do you think &-uh she's familiar with some of the names that &-uh you called the foods [/] foods or . 55060_60660
*PAR0:	yeah I think so like especially peas &-um bread . 60660_65300
*PAR0:	&-um like she had that for breakfast this morning . 65300_68940
*PAR0:	so you know we talk about bread and toast . 68940_71660
*PAR0:	we talk about measuring spoons because she likes to play &-um with like plastic stuff I have in the kitchen now that I'll put on thethe floor for her and stuff don't have any plastic measuring spoons . 71660_81620
*PAR0:	but she has lots . 81700_82600
*PAR0:	she sees me with this kind of stuff a lot . 82860_84840
*PAR0:	so yeah we'll call things cheese you know peas &-um carrots . 85740_96140
*PAR0:	she hears all that stuff . 96320_97600
*PAR0:	okay . 98620_99040
*PAR0:	how about food that &-uh you and &-um her dad might eat something like hamburgers pizza . 99380_106520
*PAR0:	ice . 106520_107140
*PAR0:	yeah . 107140_107600
*PAR0:	&-um you mean the of words I would have said today or just . 108200_112880
*PAR0:	in general words that she would hear or that we would eat and talk about or . 112880_116900
*PAR0:	yeah I guess of what you've said today because that would be in context of what we have . 116980_120340
*PAR0:	yeah the foods here &-um cheese definitely her mommy and daddy both like cheese . 120340_125880
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh icing her dad does eat icing peanut butter is something that I eat a lot . 126440_135760
*PAR0:	and so she would hear that a lot . 135980_137600
*PAR0:	okay . 137720_138460
*PAR0:	look at her . 138620_139180
*PAR0:	now she's like remembering that's my friend like . 139180_143240
*PAR0:	oh I remember this hair . 143240_144740
*PAR0:	&-um does she have baby dolls at home . 145060_149480
*PAR0:	&-um she doesn't have any that look like b this per say . 149780_154660
*PAR0:	but over [/] over the last month since she was here last we've put more soft toys in her crib . 154960_160640
*PAR0:	and that includes a couple that look like dolls . 160640_163880
*PAR0:	&-um one looks more like a baby . 163880_166560
*PAR0:	the other one is kind of this crazy yarn . 166560_168740
*PAR0:	but it's the figure of a baby . 168740_171100
*PAR0:	so I think since last time especially she's had more plush kind of toys around including dolls . 171100_177280
*PAR0:	well I [/] I was interested to see how she'd react to this one because we have a bright baby touch and feel baby animals book . 177280_200560
*PAR0:	and it has like the gosling kind of you know ducks it has this . 200560_205120
*PAR0:	and she usually at home will kind of she knows where to feel now . 205120_209660
*PAR0:	and she kind of did that with the lamb . 209660_211520
*PAR0:	but then she was kind of done with the book . 211520_213180
*PAR0:	and so that was interesting to me just because she knew to touch here like the one at home . 213180_218580
*PAR0:	but she kind of knew this book . 218580_220300
*PAR0:	and so was kind of not as interested . 220300_222240
*PAR0:	and &-um you know at home we have like a slightly different version of this one . 222240_228440
*PAR0:	but she's much more into it at home . 228440_231300
*PAR0:	the like lifting of the flaps and this . 231320_233140
*PAR0:	so it was interesting to me that at home she'll sit on my lap . 233140_236620
*PAR0:	she'll turn the pages . 236620_238460
*PAR0:	she'll you know giggle when we lift things up . 238460_241320
*PAR0:	but here she wasn't as into the books as stuff she doesn't have at home . 241320_244700
*PAR0:	we don't have you know food stuff at home yet . 244700_247840
*PAR0:	so that seems to be more of what she was interested in . 247840_250960
*PAR0:	so I think of the books probably the ones I picked up . 251320_255160
*PAR0:	but I don't think she would have even touched them if I hadn't picked them up . 255160_258280
*PAR0:	okay . 258440_258760
*PAR0:	I think she was more into this stuff . 259320_261140
*PAR0:	and you play &-um Peekaboo at home . 262100_264660
*PAR0:	yeah . 264680_265080
*PAR0:	we play Peekaboo now she gets more into Peekaboo you want to show your fight face . 265280_270760
*PAR0:	you want to show your new fight face . 270760_273540
*PAR0:	but she's really into noises right now being able to make noises bang things together . 273540_279820
*PAR0:	she's curious about things that she'll hit together that won't make a noise you know versus ones that do make a noise . 279820_286200
*PAR0:	so any kind of self enclosed [/] enclosed noise maker could keep her attention a really long time now . 286200_292500
*PAR0:	okay . 292500_293400
*PAR0:	all relative you know but for her age I think especially yeah . 293400_300120
*PAR0:	how about animals &-um in general like names of animals that she might be familiar with or trying to get everyone familiar with . 300120_312820
*PAR0:	&-um yeah we when we do books a lot of the books are animal books . 312820_317640
*PAR0:	so you know she has like a little farm set at home . 317640_320560
*PAR0:	so we talk about cows a lot . 320560_322580
*PAR0:	&-um so . 322580_324600
*PAR0:	like animals from books like duck . 324600_327000
*PAR0:	and she's got an animal puzzle . 327000_329080
*PAR0:	so we talk about animals cat dog kitten sheep lamb &-um &-uh lots of cow horse pig . 329080_339100
*PAR0:	so all kind of your basic domestic animals . 339100_342080
*PAR0:	&-um we have some like wild animal books . 342080_345520
*PAR0:	but frankly I don't like reptiles . 345520_347460
*PAR0:	so I don't like the Reptile books . 347460_348800
*PAR0:	so I'm totally biasing her against reptiles already . 348800_352020
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah she would probably know most of those kind of animal sounds from puzzles books . 352320_360140
*PAR0:	there's songs we sing Old Mcdonald she doesn't really have too many like stuffed animals that we talk about . 360680_369360
*PAR0:	but mostly from books . 369540_370920
*PAR0:	and then like little play sets and puzzles and stuff like that . 370920_375280
*PAR0:	okay . 376200_376960
*PAR0:	yeah . 377220_377540
*PAR0:	is this how you would play at home with &-uh like if you had food at home you would play similarly . 378320_385800
*PAR0:	yeah . 385800_386140
*PAR0:	probably we would probably &-um &-uh in terms of the food . 386140_392340
*PAR0:	I'm sure she would turn it into noise maker and kind of gnaw on stuff . 392340_396840
*PAR0:	because she seems to gnaw on everything right now . 396840_398880
*PAR0:	&-um we would probably play like that . 398880_402040
*PAR0:	I'm'm sure I would like pretend to eat stuff . 402040_404400
*PAR0:	she plays with her food when she eats it . 404520_406320
*PAR0:	now I mean I'll give her a tray full of just apple pieces cheese pieces bread pieces whatever . 406380_412880
*PAR0:	and just let her play . 412880_414280
*PAR0:	and what <goes in her mouth> [/] goes in her mouth . 414400_416020
*PAR0:	her dad will not do that because he's way too clean . 416060_418620
*PAR0:	and that just freaks him out that she's all like foodie . 418620_422260
*PAR0:	and it's all over her . 422260_423100
*PAR0:	but I [/] I like that to just let her explore real food . 423180_426880
*PAR0:	which is why I think she's such . 427420_428560
*PAR0:	a good eater because she'll just put anything that we give her in her mouth now . 428560_433660
*PAR0:	so that's probably how we would play if we're reading books . 434040_437640
*PAR0:	you know she'll sit on my lap and we'll read or she'll be doing other stuff . 437640_443220
*PAR0:	and I'll be reading to her . 443220_444540
*PAR0:	those are kind of the two ways we usually do that . 444540_447200
*PAR0:	&-um I have some of her books memorized . 447200_449860
*PAR0:	so I'll just recite them to her like nursery rhymes . 449860_454100
*PAR0:	we do that a lot . 454100_455060
*PAR0:	we do lots of nursery rhymes that we act . 455500_458920
*PAR0:	yeah you know we'll do Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . 458920_466960
*PAR0:	and I'll put her on the couch . 466960_468120
*PAR0:	and she'll have a great fall . 468120_469560
*PAR0:	and then you know and then I'll do different . 469560_472780
*PAR0:	I change them though like <I don't> [/] I don't like some of the words of like you know there was an old woman who lived in a shoe . 472780_480960
*PAR0:	she had so many children she didn't know what to do . 480960_483020
*PAR0:	so she whipped them all soundly . 483020_484620
*PAR0:	and you know put them to bed . 484620_486380
*PAR0:	and I don't like that . 486380_487560
*PAR0:	so we changed the words . 487560_488960
*PAR0:	and a lot of times I'll put her name into nursery rhymes . 488960_492920
*PAR0:	and you know Rosie [/] Rosie sat on a wall . 492920_496480
*PAR0:	Rosie [/] Rosie a great fall . 496480_498660
*PAR0:	all the king's horses and all the king's men put Rosie right back together again . 498660_502520
*PAR0:	so we'll do stuff like that and have fun with it . 502520_506700
*PAR0:	we have lots of nursery rhyme books . 506700_509260
*PAR0:	because that in the beginning seemed to be the only thing that would kind of keep her attention in terms of books . 509260_516700
*PAR0:	the one thing we don't really play with is like stuffed animals like . 516700_520380
*PAR0:	I'm realizing we don't really have a lot around . 520380_522980
*PAR0:	and <I don't> [/] I don't really . 522980_525960
*PAR0:	ever play with those with her . 525960_527960
*PAR0:	they're mostly just like crib toys which to be honest . 527960_531660
*PAR0:	I put in the crib . 531660_532460
*PAR0:	so they're quiet so that when she wakes up before we do she's not in there banging stuff . 532460_536360
*PAR0:	that's loud . 536360_536920
*PAR0:	that's when you get your soft toys right . 537960_540960
*PAR0:	that's when you get and church toys we give you quiet toys for when mommy's with you in church . 541340_547020
*PAR0:	that is very good strategy . 548560_550740
*PAR0:	yes . 550920_551260
*PAR0:	because we've made the mistake of this like banging down on the ground before nothing like that to mess up people's attention . 551540_559680
*PAR0:	yeah . 559680_561820
*PAR0:	what did you find . 561820_563360
*PAR0:	what is it . 563360_564520
*PAR0:	you want to give me the peas . 564520_566640
*PAR0:	you want you give me the peas [/] <peas please> [/] peas please . 566640_573340
*PAR0:	oh did you make that sound . 573340_578780
*PAR0:	it's interesting to me that she is sitting and kind of playing because at home now since she's learning to stand and cruise around furniture and pull up and everything . 578780_594460
*PAR0:	she will play with almost anything but her own toys right now . 594460_599280
*PAR0:	you know I mean I'll put out a bunch of stuff for her . 599280_602060
*PAR0:	and she'll crawl right over it to get to the plug coming out of the wall or to pull up on the couch . 602060_608160
*PAR0:	and then let go you know and I have gotta be [/] be right there yesterday she crawled into the fireplace . 608160_612820
*PAR0:	&-um yeah you got into the soot in about two seconds . 612820_618000
*PAR0:	you were like over there . 618000_620580
*PAR0:	so now we have to block it . 620580_623160
*PAR0:	whereas before she wouldn't even have gone for it because she would have just not really cared . 623160_628540
*PAR0:	so this is interesting . 628540_630000
*PAR0:	just that you know she's got new stuff she is going for . 630000_634080
*PAR0:	but she's not really going for the stuff that she . 634420_636620
*PAR0:	has at home like books . 636620_638020
*PAR0:	and so that's kind of interesting . 638020_640860
*PAR0:	isn't it . 640860_641720
*PAR0:	yeah . 642420_642440
*PAR0:	well I think that answers my question . 644280_647300
*PAR0:	did you happen to &-uh schedule your &-uh . 647920_651980
*PAR0:	no . 653620_653980
