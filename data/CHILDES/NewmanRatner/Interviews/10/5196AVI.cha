*PAR0:	so I don't remember her going for the spoons like this . 55200_59020
*PAR0:	but I just found it funny . 59020_60560
*PAR0:	she was like everything was a food item . 60560_62380
*PAR0:	that's why I kept going . 63240_65060
*PAR0:	is she hungry . 65060_65720
*PAR0:	are you trying to tell me something . 66160_67500
*PAR0:	do you think she recognizes any of them as being . 67880_71620
*PAR0:	I mean I think she understands the bottle and the cup . 72720_74840
*PAR0:	I mean like she's moving to a sippy cup . 75320_78060
*PAR0:	now she sees's a bottle . 78060_79700
*PAR0:	so she uses a bottle . 79700_81500

*PAR0:	so we have other types of pasta but not spaghetti . 120700_124080
*PAR0:	so I just found it funny . 124080_125240
*PAR0:	she's just sitting there like going after it . 125240_127520
*PAR0:	now it could be it's just red . 127520_129040

*PAR0:	but she sort of went around other things . 131360_135040
*PAR0:	I'm not sure what mean the waffles . 135040_137880
*PAR0:	I know she'd note those because we have waffles around the house . 137880_141140
*PAR0:	&-um so she might recognize that the bottles <and the> [/] and the sippy but maybe the pizza . 141140_148220

*PAR0:	she was going for the spoons I mean she knows what's I think she knows what spoons are for . 181680_186020
*PAR0:	but she usually doesn't she doesn't start feeding trying to feed herself as far as we know . 186020_191340

*PAR0:	we have Dr Seuss Books but in different versions the Peekaboo baby we don't have she has a big version of Pat the bunny that has animals . 405440_422240
*PAR0:	so like a [/] a big tall version of that . 422240_425340
*PAR0:	so she'll go over and pat that &-um much more fun to pat the animals when they're big that one's a little bit bigger . 425660_434440

*PAR0:	do you think she'd recognize that particular . 444800_446260
*PAR0:	no [/] no like our goodnight Moon is the traditional color does the book . 446580_451020
*PAR0:	so she [/] she wouldn't recognize that . 451060_453440
*PAR0:	&-um hi [/] hi what now you said last time that among the animals she'd been interested in [/] in poo because of the red and the eagle . 454240_487420
*PAR0:	&-um and then she the those were the animals . 488760_495120
*PAR0:	and then she was interested sort . 495260_496440
*PAR0:	of as I said the spam and the &-um the pizza . 496440_499840
*PAR0:	where are you going . 500700_502180
*PAR0:	oh no we don't pick up [/] up . 502720_506060

*PAR0:	&-um yeah what . 512080_516580
*PAR0:	yeah I don't remember being into any . 517480_520180
*PAR0:	I think she might have looked at Bee a little bit but not much . 520180_523360
*PAR0:	but she was more attracted to the red stuff . 523360_526600
*PAR0:	yeah . 526600_526760
*PAR0:	sometimes it's getting kind of spotted [/] spotted . 526760_530300
*PAR0:	yeah spotted . 530300_530840
*PAR0:	but &-uh typically this one ends up being a winner with younger because it's got this weird . 530840_537720
*PAR0:	yeah oh white &-um slightly purple the [/] the red . 537720_549360
*PAR0:	yeah . 549360_549680
*PAR0:	because otherwise I could see her totally avoiding the black and white or more like because it's fuzzy . 549680_557760
*PAR0:	yeah I think it was totally the hat . 557760_561320
*PAR0:	yeah because yeah most of you guys are just kind of brown . 561320_566480
*PAR0:	and yeah she's always been attracted to bright items . 566480_570340
*PAR0:	I wasn't surprised when she picked that up . 570340_572140
*PAR0:	but then I was surprised that she just kept going at food items . 572140_575620
*PAR0:	and like I remember she picked this up before and kind of looked at that again . 575620_581800
*PAR0:	the red does this kind of . 581800_584500
*PAR0:	so this doesn't quite mirror what you played . 584500_586120
*PAR0:	no [/] no [/] no not at all . 586120_589240
*PAR0:	I don't know . 589240_590160
*PAR0:	I mean she has a pair of keys that she plays with . 590160_595900
*PAR0:	we have like one of those &-um actually like two generations of the sort of workman table little tables from like the Fisher Price tables . 595900_606700
*PAR0:	the buttons . 606700_607760
*PAR0:	oh okay . 607760_608080
*PAR0:	so there's one version that the older version is the non sound version . 608080_612340
*PAR0:	so it kind of you push the [/] the why you push the little spinning wheels and things like that . 612340_619320
*PAR0:	in the newer version you kind of . 619320_621200
*PAR0:	move it like that . 621200_622320
