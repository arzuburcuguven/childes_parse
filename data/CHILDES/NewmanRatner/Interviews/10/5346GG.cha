*PAR0:	and you know was kissing it and stuff which I haven't seen her do . 68060_71420

*PAR0:	and &-um you know isn't picky about her food or anything like that either . 100020_105500
*PAR0:	what about this one . 107220_108500
*PAR0:	she seemed to like . 108500_109340
*PAR0:	yeah she picks it up . 109740_111000
*PAR0:	I don't know . 111000_111500
*PAR0:	&-um I think the colors are interesting . 112040_114900
*PAR0:	it looks like probably it's broken . 115140_116280
*PAR0:	so I didn't know exactly how to play with it with her . 116280_118360
*PAR0:	so I was kind of like . 118360_119260
*PAR0:	well it looks like there were probably hands there at one point . 119260_123140
*PAR0:	what do you think about that . 123140_125000
*PAR0:	huh . 125000_126140

*PAR0:	yeah . 136400_137260
*PAR0:	&-um yeah I just didn't really know what to how to interact with her with it . 137800_143180
*PAR0:	yes . 143280_143600
*PAR0:	can I ask you a question . 144140_145900
*PAR0:	&-um what about the other kids &-um have kids were other kids been out there too . 146420_152560
*PAR0:	have she had . 152980_154360
*PAR0:	no . 154540_155060
*PAR0:	oh gosh . 155640_156420
*PAR0:	I mean &-um let me think she's what do I usually make . 156580_162300
*PAR0:	&-um last night she had for example roasted vegetables and chicken sausages and garlic risotto . 162300_168040
*PAR0:	so like she really is kind of whatever I really like to cook . 168040_173100
*PAR0:	and &-um I made all her baby food . 173100_175960
*PAR0:	did her sisters too like all the purees and stuff . 176080_178040
*PAR0:	and it was always important to me . 178140_179580
*PAR0:	to get them to eat really healthy and a lot of variety of stuff in terms of this . 179580_183220
*PAR0:	like she's had she just recently has had ice cream cones . 183220_185820
*PAR0:	and it's funny because she did exactly what she did with her real ice cream cone . 185920_189440
*PAR0:	which is she always bites off the [/] the bottom [/] bottom which [/] which turns [/] turns out [/] out to [/] to be [/] be a [/] a huge [/] huge mess [/] mess . 189440_192220
*PAR0:	and but she [/] she always [/] always flips [/] flips it [/] it right [/] right upside [/] upside down [/] down . 192640_194660
*PAR0:	and [/] and bites [/] bites off [/] off the bottom . 194660_195660
*PAR0:	she hasn't had peanut butter due to allergy reasons . 195720_198720
*PAR0:	&-um and her sister doesn't eat a lot of peanut butter . 199620_202540
*PAR0:	so I don't think she probably identified with that . 202540_205120
*PAR0:	but maybe with the spaghetti she loves anything with red sauce on it . 205260_208180
*PAR0:	okay . 209040_209440
*PAR0:	what's that . 210720_211240
*PAR0:	can you pick this out . 211260_212540
*PAR0:	yeah . 213880_214540
*PAR0:	she has waffles too at home for breakfast . 214540_216720
*PAR0:	&-um I always make em a hot breakfast . 217440_219840
*PAR0:	so she either has waffles or French toast or eggs . 219980_223240
*PAR0:	&-um and then usually fruit with it too or yogurt . 223800_226940
*PAR0:	okay . 227360_227640
*PAR0:	and are you playing with her . 227940_229420
*PAR0:	&-uh does she think she might find you both inside . 229640_232240
*PAR0:	&-um she probably doesn't have juice . 232760_234320
*PAR0:	she doesn't have juice yet . 234320_235480
*PAR0:	she just has water &-um and formula . 235480_238040
*PAR0:	but &-uh she [/] she drinks out of a sippy cup . 238040_241040
*PAR0:	she knows what that is like . 241780_242900
*PAR0:	when I was doing that . 242900_243740
*PAR0:	and she was pretending to drink . 243740_245480
*PAR0:	she'll pick up a cup herself and drink it at home . 245580_247640
*PAR0:	&-um and the bottle she definitely I [/] I think you know had some stuff in that too the her stuff and . 248420_253740
*PAR0:	stuff like that . 253740_254720
*PAR0:	&-um yeah &-um you know among us class has been everything especially with you pencil when you were &-uh huh . 255060_263240
*PAR0:	and &-um feeding the baby . 263320_265020
*PAR0:	does she use any pencil now or when does she start giving . 265360_267560
*PAR0:	she doesn't she's actually gone through a phase where &-um anything that I try to feed her like from a spoon . 267740_273280
*PAR0:	she won't really eat . 273280_274700
*PAR0:	she has to feed herself . 275000_275860
*PAR0:	she's going through this independence thing . 276100_277860
*PAR0:	so &-um I'll give her a spoon to play with sometimes . 277980_280500
*PAR0:	but anything like with a spoon is a [/] a huge mess . 280760_283880
*PAR0:	so usually she just picks up food with her hands . 283920_286420
*PAR0:	&-um but she sees us eat at home with &-uh you know our utensils . 286680_290680
*PAR0:	&-um she mostly likes to play with them and bang them like she did . 290980_295820
*PAR0:	&-um so I'm just gonna <thank you> [/] thank you . 296200_300620
*PAR0:	they're gonna have actually shoes . 300880_302400
*PAR0:	yeah they will . 302580_303460
*PAR0:	okay . 304280_304940
*PAR0:	&-um again with the stuff on the wall . 304940_307600
*PAR0:	how can she more like a toy &-um the exact animals or . 307600_313060
*PAR0:	okay . 313060_313400
*PAR0:	the exact ones we have that [/] that otter . 313400_315780
*PAR0:	&-um I think that's the only one . 315780_317800
*PAR0:	but we have other similar like we have a zebra . 317800_319640
*PAR0:	we have a frog . 319640_321500
*PAR0:	&-um yes there you go . 321500_327080
*PAR0:	&-um we have a seal . 327080_329220
*PAR0:	we have a lot of them . 329220_331400
*PAR0:	but I'm glad her sister's in here because she's had a big temper tantrum about taking them home . 331400_336480
*PAR0:	that's like she just loves these like little size animals like that right now . 336620_339680
*PAR0:	I don't know why . 339760_340260
*PAR0:	&-um but like I said I don't know if she's not that interested in them just because of that stage I . 340740_345800
*PAR0:	know her older sister wasn't that interested in them at this stage or if it's because like every time she touches them she gets them like ripped out of her hand . 345800_352880
*PAR0:	so it could be that as well . 352880_355460
*PAR0:	is that a yummy book . 355460_356500
*PAR0:	how about books . 356500_357220
*PAR0:	do you read to her at home . 357220_358400
*PAR0:	mhm . 358400_358860
*PAR0:	yeah we do usually sometimes when she wakes up in the morning she gets a couple of she's feeling a little bit fussy . 358860_363480
*PAR0:	but always at her nap times and bedtimes we do like four or five books . 363480_366820
*PAR0:	then I usually just keep a big basket in their play space . 367440_370020
*PAR0:	and [/] and they read them throughout the day . 370440_372180
*PAR0:	and she'll just kinda go through them . 372280_373800
*PAR0:	but I actually read them too or at night and during nap time . 373860_376300
*PAR0:	and you use books at home . 376680_378360
*PAR0:	&-um we have similar books to these the caring Cats books . 379140_382680
*PAR0:	and we have a good night moon book . 382760_385340
*PAR0:	&-um we have a couple books that have farm animals in them . 385340_387920
*PAR0:	and you probably heard she started making some of the farm noises . 387920_390480
*PAR0:	&-um <she's seen> [/] she's seen all these animals in here . 390480_395940
*PAR0:	she really just does the &-um the sheep and the cow . 395940_399520
*PAR0:	at this point . 399520_400860
*PAR0:	she'll also do a snake . 400860_402480
*PAR0:	you guys didn't have a snake . 402980_404220
*PAR0:	but she'll hiss like a snake . 404420_405560
*PAR0:	&-um okay . 407480_411920
