*PAR0:	he's not quite to the point where he moves his animals around . 110540_113080
*PAR0:	so like animals are there for cuddling and for bedtime and stuff like that . 113260_117700
*PAR0:	but he doesn't really play with them a whole lot . 117700_119640
*PAR0:	so &-um have there been any changes since last visit in terms of . 119640_125540
*PAR0:	their toys . 125540_126020
*PAR0:	and he's always pretty into the food actually and the books . 126020_131240
*PAR0:	so <I think it's> [/] I think it's about the same . 131820_133460
*PAR0:	he's a little more like the puppet is like way exciting now . 133920_137020
*PAR0:	whereas last time it was not at all . 137020_139280
*PAR0:	so I think that would be the only change I can think of . 139420_142620
*PAR0:	is there any food that he was most interested in . 143620_146680
*PAR0:	he likes the pizza . 147000_147980
*PAR0:	I think <I didn't> [/] I didn't really pull like it was what he could reach right because he wouldn't get off my lap . 148100_154220
*PAR0:	&-um but it's also something that he recognizes . 154220_157980
*PAR0:	and that he likes like he likes to help make pizza because he eats more cheese than he actually goes on it . 157980_164640

*PAR0:	we don't have the counting one . 178900_180020
*PAR0:	think that's why he was kind of like what is going on with this book . 180020_183280
*PAR0:	but he does like Peekaboo type books . 183280_187140
