*MOT:	you figure out the story and I'll do the writing (be)cause I know you hate the writing .
@Comment:	Time is 0:17
@Comment:	MOT suggests that Chi works out the story and she write the letter because she knows Chi hates writing. EXP expresses that the Chi should do the writing but Mot can help. Chi is obviously unhappy about having to do this task. Chi doesn't know what to write to authors and doesn't like the book. Mot helps by asking questions about the book , trying to find something about it that Chi likes. The letter is written with a fair amount of grumbling from Chi. At times , Chi becomes frustrated and angry , sometimes directing this at Mot. Mot is patient with Chi.
