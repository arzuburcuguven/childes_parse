@Activities:	Mealtime

@Types:	long, meal, TD
*FAT:	there you are .
@Comment:	Time is 0:06. Probably referring to turning on the tape recorder
@Comment:	The meal lasts for 19:10. They discuss various issues , including Sis's desire to get contact lenses , different friends of the family and Sis , and driving directions to a place Sis needs to drive. The conversation seems dominated by Sis's needs and interests. This tape is somewhat of a curiosity , as family hadn't returned any of the previous 4 tapes , and I thought I knew why. In the HV7 interview , MOT says parents speak Spanish at home (and kids respond in English mostly)
