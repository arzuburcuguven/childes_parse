*PAR0:	so I can ask you some questions now . 4920_6680
*PAR0:	alrighty . 6680_7360
*PAR0:	yeah that was impressive . 7360_9480
*PAR0:	say yeah . 9480_10220
*PAR0:	did a good job . 10220_11220
*PAR0:	you didn't even care about the camera this time . 11220_12940
*PAR0:	last time I did it seem like he was more interested in any toys this time than last time . 12940_46020
*PAR0:	didn't care about these <last time> [/] last time . 46020_48620
*PAR0:	he loved the baby doll which was new . 48620_51640
*PAR0:	he's always liked like the play food . 51640_54440
*PAR0:	but he'd never played with these before . 54440_57240
*PAR0:	usually it was the pasta . 57240_58680
*PAR0:	okay . 58680_59040
*PAR0:	and it's kind of a weird question which do you think is a good toy for his personality . 60460_64640
*PAR0:	&-um you know I [/] I think these turned into blocks for him . 65200_72100
*PAR0:	which we have a couple blocks at home . 72180_73680
*PAR0:	which he loves to [/] to knock down for us . 73680_77580
*PAR0:	but they're soft . 77800_78740
*PAR0:	so he's never been able to build them . 78740_79900
*PAR0:	but I think these were because he works really hard at like you can tell there's certain toys that he really concentrates on at home . 79900_87980
*PAR0:	&-um and so I think turning these into blocks is lets him kind of concentrate on it . 87980_97760
*PAR0:	okay . 97760_98060
*PAR0:	&-um which do you think he was interested in . 98060_102820
*PAR0:	the least he doesn't stuffed animals . 102820_105920
*PAR0:	he hasn't really &-um all three times . 105920_109360
*PAR0:	so yeah consistently yeah not really . 109900_112680
*PAR0:	and I've tried before to see if he wanted to play like I tried the puppet last time . 112920_118860
*PAR0:	and he didn't really . 118860_121200
*PAR0:	okay . 121200_122260
*PAR0:	&-um did he like look at any books or do you have any of his books at home . 122260_127780
*PAR0:	&-um we don't have this specific book but we have one that's just like it . 127780_131340
*PAR0:	it just has different animals . 131340_132720
*PAR0:	it's a different one barely though it's the same animals . 132720_136620
