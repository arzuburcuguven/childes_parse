@Comment:	Chi jumps right into writing the letter , without re-reading the book. While he is writing the header of the letter , MOT and EXP talk about other things. Chi must take some time to think about the content of the letter , because at one point Mot becomes impatient and prods Chi to hurry the writing the process. When Chi asks for help on his spelling , MOT reacts impatiently and half-jokes that she is the one who will end up writing the letter. Mot seems to relax after that , however , and Chi finishes up his one-sentence letter , while EXP and she continue to talk. Chi reads his finished product , which leads into a discussion on books he likes to read. Mot and Chi seem to have a good relationship overall , and Chi seems like a very good-natured child.
