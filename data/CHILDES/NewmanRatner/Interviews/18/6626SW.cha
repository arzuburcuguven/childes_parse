*PAR0:	sure . 4660_10760
*PAR0:	eat all the fake food . 10760_13340
*PAR0:	I think we need to feed her . 13340_17500
*PAR0:	she played mostly with the food and the baby . 17500_24400
*PAR0:	&-um she I think probably put most of the food in her mouth . 25060_30360
*PAR0:	so that was a lot of it . 30880_32800
*PAR0:	&-um played with the books a little bit but not as much as I think probably the last few times . 32920_37960
*PAR0:	what did she do last time . 38280_39700
*PAR0:	&-um she [/] she goes through phases where she's just like really into books . 39800_44640
*PAR0:	&-um so she does a lot of like flipping through and reading on her own . 44640_48820
*PAR0:	&-um so I I'm pretty sure the last time we were here she was into that . 48920_52340
*PAR0:	&-um and then probably one of the first times she played more with the soft toys . 52880_56920
*PAR0:	so she [/] she played with them a little bit but not much like unless I prompted her . 57120_61380
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah this was most of it . 61380_64860
*PAR0:	yeah . 64860_65560
*PAR0:	checking out all the food and eating it . 65560_68040
*PAR0:	and just &-um probably in the last month or two she's gotten into like feeding dolls or kind of mimicking us I guess taking care of them . 68040_77700
*PAR0:	so that was probably most of it . 79300_80560
*PAR0:	&-um and she didn't pay as much attention to the clock this time . 80800_84980
*PAR0:	like one or two times ago . 85480_86600
*PAR0:	she was very busy with like moving the hands around . 86600_89880
*PAR0:	so [/] so it was pretty similar to other times . 90240_93460
*PAR0:	kind of what she's been doing . 93460_94820
*PAR0:	yeah I mean she seems to have a favorite every time this time . 94860_98780
*PAR0:	it was the food . 98780_99640
*PAR0:	yeah . 100100_100500

*PAR0:	&-um she does have tons of books . 105080_107940
*PAR0:	and she has baby dolls . 108040_109080
*PAR0:	and she has lots of stuffed animals . 109180_110340
*PAR0:	so that could be why she's more interested in it . 110420_112500
*PAR0:	but yeah one's tacos . 112700_114720
*PAR0:	I can't open it . 116340_118160

*PAR0:	and she likes to take shoes off . 154020_155780
*PAR0:	don't know if it's just because it's easier . 156140_157360
*PAR0:	but yeah she wasn't too into that . 157360_161700
