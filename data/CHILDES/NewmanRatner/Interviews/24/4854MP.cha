*PAR0:	it always is with us . 505700_506800
*PAR0:	&-uh huh &-um I have two more permission slips to do . 507080_514220
*PAR0:	okay . 514400_514600
*PAR0:	and I'm let tell me you why I've got them here . 515240_519480
*PAR0:	okay . 519480_519920
*PAR0:	the first one is we have the first one we've been coming in . 520140_524580
*PAR0:	and &-um we've been recording her . 525100_527380
*PAR0:	so we've got her since she was seven months which is you know a big change . 527380_531140
*PAR0:	it's fun to see the tapes . 531280_532400
*PAR0:	mhm . 532720_532860
*PAR0:	&-um but we've also been taping you . 532860_534540
*PAR0:	oh okay . 534900_535380
*PAR0:	and . 535500_535560
*PAR0:	we talk about this at the end and not at the beginning because people start to talk differently . 535560_538960
*PAR0:	but one of the things they're looking at is how parents make their speech real clear for them . 539220_542760
*PAR0:	children who are learning words . 542760_543880
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 544100_544300
*PAR0:	and we're curious about when they start to do it . 544440_546720
*PAR0:	you know you do it with a seven month old who is not gonna say zebra . 546960_549700
*PAR0:	mhm . 550060_550440
*PAR0:	or [/] or not . 550640_552720
*PAR0:	and then when they're when you did those about year visit when they're starting to maybe have a chance at a word . 552800_557140
*PAR0:	mm not Zebra maybe ball . 557140_558960
*PAR0:	but &-um so we're looking at that . 558960_561440
*PAR0:	and we're finding that people make their vowels real long . 561440_563820
*PAR0:	&-uh and they'll say the ends of the words real nicely . 563820_566200
*PAR0:	you know they say cat . 566200_567140
*PAR0:	mhm with a yes . 567140_569100
*PAR0:	when they're saying him so that a child can learn him . 569100_571380
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 571380_571840
*PAR0:	and so we would love to be able to look at that and for that we need your consent . 571840_574640
*PAR0:	okay . 574880_575120
*PAR0:	and then consent form number two . 575660_578540
*PAR0:	mhm . 578800_579060
*PAR0:	is to ask for &-um permission for a couple different things . 579740_584780
*PAR0:	we &-um we've already signed consent forms for us a zillion times . 584860_588340
*PAR0:	mhm . 588480_588660
*PAR0:	for [/] for this study . 588740_589420
*PAR0:	but we'd also like to be able to they're working on a new child [/] child language [/] language database . 589740_593020
*PAR0:	okay . 593020_593580
*PAR0:	there's been one for a while . 593580_594700
*PAR0:	but it's real clunky . 594700_595460
*PAR0:	it's old . 595460_596060
*PAR0:	it's hard to search for certain things . 596060_597520
*PAR0:	okay . 597520_597960
*PAR0:	and &-um we'd like to be able to use them in that . 597960_600740
