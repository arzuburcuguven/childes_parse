@Comment:	The interaction between Mot and Chi is very limited. Mot mostly watches Chi who plays silently. There is almost no dialogue and there is no real science talk. Video tape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
*INV:	that (.) &-um like some we asked you to play with +...
*INV:	www .
%sit:	explains that they are to play together and that the activity will be videotaped

*INV:	(o)kay ?
*MOT:	(..) what's gonna be ?
%int:	whispered
*MOT:	(..) strong magnet .
%com:	videotape starts here
