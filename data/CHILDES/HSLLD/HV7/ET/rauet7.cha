@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	18-JUL-1995
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	you two can do this together .
@Comment:	Time is 19:55. Chi and Mot are seated at corners of a table; magnets are on the table between them; the black base is full of objects
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play together during the activity. Chi frequently becomes interested in an object the moment Mot picks it up and repeatedly takes things from her. There is little science talk during the activity , mostly consisting of discovering which objects are magnetic and which ones are not. The majority of the time is spent playing a game to see who can get his/her magnet to collect more of the objects that are on the table.
*MOT:	can do together .
