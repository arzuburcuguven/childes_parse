@Comment:	The letter writing task is preceded by Chi reading the book to EXP. He has some trouble with this. EXP helps Chi by telling him to use the pictures to figure out the words , and by helping him sound words out. Mot helps a little with the letter writing. She comments on punctuation and reminds Chi how to spell his last name. After he has finished , Chi asks if he can draw a picture.
