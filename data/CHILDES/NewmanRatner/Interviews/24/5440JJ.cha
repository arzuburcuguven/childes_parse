*PAR0:	oh okay . 190820_191240
*PAR0:	yeah that's a lot of them will do that . 191560_192980

*PAR0:	yeah there was a bottle here . 193840_195200
*PAR0:	I don't know where it went . 195420_196100
*PAR0:	but a lot of times they'll give him food or I think I saw her trying to . 196460_200020

*PAR0:	&-uh she's seen animals and books and a couple of zoos and stuff . 211620_217660
*PAR0:	but we don't have exactly like that . 217660_219560
*PAR0:	I think we've got like one of the ones we looked at . 219560_249120
*PAR0:	I mean I guess she hasn't seen a moose . 249560_252660
*PAR0:	one of the petting farms we've gone to has an Emu oh really . 252660_259140
*PAR0:	yeah . 259140_259640
*PAR0:	&-um I think she's seen lemurs at a zoo . 259640_266420
*PAR0:	and she's probably seen an octopus . 266420_268620
*PAR0:	but I don't know that she would recognize them . 268620_271860
*PAR0:	yeah . 271860_271940
*PAR0:	&-uh she's seen a barracuda in finding Nemo yeah [/] yeah a lot of movies have weirder and weirder animals like I feel like when I first saw them I thought . 273260_284160
*PAR0:	oh she's probably gonna be what is this you know . 284160_286680
*PAR0:	but some of them I [/] I guess they've seen . 286740_289600
*PAR0:	and she's seen snakes before . 290240_291440
*PAR0:	so maybe that's what she thought that was . 291440_293300
*PAR0:	yeah probably did she &-um was there anything that she didn't seem to like at all or be interested in . 294080_300820
*PAR0:	she didn't really go for the animals . 302160_306920
*PAR0:	but I that was more that she was already invested with the food by the time the animals came out . 306920_312780
*PAR0:	yeah . 312960_313280
*PAR0:	and she never I [/] I are those magnets or puzzle pieces or something . 313840_319440
*PAR0:	I think it's like . 319800_320840
*PAR0:	yeah like some different scenes with some more animals . 320840_322740
*PAR0:	yeah I don't think she [/] she didn't seem to be interested in the book at all . 323980_328660
*PAR0:	she probably didn't even see it . 329180_330100
*PAR0:	no . 330260_330540
*PAR0:	do you have any books at home . 331340_332400
*PAR0:	like in particular that she likes right now . 332400_336980
*PAR0:	she likes one that has Cookie monster on it but . 336980_338860
*PAR0:	she can cookie . 338860_339580
*PAR0:	does she like to read with you at home . 340680_342860
*PAR0:	we don't do as much as we should . 343160_345240
*PAR0:	&-um well I mean I don't think there's like a some kids just are more drawn to books or some kids are more drawn . 345240_350660
*PAR0:	Tp doing the kind of imaginative play . 350660_353500
*PAR0:	she [/] she likes books certainly more than Aj has in terms of sitting down and reading them . 353800_358820
*PAR0:	and she'll pull one out and read it herself a lot . 358920_361680
*PAR0:	mhm . 362020_362700
*PAR0:	&-uh and sometimes we'll go through them . 362820_364560
*PAR0:	but most [/] most of the ones she likes right now . 364680_366320
*PAR0:	are you know counting or shapes or board books . 366320_369540
*PAR0:	not much to them . 369540_371100
*PAR0:	well that's good though . 371320_372680
*PAR0:	did she like them at the other sessions because I know there's this is all different from the other stuff we have . 372760_379260
*PAR0:	I think she's mostly focused on the food every time we've been here maybe because of the novelty . 379520_383920
*PAR0:	yeah . 383920_384940
*PAR0:	if she's never seen it before I mean occasionally she'll I'll try get her attention with a doll or a book or something . 384940_391820
*PAR0:	and she not really interested . 391820_393960
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah well especially if the ones that she hadn't seen before she probably was more interested like I know a lot of kids wonder what the tuna is . 393960_401760
*PAR0:	it just looks gross . 401760_402600
*PAR0:	and then some of the other stuff is just kinda they like . 403280_406540
*PAR0:	and then they make up their own name . 406540_407620
*PAR0:	like I think she was calling everything juice . 407700_409080
*PAR0:	and then she was saying for the peach . 409160_411480
*PAR0:	what was she calling it . 411480_412180
*PAR0:	&-um an apple sometimes . 412180_413740
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah they kinda just over generalize but it's [/] it's good you know I think do . 414080_419400
*PAR0:	you think she's seen you eat any of these things at home . 419400_422920
*PAR0:	we definitely had peaches . 422920_423900
*PAR0:	and she's seen people eat green beans and hamburgers and cupcakes . 423900_430260
*PAR0:	and yeah . 430260_431500
*PAR0:	and there have been beets in our home . 431500_433680
*PAR0:	but oh yeah we don't eat them frequently . 433680_435860
*PAR0:	that's for sure . 435860_436780
*PAR0:	&-uh I don't think we've even had a Kiwi in the house . 436780_440540
*PAR0:	so I don't know where she'd see that . 440540_443660
*PAR0:	she seems to like &-uh naming though like she knows a lot of vocabulary she likes to repeat . 443660_450080
*PAR0:	so that's good . 450080_450680
*PAR0:	I f I feel like she'll probably pick up a lot of these words really easily . 450800_454500
*PAR0:	yeah I think she just was a little shy at first . 455020_457220
*PAR0:	so she was having a hard [/] hard time . 457560_458740
*PAR0:	but once [/] once she got more comfortable she was just kind of . 458740_461880
*PAR0:	yeah . 462240_462300
*PAR0:	but I think you know that's [/] that's sort of what happens every time . 462580_465360
*PAR0:	they're not you know they're like . 465520_467100
*PAR0:	who are you why do you keep showing me these things . 467100_469000
*PAR0:	they get a little shy . 469000_469880
*PAR0:	but once they loosen up they like you know they like to name everything . 469880_473460
*PAR0:	so &-um so is there anything that she plays with at home that we haven't seen here . 474500_481960
*PAR0:	Aj has a train set Thomas and so we do a lot of trains putting trains together and taking them apart . 481960_492320
*PAR0:	and she does that some more taking apart than putting together . 492320_496460
*PAR0:	but &-uh and then duplos and some Lincoln logs . 496480_502480
*PAR0:	she doesn't really do much construction with them yet . 502480_504780
*PAR0:	but she does play with them . 504780_505900
*PAR0:	she likes she's got a stacking toy or two &-um what else beads . 505900_513940
*PAR0:	she really likes beads . 513940_514860
*PAR0:	she seemed to like those . 515940_517220
*PAR0:	they're hard but they really get focused . 517220_520420
*PAR0:	on you know well . 520420_521780
*PAR0:	and I I'm talking about the [/] the beads . 521780_523940
*PAR0:	oh the big ones . 523940_524640
*PAR0:	yeah the big things . 524640_525560
*PAR0:	yeah . 525560_525840
*PAR0:	those are easier for the wood . 525840_526960
*PAR0:	<she didn't> [/] she didn't seem to like to build with the blocks here as much . 526960_533280
*PAR0:	but I think you know they're kind of hard because they're like legos or something . 533280_536860
*PAR0:	usually easier . 536860_538480
*PAR0:	a lot of kids they get you know three or four . 538480_540840
*PAR0:	and they start to fall down . 540840_541780
*PAR0:	so . 541780_541940
*PAR0:	okay that's [/] that's enough . 541940_543440
*PAR0:	but she likes knocking things over . 543440_546340
*PAR0:	yeah I feel like that's a lot of them do . 546340_549220
*PAR0:	let's build a tower . 549220_550680
*PAR0:	they just want to hit it every time was this typical play for her . 550680_558880
*PAR0:	yeah there's a lot of showing and &-uh what's this . 558880_564060
*PAR0:	and but she's [/] she's better at just playing on her own than Aj has been . 564060_572080
*PAR0:	so you can't just leave her and let her play for a little while . 573000_576760
*PAR0:	and she's alright most of the time like play with her dolls and stuff by herself . 576760_580700
*PAR0:	yeah well she'll destroy things . 580700_583420
*PAR0:	yeah . 583420_584960
*PAR0:	do they ever play together in you know some &-uh they're not great at that yet . 584960_590920
*PAR0:	but we're working on sharing and you know what's mine and what's not my yours . 590920_594780
*PAR0:	and yeah how [/] how much older is he just a couple years &-uh almost exactly two . 594780_600020
*PAR0:	oh okay . 600320_600700
*PAR0:	yeah . 600940_601060
*PAR0:	oh and then you're having another baby . 601220_602520
*PAR0:	so yeah two and two . 602520_603440
*PAR0:	yeah just about they're [/] they're like a week and a half from being two years apart . 603600_607860
*PAR0:	and this one's a couple months later than that . 607860_609620
*PAR0:	but oh that's cool . 609620_611100
*PAR0:	that'll be really fun . 611160_611880
*PAR0:	yeah . 612020_612140
*PAR0:	&-um is there anything you wanted to ask me or anything else you . 612940_617040
*PAR0:	wanted to let me know . 617040_617840
*PAR0:	no . 618280_618740
*PAR0:	alright . 619680_619780
*PAR0:	they'll be coming back . 620480_621500
*PAR0:	sorry . 621500_621740
*PAR0:	yeah no [/] no [/] no that's okay . 621820_622740
*PAR0:	&-um I do have two more consents for you . 623040_626260
*PAR0:	I know we have a million consents . 626420_627760
*PAR0:	&-um we actually this whole time that we've been looking at &-um her speech we've also been looking at your speech as well . 627780_636060
*PAR0:	because we we're trying to see we know that mothers talk a little differently to their babies kind of tend to stress their vowels a little more like you know &-um to try to help their you know the kids learn it better . 636060_647900
*PAR0:	but we're interested in seeing kind of how your speech changes as they develop like a child who's maybe you know like eight months they can't really repeat certain things . 647960_657220
*PAR0:	but maybe you change based on if they you know if they're a little older . 657220_660260
*PAR0:	do you [/] you know what I'm saying like it's kind . 660260_661980
*PAR0:	we're trying we're not sure &-um how mothers change their speech at different points in development . 661980_666120
*PAR0:	so we're interested in &-um at that . 666120_668660
*PAR0:	so this first consent would be if you would allow us to look at your speech . 668660_673280
*PAR0:	it would be for this research study and then the other consent . 673280_679200
*PAR0:	so this one this is the first one here . 679200_682000
*PAR0:	and then the other one I think it's on the back . 682000_685400
*PAR0:	we right now're trying to compile like a digital audio database of &-um of children's speech . 685400_692520
*PAR0:	so in the past they've had &-um just mostly transcripts of speech . 693080_697080
*PAR0:	so they're great . 697220_698360
*PAR0:	but you can only look at certain things . 698360_699760
*PAR0:	whatever they transcribe you can't actually hear it . 699800_701820
*PAR0:	and so if you're trying to look at other things . 702080_703500
*PAR0:	and they . 703500_703680
*PAR0:	didn't care to mark it down . 703680_706020
*PAR0:	then you're not gonna be able to see it . 706020_707020
*PAR0:	so they're trying to compile an actual audio database to use to analyze speech . 707020_712120
*PAR0:	and so &-um the other consent would be if you would let us look at &-um &-uh use that . 712120_717480
*PAR0:	&-um there's a couple different options . 717480_719960
*PAR0:	&-um one is just to use . 719960_721460
*PAR0:	I think it's on the back . 721460_722940
*PAR0:	one is to use . 724180_725620
*PAR0:	I think one is not to use it just to allow us for the study . 725620_729140
*PAR0:	one's to use just a transcript . 729140_731000
*PAR0:	and everything's completely anonymous . 731000_733080
*PAR0:	they &-um they take out your name &-um any if you said like you know your dog's name or where you live . 733080_738760
*PAR0:	anything is it's completely anonymous . 738760_740040
*PAR0:	so it would be just a transcript though . 740040_742200
*PAR0:	&-um and then the other option would be if you would have us use actual audio because it's only as good as you know what they wrote . 742200_750040
*PAR0:	and it once it gets put into the database all your demographic information is taken away . 750040_755740
*PAR0:	so even if we wanted to look for it later we wouldn't be able to find it right . 755740_758680
*PAR0:	but it's just kind of to help you know with future research . 758680_762600
*PAR0:	so it's very interesting stuff . 762600_764400
