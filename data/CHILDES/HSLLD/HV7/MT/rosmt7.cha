*FAT:	here we are .
@Comment:	Time is 0:05
@Comment:	This is a pretty lively mealtime , featuring some extremely crunchy food. All three participants have conversation with each other , but most involves Chi with either Fat or Mot. Conversation is slow getting started (food and more food) but takes off when talking about the school musical (Chi is dancing) and the cinema career of Mr Johnny Depp. So there's a wide range of topics and full participation from Chi. Mot not very talkative , not feeling well from the meal.
