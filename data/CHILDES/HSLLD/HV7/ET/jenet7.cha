@Comment:	Time is 27:19. Videotape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
@Comment:	Chi plays with the objects by herself for the most part. Mot rarely touches any of them but she does watch what Chi is doing and offers suggestions. New activities are begun by Chi. Science talk is limited , although Mot does attempt to explain to Chi why objects are behaving a certain way by using the word current. Chi's younger brother Bro is seated on Mot's lap and occasionally his babbling overpowers the talk.
