*PAR0:	I was just trying to get her to learn to move &-uh move the hands . 30560_35820
*PAR0:	and I don't think she's seen a clock before . 35820_39580
*PAR0:	so I was also trying to teach her what it was . 39580_42680
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah a lot of these toys we have similar things at home . 42680_47860
*PAR0:	but she doesn't have a clock . 47860_49060
*PAR0:	and she doesn't have these like food items . 49060_51800
*PAR0:	how did she play with the food items . 52320_54480
*PAR0:	&-um most of them she's picking up and then throwing them . 54960_57420
*PAR0:	&-um she did try to eat some of them like the peas . 57800_60820
*PAR0:	we feed her peas a lot . 60820_62520
*PAR0:	and she uses them as finger food . 62520_64020
*PAR0:	so she kept trying to pick those up and put them in her mouth . 64020_66960
*PAR0:	&-um and the other things . 66960_70200
*PAR0:	yeah . 70200_70400
*PAR0:	she was trying to eat the ice cream cone even though she's never had an ice cream cone . 70400_74580
*PAR0:	so I'm not sure where she learned that . 74580_76020

*PAR0:	but she does &-um share my apples with me . 104200_107500
*PAR0:	so you know I think when I said apple she tried to say apple . 107500_111260
*PAR0:	&-um so I that might be why she liked that . 111260_115480
*PAR0:	but the other ones I think they just see seem to fit well in her mouth like the whatever that is over there . 115480_120840
