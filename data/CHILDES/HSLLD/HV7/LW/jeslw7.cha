*INV:	and &-um (.) I know [!] you've read The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle and I'd like you and your mom to write a letter [!] to Eric Carle about his book [!] .
@Comment:	Time is 0:14
@Comment:	Initially Chi seemed very enthusiastic about writing a letter to Eric Carle; she wanted to ask him to send her a copy of his book. It was very difficult for her to stay focused on the task however. She took time to find just the right surface to write on , change her clothes , comment on her chair , and ask for an apple. Chi wanted Mot to write the letter. Mot was willing but EXP convinced her that Chi should do it. This made Chi very upset , but Mot told her she would tell her what to write. Chi had some trouble sitting through the dictation , and at one point Mot asked if she could write her thoughts down and read them out to Chi. Mot asked EXP how to spell language; other than that she seemed to have the task under control. When Mot suggested putting Chi's address at the end of the letter , Chi said <you can do that (be)cause I've done enough already>.
