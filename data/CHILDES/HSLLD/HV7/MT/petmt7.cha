*CHI:	so dad how was your [!] night last night ?
@Comment:	Time is 0:09. Affected , playing up for the tape recorder
@Comment:	Chi , MOT , and Fat are eating together. Throughout most of the meal , FAT talks in an unemotional , unaffected monotone , Chi is very animated , and Mot is more animated when talking to Chi and unemotional when talking to Fat. All took part , to different degrees , in the various discussion topics. There was the newspaper at the table , so most of the discussions centered around it. They discussed the hockey player <Timmy Roy?> who was paralyzed in an accident , a statue of Bugs Bunny which was mentioned in the newspaper , a few people they all knew , Chi's science homework which was to find an article in the newspaper about science , a friend that Chi was supposed to call the day before , a few other things from the paper , possible plans for the day , Chi sang a few lines from a song , and a few other things. Noteworthy is Mot and Fat's in depth discussion of the hockey player's paralysis to Chi , who did not really understand what paralysis is. Rare words= paralyzed , paraplegic , quadriplegic.
