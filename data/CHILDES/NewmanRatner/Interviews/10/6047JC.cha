*PAR0:	I don't know . 24640_25640

*PAR0:	he s showed more interest this time in the stuffed animals than he had before . 49020_52480
*PAR0:	&-um last time he wasn't interested in them at all . 53260_56280
*PAR0:	&-um and then &-um showed a [/] a little interest in the book but not so much being read to as much as just kind of grabbing it and turning the pages . 57720_67420
*PAR0:	so do you have &-uh a lot of books at home . 68340_71860

*PAR0:	and he likes to pull them off the shelf and play with them . 78000_80500
*PAR0:	so I think maybe he sees them more as toys than books right now . 80500_84220
*PAR0:	probably . 84220_85280
*PAR0:	do you have any books that are the same as these . 85280_88860

*PAR0:	and we have pets too . 123100_124100
*PAR0:	&-um I had a feeling you had a pet . 124820_127960
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 128320_128760
*PAR0:	because you were saying . 129140_130080
*PAR0:	gentle [/] gentle . 130080_131040
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 131040_132080

*PAR0:	yeah we have cats two cats and a dog . 136080_138100
*PAR0:	so he's used to animals . 138820_141840
*PAR0:	so do you think he recognized that dog ever . 142740_146380
*PAR0:	I'm not sure he recognized it as a dog . 146580_148680
*PAR0:	&-um but I think he recognized me saying dog maybe because we use the word dog a lot . 149820_156980
*PAR0:	I say . 157160_157720
*PAR0:	like . 157720_157860
*PAR0:	is that your dog and what kind of dog do you have . 157860_161340
*PAR0:	we have a black lab who's like eighty pounds . 161380_163520
*PAR0:	I was gonna say . 164100_165100
*PAR0:	do they look similar . 165100_165980
*PAR0:	yeah I mean obviously your dog's not pink but yeah . 166240_169620
*PAR0:	do you think &-uh he recognized any of the other animals or names of animals . 170360_181080
*PAR0:	&-um I don't think so . 181080_183860
*PAR0:	I'm trying to think if we have anything similar at home we don't really we have some puppets but they're not kangaroos or anything . 184240_193500
*PAR0:	does he like puppets . 193500_195320
*PAR0:	yeah we don't play with him very much . 195320_197600
*PAR0:	&-um we got . 197600_198360
*PAR0:	him for Christmas and we play with him more . 198360_200180
*PAR0:	but &-um yeah he really likes we have like little &-um finger type puppets . 200180_205260
*PAR0:	hi . 205260_205920
*PAR0:	and he likes when if you play with like a puppet or stuffed animal . 205920_209100
*PAR0:	and you like pretend to kiss him on the cheek . 209100_210820
*PAR0:	he really likes that . 210820_211880
*PAR0:	and he puts everything in his mouth . 212100_217360
*PAR0:	I think every baby does . 218640_219740
*PAR0:	yeah . 219820_220080
*PAR0:	so &-uh what other food items do you think he likes . 220660_228460
*PAR0:	since he likes food items or these food items so much . 228460_232020
*PAR0:	&-um like he liked . 232020_233700
*PAR0:	yeah the burger and the lunch meat a lot . 233700_237380
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know if he knows that they're food or just like something to play with . 238040_244660
*PAR0:	but he does &-um he eats like all four plates at home . 245340_248340
*PAR0:	so he eats like really [/] really like spaghetti noodles and &-um fruits and vegetables and cheerios . 248440_256660
*PAR0:	but he's good at feeding himself . 256660_260800
*PAR0:	that's good . 260800_261760
*PAR0:	that's a baby . 261760_264700
*PAR0:	that's a baby . 264700_267580
*PAR0:	do you use utensils at home with him . 267580_271180
*PAR0:	we like if we have applesauce or like a puree we'll feed him with a spoon . 271180_275220
*PAR0:	but he just like flings stuff with a spoon . 275220_277960
*PAR0:	so usually we don't let him really use the spoon . 277960_280420
*PAR0:	&-um we just give him like whole pieces of like chicken or whatever . 280420_286020
*PAR0:	we're feeding him like fist size . 286020_288020
*PAR0:	so he can like gnaw off of it . 288020_290120
*PAR0:	so he doesn't really use utensils he sees us using them . 290120_293160
*PAR0:	and he'll sit still while we feed him applesauce or yogurt . 293160_297560
*PAR0:	so out of all of these items which one do you think is most familiar to him . 297800_310600
*PAR0:	&-um probably the board books are really familiar . 310600_316440
*PAR0:	we don't have any play food but I know there's some play food in the church . 316440_320420
*PAR0:	nursery . 320420_320740
*PAR0:	so every now and then he plays with play food . 320740_323340
*PAR0:	so I mean that would be more novel to him because we have books . 323340_327560
*PAR0:	and we have &-um some stuffed toys at home and a baby doll with the baby doll . 327560_334380
*PAR0:	&-um I noticed what do you think . 334380_338560
*PAR0:	do you think he knows how to feed the baby . 338560_341240
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 341240_342400
*PAR0:	he didn't really take bottles . 342400_343840
*PAR0:	&-um so sometimes he sees other babies . 343840_347420
*PAR0:	do you think he recognized the bottle . 348440_349880
*PAR0:	&-um I think so I mean he's had them like time to time . 350360_356340
*PAR0:	it's not it's hard to know because it's like it it's a different size and stuff . 357380_360880
*PAR0:	but I don't know if he would make that connection . 360880_364680
*PAR0:	so I noticed when you were reading the books that you were using a lot of noises that the animals make . 368060_381580
*PAR0:	mhm . 381620_381880
*PAR0:	&-um do you do that a lot at home . 382220_384980
*PAR0:	and if so what do you tend to which animals do you play with . 384980_389560
*PAR0:	&-um we have like a barnyard like play set for him . 389560_394280
*PAR0:	yeah not bad . 394280_394720
*PAR0:	yeah . 394720_395500
*PAR0:	so like the barnyard animals like cow and pig . 395500_399540
*PAR0:	and so yeah if we're playing with that set with him then we'll make the noises . 399540_403520
*PAR0:	&-um and then our book that's like this has like ducklings and sheep . 403520_409180
*PAR0:	we'll make the noises too . 409180_410680
*PAR0:	I wouldn't say we do it on like a regular basis . 411080_413140
*PAR0:	maybe like once or twice a week he does a lot of like playing on his own kind of exploring . 413700_421240
*PAR0:	no . 421240_423040
*PAR0:	&-uh do you think &-uh he gets scared or no [/] no [/] no not at all . 423040_433240
*PAR0:	he's not scared of them at all . 433240_435380
*PAR0:	he's left alone . 435380_436860
*PAR0:	I guess he's used to it by now . 436860_438580
*PAR0:	yeah . 438580_439200
*PAR0:	and even like our cats will like fight with each other . 439200_442160
*PAR0:	and he just watches like . 442160_444000
*PAR0:	so I don't think the [/] the noises scare him even if the dog's like barking at something outside . 444000_449920
*PAR0:	he doesn't seem even really startled anymore . 449920_453800
*PAR0:	you chewing on that spoon . 453800_459100
*PAR0:	hi a happy baby . 459240_462160
*PAR0:	so &-um you said he likes certain toys because of texture . 462160_469680
*PAR0:	does he &-uh use to does he like to make noise with toys . 469680_474820
*PAR0:	<do you> [/] do you have any toys at home that make a lot of noise . 474820_477080
*PAR0:	or does he prefer quieter . 477080_478280
*PAR0:	we have . 478280_478800
*PAR0:	yeah . 478800_479160
*PAR0:	he really is into the ones that &-um make noise like the leap frog table that you know plays like the piano things like that . 479160_488540
*PAR0:	&-um he definitely shows a preference for like the noise and lights . 488540_493020
*PAR0:	but then he'll also I mean he has like the toy binary animals . 494020_498420
*PAR0:	they don't make any noise . 498420_499420
*PAR0:	and he'll just like carry around like this little pig . 499420_502200
*PAR0:	and like put the pig on the couch or put the pig on the stairs . 502200_504980
*PAR0:	so <he does> [/] he does play with like non-electronic toys too . 504980_510500
*PAR0:	and do you think he's &-uh attractive to certain . 510500_516980
*PAR0:	and if so which ones I haven't noticed him attracted to colors . 516980_521240
*PAR0:	not like brighter colors or anything . 521240_524240
*PAR0:	not really I'm trying to think with the toys if he showed any preference . 524240_531560
*PAR0:	but okay . 531560_534820
*PAR0:	&-um &-um one last question . 534820_537940
*PAR0:	so do you &-um use a lot of words of encouragement . 538960_542980
*PAR0:	and you know if he does something what do you normally do if he does something . 543360_548660
*PAR0:	like . 548660_548900
*PAR0:	great . 548900_549220
*PAR0:	&-um you say something or do you clap or we usually say something . 549840_554060
*PAR0:	we haven't &-um really done the clapping . 554140_556380
*PAR0:	I know some of my friends . 556560_557200
*PAR0:	because I've learned clapping . 557200_558180
*PAR0:	he hit my husband says he can clap . 558340_560960
*PAR0:	but I haven't really seen it . 561100_562480
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah we'll say like good job or sometimes we'll just acknowledge what he's doing . 562880_567240
*PAR0:	like we'll say like . 567420_568120
*PAR0:	oh you can pull yourself up but not try to give him a lot of like empty praise . 568120_572980
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah we don't I mean I'm sure I do say like . 572980_577940
*PAR0:	oh good job . 577940_578700
*PAR0:	or you're such a big boy like that like from time to time . 578700_581580
*PAR0:	but a lot of times we try to just act naturally . 581580_584200
*PAR0:	and &-um just kind of acknowledge what he's about a month . 584200_598600
*PAR0:	okay . 598600_599100

*PAR0:	okay . 608400_608660
*PAR0:	yes pretty much the same questions . 608660_610180
