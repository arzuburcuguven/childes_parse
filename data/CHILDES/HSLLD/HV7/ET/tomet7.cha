@Comment:	Time is 43:15. This is side A. Videotape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
@Comment:	MOT and Chi spend a good deal of time working on their own projects; they disagree frequently about what to do although most of the arguing seems in fun; there is almost no science talk at all; there is a brief discussion of which objects stick; and the Chi demonstrates to the Mot that some objects which she thought were not magnets do stick
*MOT:	oh .
*INV:	I'll [/] I'll just watch out .
*INV:	(be)cause those things are magnetized .
*INV:	and they demagnetize tapes .
