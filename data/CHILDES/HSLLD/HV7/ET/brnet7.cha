@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	here I have <some objects that I> [//] like some we asked you to play with about four years ago ?
@Comment:	Time is 23:51
@Comment:	MOT does most of the talking , but both Mot and Chi seem to direct the activity equally. Mot , however , is more verbally directive. For the most part , MOT and Chi spend the time between two activities: moving the yellow wand by holding the balls above it and building a structure , which Mot refers to as <modern art> , on the black base. There is some discussion of which objects are magnets , and Mot notes that coins do not stick.
*INV:	www .
%sit:	explains the activity and tells participants that she'll be videotaping their hands
*MOT:	okay .
*INV:	www .
%com:	mumbles about what she's doing
%sit:	MOT and Chi sit at a table; Chi is facing the camera; only Mot's arms are visible; objects are spread out in front of them; Mot removes objects from the black base while Chi picks up different objects from the table

*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	(.) mom .
%act:	holds the red ball over the yellow wand which now rests on the table; the red ball and the wand repel each other so that the wand moves

*CHI:	(..) mom this [= the horseshoe magnet] could be from the xxx .
*MOT:	(..) let me put this one [= a nut] and then put it all [= the magnets and other objects] on there [= the black base] .
%sit:	during pause , MOT plays more with the wand and ball and then passes it to Chi and begins putting objects on the base while Chi plays with the wand and another ball momentarily before playing with the base with Mot
*MOT:	then like this [= referent unclear] .
*MOT:	ten minutes .
