*PAR0:	does she recognize any of those food the foods from like a home you think or like does she like to eat anything like that or now . 125040_135740
*PAR0:	well I don't think she read because like I haven't given her a Kiwi &-um she doesn't eat like Donuts and stuff . 135740_141940
*PAR0:	but I think she still recognizes it as food . 142700_145360
*PAR0:	but I think &-uh one of the things I knows her &-um the actual action like with the spoon . 145680_151280
*PAR0:	and she took a spoon and was like stirring a bowl or something like that . 151280_155380
*PAR0:	so I she was kind of copying me . 155420_156780
*PAR0:	does she try help you in the kitchen at all . 157300_158640
*PAR0:	oh she definitely tries to help in the kitchen . 158640_161200

*PAR0:	&-um <I haven't> [/] &-um I haven't had her help me with it . 168840_173880
*PAR0:	but like when she eats she'll sometimes play with it . 173880_177540
*PAR0:	<mm hm> [/] mm hm . 177680_178500
*PAR0:	and then she does she know like did she know what the stove was . 178680_181140
*PAR0:	I wasn't really watching too much . 181160_182100
*PAR0:	yeah she knows what the stove is because she knows she's not supposed to play with a stove . 182100_185740
*PAR0:	well you know the real one . 185860_186840

*PAR0:	yeah they always get kind and told not to touch it right [/] right [/] right [/] right . 190040_194040
*PAR0:	and then did she seem to be interested . 194320_195920
*PAR0:	in the book at all or did she not even notice it . 195920_198100
*PAR0:	I don't even know if she noticed it . 198360_200020
*PAR0:	but usually I found like when there's like a lot of toys and stuff . 200440_203240
*PAR0:	I can almost give up a book . 203240_205300
*PAR0:	you know don't even bother . 205760_207200
*PAR0:	yeah . 207400_207640
*PAR0:	yeah . 207780_208040
*PAR0:	but at home she likes to read books . 208480_210000
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 210060_210620
*PAR0:	she'll actually go for a book over &-um the toys . 210940_215260
*PAR0:	I don't know if <the day> [/] the day care provider . 215540_217880
*PAR0:	she also said that Michelle is always grabbing books . 217880_221000
*PAR0:	she'll play with toys too . 221040_222300
*PAR0:	but more than the other kids she'll grab books . 222860_224860
*PAR0:	yeah you were you have like cards to chat [/] chat . 225380_227520
*PAR0:	are you gonna chat and chat or read or something like . 227520_229540
*PAR0:	yeah . 229640_230180
*PAR0:	well yeah she could probably read like maybe fifty words or something like that . 230180_234320
*PAR0:	but &-um well you know I have a big mama purse . 234320_237740
*PAR0:	so a little bit of everything in there . 237740_239680
*PAR0:	&-um sometimes like if we're at a place where she needs to be quiet or settled down or something . 240520_246660
*PAR0:	or if she seems real anxious and a lot of energy I usually can get her to calm down and sit still if I you know play one of the you know get one of the books or the flashcards or something like that . 246660_257800
*PAR0:	I was trying to use it to just get her to . 258280_259840
*PAR0:	I don't know . 259840_261160
*PAR0:	she [/] she knew much of them . 261800_263060
*PAR0:	right . 263060_263260
*PAR0:	I mean it seemed like . 263300_264080
*PAR0:	yeah she knows a lot of them . 264120_265260
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah that's why I thought when we had the book with the letters I thought she would like it . 265500_269680
*PAR0:	you know of this because she was . 269680_276480
*PAR0:	even at that point she didn't want it . 276480_278080
*PAR0:	yeah I thought so too . 278080_279320
*PAR0:	&-um but we honestly for the letters we just taught her a through j .
*PAR0:	so I didn't think we were supposed to do it . 279320_288020
*PAR0:	but normally I would have said . 288020_289400
*PAR0:	where's C for cat . 289400_290840
*PAR0:	and then she would find C but I think that wasn't the point of it . 290840_294140
*PAR0:	yeah . 294160_294420
*PAR0:	except for that it was sort of just looking at like . 294420_296380
*PAR0:	&-um you didn't want a name matching . 296380_298600
*PAR0:	yeah matching like . 298600_299640
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah . 299640_300720
*PAR0:	so &-um but yeah I was thinking like . 301740_303600
*PAR0:	oh maybe she'll like it because the letters are in it . 303600_305560
*PAR0:	but I think she just it's such a long visit . 305560_307860
*PAR0:	so but she [/] she held up for most of it . 307860_309760
*PAR0:	you know I think this is more fun you know . 309760_312360
*PAR0:	yeah . 312440_312960
*PAR0:	so is what does she usually like to play with at home . 313420_315900
*PAR0:	like . 315980_316100
*PAR0:	is there like a kitchen or like . 316100_317100
*PAR0:	yeah . 317440_317820
*PAR0:	she has a little &-um a little kitchen set . 317820_321140
*PAR0:	mhm . 321440_321600
*PAR0:	&-um and then she has &-um a little basketball hoop that she plays with . 322360_328300
*PAR0:	and a little like toy laptop . 328300_331340
*PAR0:	but actually what she plays with the most that I think about . 332520_334620
*PAR0:	even though we got all those things . 334620_335760
*PAR0:	we have this refrigerator letter set like it's a magnet . 336080_339360
*PAR0:	and you take the letter . 339960_340960
*PAR0:	and you put it in the device . 340960_343520
*PAR0:	and it'll say a says . 344040_346040
*PAR0:	ah . 346040_346420
*PAR0:	and a says every letter makes sense . 346420_348440
*PAR0:	and she'll just take them and put the different letters . 348920_351460
*PAR0:	but that might just be because when I'm in the kitchen cooking and I need her away from the stove . 351600_356960
*PAR0:	like playing with that toy on the refrigerator is the default . 356960_361600
*PAR0:	yeah . 362000_362120
*PAR0:	mm . 362680_363260
*PAR0:	hm . 363260_363480
*PAR0:	and she likes to play basketball at school . 363520_365880
*PAR0:	mm . 366340_366600
*PAR0:	hm . 366600_366940
*PAR0:	so she more is she more sorta into like does she like to play outside more than like sitting down with vegetable soup . 367460_372420
*PAR0:	something like this . 372420_373080
*PAR0:	oh she definitely yeah prefers outside for sure with no toys . 373080_377400
*PAR0:	she'll just run . 377400_378700
*PAR0:	does mommy have . 380240_380840
*PAR0:	and you said she didn't have any siblings . 380840_381980
*PAR0:	right . 381980_382320
*PAR0:	no [/] no [/] no [/] no . 382480_384180
*PAR0:	yeah she [/] she looked like she kind I was kind of not watching too much . 384600_387800
*PAR0:	but it looked like she was really independent you know playing with &-um the [/] the food set . 387800_392100
*PAR0:	and like looking at the toys so well provided that we're there to give her the names of because she'll just say this . 392100_400740
*PAR0:	and she'll just want you to name whatever she picks up . 400920_404220
*PAR0:	yeah she seemed to know that's the thing too . 404220_406000
*PAR0:	like I know with the pictures . 406000_407000
*PAR0:	I think she knew some of the you know the words if you had given it to her in real life . 407000_411960
*PAR0:	but like picture some of the kids . 411960_413740
*PAR0:	they just it's normed on you know a large group of kids . 413740_416820
*PAR0:	and sometimes they just don't recognize it in the book but know they know . 416820_419840
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah she knows more words than we should think . 419840_440600
*PAR0:	the earlier visit . 440600_441340
*PAR0:	I tried to read . 441340_442520
*PAR0:	but I didn't realize then that when there's a lot of distractions I don't even bother with the book . 442520_448860
*PAR0:	but if I was to break out one of the books that she recognized she would probably like want to read it . 448860_454160
*PAR0:	but that's only because she's familiar with it . 454160_456420
*PAR0:	but I also found books with like little . 456420_459380
*PAR0:	words she'll look at the picture . 459380_462400
*PAR0:	and then she's done with it opposed to like you know just the words . 462400_466680
*PAR0:	and then if she can read the word then she knows I'll show her the picture . 466680_471440
*PAR0:	so I guess that's when she's motivated to read the word because then she gets to see the rest of the picture . 471440_475800
*PAR0:	it's just a word . 475800_477820
*PAR0:	so she has to say it . 477820_479360
*PAR0:	and then I'll flip the picture . 479360_480560
*PAR0:	and then we can talk about the picture . 480560_482080
*PAR0:	like if the word is face . 482080_483900
*PAR0:	and she'll say face . 483900_484820
*PAR0:	and we know we'll flip it over . 484820_485900
*PAR0:	and well there's a picture of a girl's face . 485900_488040
*PAR0:	and we'll talk about her eyes and her nose and stuff like that . 488040_491420
*PAR0:	but &-um we usually read regular books at night before . 491420_496860
*PAR0:	it's time for her to go to bed . 496860_498020
*PAR0:	so I totally have her undivided attention . 498020_500680
*PAR0:	and she's really into it and stuff . 500680_502420
*PAR0:	but usually there's nothing around or . 502420_503880
*PAR0:	yeah I mean this is much more fun like all of exactly I've been reading . 503880_508000
*PAR0:	yeah . 508200_508460
*PAR0:	so and [/] and this [/] this play set has a lot more than the other one . 508600_511860
*PAR0:	you know it's like overwhelming . 512020_513840
*PAR0:	I think a little think we caught the end of the audio on here . 513840_535460
*PAR0:	so I think we're good . 535460_536100
*PAR0:	but it's all on the camera . 536100_537000
*PAR0:	so we should . 537000_537360
*PAR0:	oh okay don't know . 537380_538000
*PAR0:	sorry . 538000_538260
*PAR0:	I didn't mean to like be distracting you guys . 538260_539740
*PAR0:	oh no it's fine . 539740_540640
*PAR0:	all sudden it stopped working &-uh huh but okay . 540800_543660
*PAR0:	and then the last thing I have . 543660_544960
*PAR0:	oh I think the questionnaire you said . 544960_546660
*PAR0:	yeah . 546680_546920
