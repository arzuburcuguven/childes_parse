@Comment:	Present at this mealtime are Chi , Chi's three younger sisters Sis , SI2 , and SI3 , and Mot. Towards the end , MOT's boyfriend FAT and her friend FRI enter into the scene and discussion. During most of the mealtime , Chi , SIS , and SI2 sing snippets of different songs , even though Mot says a few times she does not allow singing at the table. Otherwise , conversation is about things like the meal and a few other things. It is difficult to understand most of the conversation as the family members often speak at the same time , and with their mouths full. It is also very difficult to tell the difference between Sis's and SI2's voices as they are one year apart in age.
