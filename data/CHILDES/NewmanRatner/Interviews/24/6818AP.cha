*PAR0:	okay . 149220_149440
*PAR0:	mainly because we figured it be frustrating . 149640_151880
*PAR0:	and she's mostly at home interested in like the nurturing . 152100_155080
*PAR0:	like she has a little washcloth and little empty shampoo bottles . 155080_159160
*PAR0:	and she like gives the baby bath . 159160_160840
*PAR0:	and it's like an hour long ordeal of ch [/] ch [/] ch [/] ch [/] ch . 160840_165420
*PAR0:	and then like rubbing . 165420_166480
*PAR0:	and we let her actually use baby wipes . 166480_168900
*PAR0:	and she scrubs her babies down . 168900_171440
*PAR0:	so it's another clean &-uh huh . 171440_174320
*PAR0:	&-uh so [/] so the stuff with the clothes . 175320_177860
*PAR0:	she's never really done that before . 177860_178800
*PAR0:	yeah I we don't really have &-um she doesn't have like a I don't know a girl doll . 178800_187440
*PAR0:	she has like baby dolls you know what mean . 187580_189680
*PAR0:	so and are they just &-um I mean are they just kinda basic dolls . 189680_195100

*PAR0:	they just have like hands and feet but not and then like all . 206740_210600
*PAR0:	the rest of them are squishy . 210600_211460
*PAR0:	she's obviously very interested in it . 212980_216780
*PAR0:	so it's definitely something to . 216780_218160
*PAR0:	yeah . 219200_219520
*PAR0:	maybe [/] maybe it was tough getting the shoes on &-uh huh &-um was there anything else that she looked at today . 219860_229580
*PAR0:	&-uh she briefly looked at the animals . 230140_232180
*PAR0:	but mostly she just kind of like threw them around . 232180_234520
*PAR0:	she didn't actually engage in them . 234740_237480
*PAR0:	mhm . 237820_238020
*PAR0:	in the same way that she does with you know the other things is that pretty typical . 238580_243780
*PAR0:	she &-uh yeah she does . 243780_246480
*PAR0:	she definitely gravitates to the more gender specific things . 246960_252980
*PAR0:	we have trucks and like the playmat . 252980_255800
*PAR0:	and we have &-uh airplanes . 255800_258200
*PAR0:	and we have all kinds of animals . 258200_259940
*PAR0:	and we have all kinds of stuff . 259940_261320
*PAR0:	but &-uh sometimes she will take an animal and then put it in the baby high chair . 261320_265040
*PAR0:	and proceed to feed it dinner . 265040_266680
*PAR0:	I mean it's really funny . 266680_268080
*PAR0:	how just left to her own devices . 268080_269540
*PAR0:	the stuff that she chooses to do right . 269540_272860
*PAR0:	and she's obviously very busy . 272860_275640
*PAR0:	she's just a busy little person . 275640_277180
*PAR0:	uh-huh what's happening there . 277180_283480
*PAR0:	yeah . 283480_285460
*PAR0:	see &-um is this kinda similar to what she'd done in previous play sessions . 288680_292600
*PAR0:	&-um or did she play with different things . 292600_296320
*PAR0:	no . 296320_296620
*PAR0:	<she played> [/] she played a lot with the food &-uh in previous play sessions . 296620_300720
*PAR0:	but it was less about cooking the food and more just about like manipulating it . 300720_305860
*PAR0:	now she spends a lot of time in our kitchen when we're cooking . 305860_309220
*PAR0:	and so now that's what she's very obviously like you know stirring and mixing and cooking it . 309220_315380
*PAR0:	and it's hot and blowing on all these things . 315380_317620
*PAR0:	that she didn't really do that before it was just about kind of like messing around . 317620_321320
*PAR0:	with the food . 321320_321840
*PAR0:	yeah . 321840_322180
*PAR0:	&-um is there anything else that she typically plays with at home that we don't have here . 322180_328980
*PAR0:	yeah . 328980_329620
*PAR0:	she plays a lot with &-um she has a set of like magnetic letters that she plays with a lot . 329620_336520
*PAR0:	especially when we're in the kitchen . 336520_338520
*PAR0:	&-um they talk . 338520_341380
*PAR0:	there's like a little device you put them in . 341380_343320
*PAR0:	and it sings a little song about them . 343320_344700
*PAR0:	she plays with that to no end . 344780_346540
*PAR0:	and then &-um also I would say drawing and stuff . 346740_353360
*PAR0:	mean she did that there . 353460_354280
*PAR0:	but yeah you want this off . 354280_356580
*PAR0:	yeah . 356680_356860
*PAR0:	okay . 357060_357280
*PAR0:	&-um we have a little easel . 357920_360520
*PAR0:	and so it's very easy for her to just get on her own you know &-uh play with the crayons and or the chalk or whatever . 360880_368760
*PAR0:	so she does that a lot . 369500_371420
*PAR0:	but otherwise I think like the babies and the food are like . 371560_374420
*PAR0:	there's a lot of time spent and well in a shopping cart too like shopping around the house . 375100_380620
*PAR0:	she says she's going to the mall . 381020_382380
*PAR0:	and she picks up things all over the house and puts it in the shopping cart . 382780_385820
*PAR0:	and she has a little play wallet and stuff too like you can't make it up . 385820_392100
*PAR0:	it's just what they do . 392100_393960
*PAR0:	exactly . 393960_396160
*PAR0:	yeah . 396160_396780
*PAR0:	&-um and did you notice anything today during the session that you wanted to bring up anything . 396780_402860
*PAR0:	you had any questions about . 402860_406420
*PAR0:	&-um I don't think so . 406420_409740
*PAR0:	I mean the only thing that I've noticed that she just started doing was on the way here . 409740_415040
*PAR0:	she told me there were two buses . 415040_416980
*PAR0:	and that's the first time I have ever noticed her like plural anything . 416980_421700
*PAR0:	&-um she's been doing like you know shopping . 421700_426320
*PAR0:	mixing putting ends on the end of things for a little while . 426320_429460
*PAR0:	&-um but that was that kind of surprised me . 429460_434280
*PAR0:	&-um and then I was also surprised that she drew what you drew . 434280_439880
*PAR0:	yeah true . 439880_441100
*PAR0:	&-uh because last night we tried it . 441100_443260
*PAR0:	and she just basically scribbled all over my things . 443260_446580
*PAR0:	but she also takes great glee in scribbling all over what I have done . 446700_450160
*PAR0:	&-um we will make for a long time . 450360_454660
*PAR0:	I would do like on a Magnadoodle in the we take really long car trips . 454660_458220
*PAR0:	&-um and I would you know draw on it . 458820_461000
*PAR0:	and she would basically spend the next forty five minutes like blacking out the entire screen of what I had done . 461000_465940
*PAR0:	&-um so I think it's m I [/] I think it's more of a personal thing rather than a what she's able to do . 466700_471140
*PAR0:	right . 471200_471460
*PAR0:	yeah . 471820_473980
