@Comment:	The INV explains that Chi needs to write a letter to the author. Much time is taken in setting up for the activity , but finally Chi begins the letter. Mot tries to stimulate ideas for Chi , but Chi decides independently what he would like to write. Mot discusses with the INV , while Chi writes the letter , the problems with the school system and funding for special education. The cat serves as a distraction and source of divergence for Mot and INV. Chi asks Mot to spell a word for him. Mot wants Chi to sound it out , but to no success , and resorts to spelling it for him. Chi finishes the letter and then reads it aloud. Both INV and Mot are encouraging about the quality of the letter.
