*PAR0:	those are definitely tied for first the keys . 9140_12460
*PAR0:	if I had to pick one all right I would have to agree with you . 12460_18840
*PAR0:	yeah he likes hard plastic stuff . 18840_21980
*PAR0:	gotcha . 21980_22600
*PAR0:	unfortunately right you just wanna chew on plastic all day . 22600_27960
*PAR0:	so &-um there were three categories of toys . 27960_34580
*PAR0:	you know we had our stuffed animals . 34580_36460
*PAR0:	and then the other two categories which category do you think he liked the most the plastic food and stuff . 36460_43840
*PAR0:	right . 46560_47320
*PAR0:	&-um do you have any of that sort of stuff at home . 48800_57640
*PAR0:	yeah we have all the s stuff at home . 58260_60720
*PAR0:	but he [/] he gravitates towards the stuff even at home . 60720_64000
*PAR0:	do have &-uh like a play kitchen at home . 64220_67640
*PAR0:	no . 68360_69220
*PAR0:	so you think it's the first time you've seen like classic food . 70500_73740
*PAR0:	yeah . 74340_74760
*PAR0:	like we visited friends who have one but not you know like once . 75360_78680
*PAR0:	yeah I don't think he's especially I mean I think it's partly because that's just what I sort of set him down in front of . 79840_84040
*PAR0:	but he just likes to chew on hard plastic things . 84500_86320
*PAR0:	so he's teething he just got his first tooth . 86520_88780
*PAR0:	but he's never very into books . 89360_91380
*PAR0:	he never wants to sit still for books . 91440_92500
*PAR0:	so I'm not surprised that he's not super interested in this stack . 93120_96080
*PAR0:	do you've read to him . 97120_102020
*PAR0:	oh goodnight Moon we do but I didn't even see this or a version of this . 102020_106440
*PAR0:	yeah I tried him goodnight moon at bedtime but like I said he hates it . 106440_111020
*PAR0:	I can't get him to sit still for books yet . 111020_112720
*PAR0:	you hate it huh . 112720_116200

*PAR0:	she's not super into dolls . 134040_135060
*PAR0:	but we've got two that look kinda like that one roughly you know with a plastic sort of face . 135280_140440
*PAR0:	do you think she recognizes it . 141540_143700
*PAR0:	probably not because she hates to let him near them . 144380_147140
*PAR0:	she hides them from him . 147900_149080
*PAR0:	she hides all her toys . 149620_151300
*PAR0:	so I [/] I doubt it . 151680_154580
*PAR0:	I thought he'd be interested . 154580_155380
*PAR0:	because once he saw her doll and got excited about it . 155720_158300
*PAR0:	and was like I thought maybe it was like exciting to look like a baby . 158300_161340

*PAR0:	I think it feels cold . 239820_241340
*PAR0:	yeah it's kind of these little ridges . 241340_243640
*PAR0:	he can run on his gums or something . 243640_248000

*PAR0:	and he actually gets Grumpy at home when there's spoons around because he's like food . 283460_287120
