@Comment:	MOT and Chi both work together in making different constructions on the black base magnet and doing pretend play with the magnets. There is little science talk , though at one point they weem to investigate which pieces stick to the black base and which don't , and at another point Mot unsuccessfully tries to show Chi how some magnets repel others (without using the word repel). The mood is lighthearted and playful. Video tape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
*CHI:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	(.) xxx .
%com:	it is difficult to hear because magnets are being poured out onto a hard surface creating much noise

*CHI:	it [= one washer] fell !
*CHI:	again (.) this is the most dangerous stunt .
*CHI:	static cling .
%sit:	MOT has placed two colored paper clips on the washers at the top of the construction

%com:	Chi seems to be addressing the yellow wand to <let go> of the silver stick
*CHI:	that's funny +...

*CHI:	I'm gonna make a face again .
*MOT:	(wh)oops .
%act:	knocks over part of the construction
*CHI:	why [//] did you knock over a guy ?
*MOT:	yeah +...
*MOT:	I'll fix (th)em .

%act:	reaches over and places horseshoe magnet on yellow wand below the ball nose
*MOT:	this .
*CHI:	okay .
*CHI:	there's my human !
%act:	holds up wand so that face is toward the camera; horseshoe magnet falls off
*MOT:	whoops .
