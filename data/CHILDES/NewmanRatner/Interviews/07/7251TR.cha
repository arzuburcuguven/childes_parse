*PAR0:	so tell me about how you guys played with the food today . 0_4020
*PAR0:	so pretty much like I guess anytime I give him one of these . 4020_9580
*PAR0:	I would try to tell him what it was . 9580_11660
*PAR0:	so like I would hand him this and show him and say waffle . 11660_14640
*PAR0:	and then let him grab onto it and touch it and whatnot and then ice cream cone . 14640_21420
*PAR0:	like I gave him this . 21420_22620
*PAR0:	and I said . 22620_22880
*PAR0:	ice cream cone . 22880_23640
*PAR0:	but he can't eat this now right because it's plastic . 23640_26980
*PAR0:	but as you can see he still puts it in his mouth . 26980_29440
*PAR0:	&-um and then peas . 30120_31700
*PAR0:	&-um I said . 31700_32800
*PAR0:	peas . 32800_33360
*PAR0:	and I said . 33360_33900
*PAR0:	this is what you eat now . 33900_35100
*PAR0:	but you don't wanna eat this one because it's plastic . 35100_38600
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah . 39400_40020
*PAR0:	so I was trying to tell him what each of these were because we don't have toys like these . 40020_44840
*PAR0:	so &-um at home so I was trying to f tell him what he knows how to eat this too . 45720_51860
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah so I was just trying to kinda get an &-uh give him an idea of what these were . 52600_56640
*PAR0:	okay . 57420_57720
*PAR0:	so basically all of these were pretty familiar . 58480_61440
*PAR0:	even the words do you think for the foods things that he doesn't hear around the house . 61440_65220
*PAR0:	yeah I think he's heard ice cream &-um with my husband . 65220_70120
*PAR0:	and I at home when we we'd have discussions about ice cream Waffles I don't think he's heard that term yet . 70120_76220
*PAR0:	peas . 76220_77140
*PAR0:	he's definitely heard that term before . 77140_79040
*PAR0:	&-um because when we feed him we usually say . 79040_81600
*PAR0:	oh you're getting pies tonight or you're getting squash tonight . 81600_84960
*PAR0:	so I think he's heard that term more than [/] than once . 86080_89980
*PAR0:	here you go buddy . 91520_93520
*PAR0:	why don't . 94500_94800
*PAR0:	you sit close . 94800_95540
*PAR0:	how about the stuffed animals . 98160_100100
*PAR0:	how did he play with those or how did you both play with those . 100140_103480
*PAR0:	&-um what I did is just he was kind of facing this way . 103500_107020
*PAR0:	so he was kind of grabbing at these . 107180_109340
*PAR0:	so I went ahead and just grabbed the pool the poo doll . 109700_112480
*PAR0:	because &-um he's familiar with seeing poo dolls now . 112480_115900
*PAR0:	and &-um so he laughs at when he sees them . 116040_119000
*PAR0:	so I just grabbed this . 119400_120520
*PAR0:	and I showed him . 120520_121220
*PAR0:	and I said . 121240_121520
*PAR0:	oh it's poo . 121520_122380
*PAR0:	&-um but I didn't really grab at the other ones besides these . 122900_127080
*PAR0:	&-um because I figured these are some toys that he's never really seen before . 127780_132120
*PAR0:	so I wanted to show him those because we don't have these types of toys at home . 132400_136700
*PAR0:	we usually have stuffed animals . 136700_138740
*PAR0:	so &-um I didn't really he didn't really seem intrigued by them because he saw it was there . 138740_144160
*PAR0:	but he didn't really grab at them . 144160_145680
*PAR0:	he seemed to be grabbing more at these the plastic toys . 145680_149760
*PAR0:	and then this actually &-um I showed him I said bottle . 149760_154200
*PAR0:	and he [/] he grabbed it . 154200_155940
*PAR0:	and he flipped it this way of course and was trying to [/] to suck on it . 155940_160560
*PAR0:	is he presently taking a bottle . 161440_170340
*PAR0:	yes . 170600_170960

*PAR0:	and we've got like a several Dr Seuss books and some other small books that I'll read to him . 235780_242920

*PAR0:	&-um I don't really think so . 262220_271060
*PAR0:	I [/] I don't even know if he's just kind of usually when I read a book to him he likes to do this . 271060_277320
*PAR0:	I don't know if because of it's P texture . 277320_280720
*PAR0:	and it's shiny and the pictures . 280720_282980
*PAR0:	and sometimes he'll actually try to grab the book . 282980_286720
*PAR0:	and then of course try to stick it in his mouth . 286720_288700
*PAR0:	so and then now he's he recognizes the microphone . 288700_293580
*PAR0:	so he wants that . 293580_296360
*PAR0:	but yeah &-um he usually does that with books . 296360_299660
*PAR0:	he'll [/] he'll touch it and then try to grab it . 299660_302160

*PAR0:	and he'll try to grab at it . 425500_427020
*PAR0:	but we haven't got given him a chance to actually feed himself because it'll be all over him as you can see . 427060_435660
*PAR0:	&-um as when you're playing with him what are the types of things you say or do to grab his attention . 437080_443500
