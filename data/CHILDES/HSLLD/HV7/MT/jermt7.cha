@Comment:	Time is 0:04
@Comment:	this is a very long meal time (almost 24 minutes). most of the time the children are left alone and they talk a lot amongst themselves. the mom comes in and out of the conversation which includes topics such as what they are eating for dinner , school , babies , the boys the little sister likes , and the Power Rangers. because the mom is not always present at the dinner table , the conversation seems very natural.
