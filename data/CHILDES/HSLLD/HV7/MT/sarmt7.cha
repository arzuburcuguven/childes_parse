@Comment:	The tape lasts for 4:57. Chi , MOT , and Sis sit down to a very quick dinner , because Sis has basketball practice that evening. They discuss Chi's squaredancing at school , as well as some baby bunnies both she and her sister have seen. Their stepfather walks in the door during the last few second of the tape and is met with gasps of surprise becuase of his new hair+cut.
