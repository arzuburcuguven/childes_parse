*BRO:	the pizza's here [>] .
@Comment:	Time is 0:04
@Comment:	pizza for dinner. (Fast food mentioned throughout as source of sustenance) MT about 26.5 minutes with MOT , FAT , Chi , and Chi's 2 younger siblings. conversation centers around food and Christmas (yes there's singing) and is pretty orderly considering the number of children involved. FAT indulges in some rather banal questioning like number of days till Christmas. SIS reads part of a nutritional label for fruit punch. MT is mercifully cut off as BRO whines about a present he wants.
