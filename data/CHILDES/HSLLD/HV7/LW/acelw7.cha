What kind of caterpillar eat's that much when it's a baby to grow that big in a week? Thank's for writing the book. from , Talitha G.Chi writes a letter with her Father , but does not appear to interact with him much. Although there is music playing in the background , there is much silence in terms of verbal interaction. She asks EXP what the top line on the stationary is for. She is a little concerned that her letter might be too short , but she seems pleased with it , and she happily giggles when EXP praises her efforts.
