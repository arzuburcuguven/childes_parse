@Comment:	The beginning of the activity seems to have been cut off due to tape recorder difficulties. The recording begins , though , with Mot telling Chi about a part that she liked in the story , which Chi writes about in the letter. Chi then writes a sentence on her own , and Mot dictates the next. Chi signs it on her own , including both her name and her mother's. Mot's toddler nephew is in the background playing and making a lot of noise , distracting Mot from time to time.
