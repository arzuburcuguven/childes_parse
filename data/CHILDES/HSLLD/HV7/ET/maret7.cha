@Activities:	Magnet Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*CHI:	we <have one of these> [>] things in the classroom .
@Comment:	Time is 21:54
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play well together; EXP remains in the background throughout the activity. After a period of experimentation in which Mot and Chi note which objects stick to the magnets and which don't , and in which Mot and Chi observe objects being attracted to magnets without actually touching the magnet , and after a discussion of what makes magnets work , MOT and Chi move on to stacking objects on the base. Neither Mot nor Chi are able to give accurate explanations of how magnets attract certain objects. Chi does engage in some fantasy play when he pretends that some of the balls are the eggs of the turtle. Video tape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
