@Comment:	Time is 20:48. Video tape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio tape
@Comment:	MOT and Chi don't spend too much time in conversation during this activity , which takes place on the floor. Mot and Chi play separately most of the time , but they do play together at intervals throughout the activity. Mot and Chi direct the activities equally. Mot teases Chi in play , by taking one of his pieces for example , and Chi generally responds without aggression. There is a lot of laughing. There is some talk of how some things stick and others don't , but no discussion of why this happens. EXP is removed from the activity but laughs when something interesting happens and offers some positive reinforcement to Chi.
