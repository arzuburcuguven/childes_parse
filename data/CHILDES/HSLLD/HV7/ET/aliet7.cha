@Comment:	videotape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
@Comment:	Chi plays with the objects while Mot watches. Mot is silent for much of the activity and Chi seems to set her own agenda while Mot makes occasional suggestions. There is little science talk during the activity- at the beginning of the activity Mot asks Chi a few questions about which objects don't stick to the black base.
*INV:	oh yeah .
*MOT:	playin(g) on the big ball .
*MOT:	and +...
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*INV:	oh yeah .
*CHI:	xxx &=mumbles .
*CHI:	&=hums .
*CHI:	xxx &=mumbles .
*CHI:	(..) this doesn't stick .
*CHI:	0 [=! strange sounds] .
*MOT:	the lens is on .
*INV:	okay .
*MOT:	xxx .
*INV:	www .
%exp:	talks about camera
*INV:	okay .
*INV:	here we go .
*CHI:	xxx .

*CHI:	this xxx [>] +/.
*MOT:	<what else> [<] doesn't stick ?
%com:	video begins here
%sit:	MOT and Chi are seated next to one another at table; magnets are set up on the table in front of them; the black base is empty and the magnets are in a pile nearby

*CHI:	and &-uh this [= referent unclear] +...
*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	hm: .
*CHI:	&=sighs .
*MOT:	&=coughs .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up horseshoe magnet and sticks it to black base; picks it up and moves it around then leaves it on base in an upright position
*CHI:	(..) did that ?
%act:	sticks two silver sticks on the base so that they hang off the edge
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	attempts to stand a silver man on one of the silver sticks
*MOT:	(..) it [= silver man] willn't stand there [= on silver stick] huh ?
*CHI:	hm: .
*CHI:	giant .
*MOT:	hey .
*CHI:	(.) yeah !
*CHI:	I know what we can make now .
%act:	clears objects off black base
*CHI:	think xxx .
*CHI:	just gave me an idea .
%act:	places several nuts on the black base
*CHI:	(..) I'm gearing [?] up .
*MOT:	what are you makin(g) ?
*CHI:	I'm gonna make a maze .
*MOT:	okay .
*CHI:	it's +...
%act:	takes nuts off black base
*CHI:	this [= silver circle] makes it [= black base] more powerful .
%act:	picks up silver circle from table and puts it on black base
*CHI:	oh .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	it's [= silver circle] (.) kind of (.) hard .
%act:	tries to push silver circle across black base so it is centered
*CHI:	&-uh .
*CHI:	xxx .
*CHI:	(.) it's +...
*CHI:	oh I know what I can make now .
*CHI:	+^ this [= silver circle] is a ring +...
*CHI:	and (.) they're [= silver men] gonna fight with sticks .
%act:	stands three silver men in a circle on the silver circle on the black base; places silver sticks across their shoulders
*MOT:	(..) &=cough .
*CHI:	why don't I just use this [= yellow wand] ?
%act:	uses yellow wand to pick up objects from the table; adds two more silver men to the circle on the black base

*CHI:	(..) they [= silver men maybe] gotta try not to get past this [= referent unclear] .
*CHI:	see ?
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	places a paper clip at the edge of the construction on the silver circle
*CHI:	oh_man .
*CHI:	xxx .
*CHI:	go up like that .
%act:	places a paper clip at the edge of the construction on her side
*MOT:	it [= paper clip] willn't stand .
*CHI:	hm: .
*MOT:	and they [= paper clips] keep goin(g) back over to this [= edge of silver circle] .
*CHI:	yeah .
*CHI:	then we could put it [= paper clip] like that .
%act:	places paper clip on black base so that it hangs off the edge of the silver circle
*MOT:	see it ?
%act:	attempts to do what Chi just did but her paper clip sticks to the side of the black base
*CHI:	hm: .
*CHI:	(..) or xxx .
*CHI:	hold that [= blue arrow magnet] like that .
%act:	picks up blue arrow magnet and holds it over the construction so that the arrow points down at the circle of men

*CHI:	see that one xxx .
%int:	whispered
%act:	attempts to put the white magnet ball back on the silver man in the center of the black base

*CHI:	xxx .
*CHI:	&=hums .
*CHI:	there .
*CHI:	xxx &-uh be .
*CHI:	staying xxx up here .
%add:	paper clip
%act:	places a paper clip on top of the silver man that is on top of the blue arrow magnet
*CHI:	xxx staying .
*CHI:	this [= referent unclear] is .
*CHI:	oh no .
*CHI:	just fell .
%act:	picks up something and replaces it on black base
*CHI:	or this [= referent unclear] .
*CHI:	bad .
%sit:	several of the objects in Chi's construction have fallen over on the base and she is attempting to fix them
*CHI:	bad .
*CHI:	real bad .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	bad .
*CHI:	&=hums .
*CHI:	there .

*MOT:	&=laughs [>] .
*INV:	&=laughs [<] .
*CHI:	no .
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	there .
%sit:	Chi has fixed construction

*MOT:	what's that [= construction] sposta be ?
*MOT:	a circus ?
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	oh .
*CHI:	hm: .
%com:	one of the silver men in the construction falls over
*CHI:	circus where someone fell .

*MOT:	all done !
*CHI:	hm: .
*CHI:	okay .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
