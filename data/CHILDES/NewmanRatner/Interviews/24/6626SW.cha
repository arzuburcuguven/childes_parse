*PAR0:	she wasn't really interested in . 151280_152480
*PAR0:	she wasn't as interested in the dolls as I expected her to be just because like they had shoes . 152480_158740
*PAR0:	and normally she tries to put the shoes on the dolls . 158740_160720
*PAR0:	but she was mostly into the hat . 160720_163360
*PAR0:	and then she definitely did not like that lobster . 163360_167920
*PAR0:	she seemed pretty horrified by it . 167920_170840
*PAR0:	so &-um I thought she might like it because we had one once that she played with before it died . 170840_176500
*PAR0:	and &-um but no not so much . 176780_180580

*PAR0:	&-um and mostly what she does with them is she tucks them in . 188580_191500
*PAR0:	she puts them to she tries to feed them . 191600_193420
*PAR0:	&-uh not &-uh I don't think we even have clothes for any of them . 193420_198260
*PAR0:	okay . 198300_198440
*PAR0:	so [/] so that was [/] was that new for her or had she done it . 198620_201300
*PAR0:	yeah don't think I mean she'll try to put like her shoes or something on them . 201640_207600
*PAR0:	but I we don't have any doll . 207600_209000
*PAR0:	clothes . 209000_209300
*PAR0:	so she hasn't done that before . 209300_210520
*PAR0:	at least not at our house . 210680_211900
*PAR0:	I don't know what daycare involves . 211920_213820
*PAR0:	so right . 213820_214580
*PAR0:	yeah . 214800_214940
*PAR0:	&-um and then with the animals &-um were any of them . 215340_217740
*PAR0:	&-uh &-uh &-uh she seems pretty familiar with a lot of animals . 217740_221280
*PAR0:	yeah . 221420_221560
*PAR0:	she loves animals . 221560_222440
*PAR0:	were [/] were there any that were brand new for her . 222820_224420
*PAR0:	&-um let's see here there were definitely some that she hasn't seen before . 224660_232900
*PAR0:	at least not like in person like I'd a raccoon I think she might have seen one in a book or something . 232900_238580
*PAR0:	but not you know with any frequency right [/] right . 238580_241680
*PAR0:	&-uh so like I doubt she's seen a warthog . 241680_245820
*PAR0:	I assume that's what that is . 245820_247160
*PAR0:	&-um it's like I don't even know what some of these animals are . 247160_250800
*PAR0:	so yeah but I mean some of them it's funny like Yaks like she knows Yaks and Llamas like she thinks everything's a Llama now because &-um she has the l the Llama [/] Llama series of books . 250800_262420
*PAR0:	and then she has this one book that has a Llama in it . 262420_264660
*PAR0:	so she thinks they're very common . 264660_266120
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah so &-uh everything else I think is probably pretty familiar . 266120_271600
*PAR0:	but there's definitely a few that we haven't seen . 271600_274400
*PAR0:	did she have any favorite animals besides the Yak and Llamas yeah she likes oh yeah Yak and Llamas I don't know . 274400_283480
*PAR0:	I mean with these it's funny like we don't actually have animal figurines at home . 283480_288000
*PAR0:	most of the animals she sees are in books . 288000_290060
*PAR0:	&-um so I dunno . 290060_292700
*PAR0:	I mean she definitely seemed to gravitate more towards the other stuff . 292700_298820
*PAR0:	yeah . 298820_299160
*PAR0:	and then with the puzzles . 299160_300960
*PAR0:	&-um so has she ever seen anything . 300960_303180
*PAR0:	she has a lot of puzzles . 303180_305200
*PAR0:	but she doesn't have like I've never seen anything like this with the different seams and the magnets . 305200_310720
*PAR0:	&-um so I don't know . 310720_313640
*PAR0:	she seemed to like it though . 313640_314800
*PAR0:	yeah she did actually thought like . 314800_316360
*PAR0:	oh this is pretty cool . 316360_317220
*PAR0:	I might have to look this up . 317220_318160
*PAR0:	so yeah &-uh what kind of scenes did she . 318160_320500
*PAR0:	well we started with the farm that was the most of the focus . 321280_327880
*PAR0:	and it was funny . 327880_329520
*PAR0:	at first I didn't think she was gonna get the like which farm or which animals go in which scene . 329520_334120
*PAR0:	but it seemed like she was getting that toward the middle end of it . 334120_338960
*PAR0:	yeah . 338960_339300
*PAR0:	so we did the ocean a little bit not so much with the waterfall . 339300_343680
*PAR0:	but she likes waterfalls . 343680_345480
*PAR0:	I see . 345580_346180
*PAR0:	so yeah there was one in a restaurant we went to last weekend . 346480_349820
*PAR0:	oh so yeah she was looking at us with her eyes . 350240_352180
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah yes . 352180_353220
*PAR0:	exactly . 353220_353760
*PAR0:	yeah . 354100_354380
*PAR0:	they had people jumping into . 354380_355680
*PAR0:	it was pretty strange . 355680_356380
*PAR0:	right . 356380_356520
*PAR0:	but yeah . 356580_356960
*PAR0:	so &-um and any of the animals with &-uh different scenes were they ones she was pretty familiar with . 357740_363140
*PAR0:	yeah I mean I think she knows all of these animals . 363260_367520
*PAR0:	&-um for the most part like I don't think she's seen dolphins as much . 367520_373980
*PAR0:	but she knows like whale . 374100_375460
*PAR0:	and you know most of them she has as her bath toys or a lot of the water animals . 375460_380820
*PAR0:	&-um and then she knows farms pretty well . 381640_383460
*PAR0:	but I'm not sure if we had gotten to this one I'm not sure she would have known as much what goes in the waterfall scene . 383560_390080
*PAR0:	but that's always a tough one . 390700_392620
*PAR0:	I don't . 392620_392820
*PAR0:	know . 392820_393020
*PAR0:	yeah I don't really know because I'm not sure how I would have directed her on that one either . 393160_396940
*PAR0:	but I guess maybe the alligator going in . 396940_400120
*PAR0:	yeah so yeah but she likes moons a lot . 400200_404380
*PAR0:	okay . 404380_404920
*PAR0:	goodnight Moon &-um this thing I don't know . 404920_409440
*PAR0:	she didn't seem particularly interested in it . 409440_412880
*PAR0:	yeah I don't why she seems to really jump towards it . 412880_416460
*PAR0:	well it's tough because you don't actually have to twist it to make it go in there . 416460_420760
*PAR0:	so I think it's in there maybe for because there aren't a lot of really boy centered toys . 420760_426040
*PAR0:	so they saw they'd throw in a yeah double screws and a screwdriver . 426040_429960
*PAR0:	yeah it's [/] it's kind of a lame toy . 429960_432620
*PAR0:	it is . 432620_433100
*PAR0:	yeah . 433100_434000
*PAR0:	so did you notice anything about her play today that was &-um different from what she does at home or what she done in previous play sessions beyond her toys . 434000_444520
*PAR0:	and not really . 444520_445740
*PAR0:	I mean s she like most two year olds . 445900_448640
*PAR0:	if you put this many toys in front of her . 448640_451100
*PAR0:	she's kinda got add and yeah just wants to bounce from different things so well &-uh huh interesting . 451100_458840
*PAR0:	&-um and did you notice anything else today that I guess in the whole session that you wanted to ask about or anything . 459300_467280
*PAR0:	no I mean she's she seemed to warm up faster than I feared . 467780_472520
*PAR0:	so that's good . 472520_473680
*PAR0:	yeah she because sometimes she'll [/] she'll interact but she won't talk if she's nervous . 473820_478580
*PAR0:	yeah . 478580_479300
*PAR0:	so I not to start with some real talking activities . 479300_482740
*PAR0:	yeah a lot of two year olds are yeah a little wary a little shy which is good . 482740_487160
*PAR0:	I mean . 487160_487500
*PAR0:	yeah they shouldn't just yeah she seemed to do . 487500_490640
*PAR0:	well though yeah so [/] so yeah . 490640_493380
*PAR0:	so do you guys give &-um I know you're you don't give individual level feedback usually on these things . 493380_498800
*PAR0:	but is there anything from all the standardized tests we gave . 498800_502800
*PAR0:	we gave an expressive test a receptive language a visual receptive test . 502800_510500
*PAR0:	and a fine motor test and all of those . 510500_512840
*PAR0:	we're going to put the scores together . 512840_514180
*PAR0:	and we're going to send just okay . 514180_516280
*PAR0:	&-um you know with the standardized score and the percentile . 516280_518860
*PAR0:	okay . 519300_519560
*PAR0:	so that's more than I expected . 519660_520680
*PAR0:	yeah . 521000_521200
*PAR0:	cool . 521340_521440
*PAR0:	like I said the [/] the receptive test was norm for two and a half year olds . 521460_525080
*PAR0:	they'll have a note about that . 525220_526220
*PAR0:	but &-um she didn't agree . 526380_528080
*PAR0:	I mean she was fine with it . 528200_529200
*PAR0:	they were &-um yeah [/] yeah . 529280_532160
*PAR0:	okay . 532580_532800
*PAR0:	so &-um yeah I'm not too worried about her but it's always good to sparse very [/] very with it . 532820_539460
*PAR0:	yeah you know what you're doing . 539460_542460

*PAR0:	yeah . 564160_564700
*PAR0:	some of them are kind of guesses . 564700_566540
*PAR0:	but especially the ones that say like including other caregivers because honestly what happens at daycare it's hard to tell . 566540_574060
*PAR0:	they don't communicate at all . 574060_575340
*PAR0:	so I can explain it to you real quick . 575340_579740
