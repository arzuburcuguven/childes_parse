*PAR0:	first of all are any of these toys ones that you have at the house . 0_4120
*PAR0:	would you be familiar with . 4120_4920
*PAR0:	already we do have a whole bunch of kitchen stuff and doll babies . 4920_9100
*PAR0:	not specifically one that looks like that but and lots of stuffed animals and books . 9100_15080
*PAR0:	so pretty much everything . 15080_16600
*PAR0:	I mean nothing . 16600_18180
*PAR0:	I wouldn't say anything exactly the same . 18180_19740
*PAR0:	except [/] except for [/] for like [/] like this [/] this ice [/] ice cream [/] cream cone [/] cone would maybe be exactly [/] exactly the [/] the same . 19740_21880
*PAR0:	same . 21880_22900
*PAR0:	these maybe do you have those particular books . 22900_27640
*PAR0:	not board book versions . 27640_30200
*PAR0:	ah maybe this one I might have read like one time from the library or something kind of looked familiar but [/] but similar ones to this but not like the Dr Seuss board book or anything like that . 30200_41280
*PAR0:	yeah . 41280_42320
*PAR0:	what things do you think . 42320_47500
*PAR0:	he was most interested in . 47500_48960
*PAR0:	I think the keys [/] keys the bottle . 48960_54360
*PAR0:	&-um the waffles . 54360_57760
*PAR0:	&-um I think that was well this book . 57760_65500
*PAR0:	but for wrong reasons any idea why those particular things what it was that made them interesting . 65500_78600
*PAR0:	&-um I think this because of the biting the bottle cause it's a bottle . 78600_82380
*PAR0:	I definitely thought that was a bottle . 82660_83760
*PAR0:	&-um and I would assume this because he could hold it . 84060_88740
*PAR0:	and it was making a good noise . 88740_89960
*PAR0:	and he's biting it too . 91180_92160
*PAR0:	but I don't think he's getting much satisfaction out of the biting . 92280_94380
*PAR0:	yeah you like that . 95120_97500
*PAR0:	don't you see . 97500_101660
*PAR0:	look that's making him mad because he can't bite it . 101660_103600
*PAR0:	oh [/] oh no [/] no you poor baby . 104180_108740
*PAR0:	that was a mean trick . 108980_111180
*PAR0:	huh I think you're okay . 111180_117440
*PAR0:	oh my goodness . 117440_121300
*PAR0:	look here's Blue bear . 121300_124520
*PAR0:	are you crying because I'm you're just mad when he gets . 124520_225100
*PAR0:	very mad . 225100_225620
*PAR0:	he goes ma [/] ma Ma which seems really bizarre to me this young because my girls didn't say mama until they were sixteen months old but it's only raised man . 225620_236080
*PAR0:	that's a good thing . 236080_238640
*PAR0:	I don't want to take that to mean right . 238640_242160
*PAR0:	what do you think . 242160_244040
*PAR0:	oh no days are peas . 244040_246960
*PAR0:	why'd you pick out the particular stuffed animals you liked out of them . 246960_250260
*PAR0:	were they just the they were the closer ones or was there something . 250260_253060
*PAR0:	&-um well the puppet thing was kinda cool . 253060_255560
*PAR0:	initially I think I just pulled the frog just cause yeah it was like close . 255560_260520
*PAR0:	so this one's kinda different looking . 260520_262680
*PAR0:	I think he was sorta drawn to this one . 262680_264540
*PAR0:	and I kept thinking it was cause of that pink . 264540_266540
*PAR0:	but maybe I'm just making that up . 266540_268140
*PAR0:	it could have just been because it was close . 268220_270680
*PAR0:	&-um and poo bear like I made a song . 270680_276180
*PAR0:	so that was good . 276180_276980
*PAR0:	did he know poo bear . 276980_279780
*PAR0:	I would think just from that like I mean we poo bear bugs and stuff like with the girls . 279780_286340
*PAR0:	I mean he's always kind of like about the girls . 286340_288060
*PAR0:	but &-um we don't I don't think we have any videos or anything like that . 288060_293620
*PAR0:	so I'm not sure just from me singing it . 293620_296960
*PAR0:	what do you think . 297480_301800
*PAR0:	Abu [/] Abu you're so mad . 302120_311000
*PAR0:	do you want to crawl . 311000_315640
*PAR0:	look here's his keys again . 315640_321660
*PAR0:	he's just mad . 321660_327120
*PAR0:	I'm sorry . 327120_328700
*PAR0:	you don't want to lie down . 328700_332220
*PAR0:	you don't want to see me . 332220_333460
*PAR0:	I'm sorry . 333460_336400
*PAR0:	hey what's wrong . 336400_338200
*PAR0:	what's wrong . 338200_340180
*PAR0:	you want to sing . 340180_343700
*PAR0:	hey baby Max [/] Max [/] Max all dressed in slacks [/] slacks [/] slacks with silver buttons [/] buttons [/] buttons all down his back [/] back [/] back . 343700_354500
*PAR0:	he reached so high [/] high [/] high he touched the sky [/] sky [/] sky I . 354500_359920
*PAR0:	don't know where he went . 359920_361880
*PAR0:	what why'd I'm <a brr> [/] a brr . 361880_423820
*PAR0:	oh you say <ma mama> [/] ma mama [/] mama mad . 459540_475180
*PAR0:	I love you walk [/] walk [/] walk [/] walk [/] walk [/] walk . 516640_545300
*PAR0:	good boy did a good boy walk [/] walk [/] walk . 545300_551840
*PAR0:	how much of his playtime at home is spent with stuff that's really more his age or his age toys as compared to like his sisters . 569820_577620
*PAR0:	right . 577620_578280
*PAR0:	&-um it's a good question . 578280_581420
*PAR0:	I would say most of it maybe like eighty percent (be)cause &-um he's kind of either in the Exer saucer or like Jumparoo kind of stuff or on the floor with like I try and pull out little stuffed animals or you know like this kind of stuff . 581420_595840
*PAR0:	this is pretty much right . 595840_597540
*PAR0:	&-um it's within reach . 597540_600080
*PAR0:	and then &-um I would say the rest of the time he's kind of either into stuff . 600080_606900
*PAR0:	he shouldn't be like the barbies like bigger things or the girls like entertain him a lot . 606900_612100
*PAR0:	they'll dance in front of him . 612100_613000
*PAR0:	and they'll try and make him giggle and stuff . 613000_616220
*PAR0:	so he definitely has like a lot of that kind of entertainment . 616220_619720
*PAR0:	oh no he's getting mad again in general . 648000_657320
*PAR0:	do you think he prefers toys or books like reading with you . 657320_661780
*PAR0:	umthat's a good question . 661780_666140
*PAR0:	he tends to be pretty attentive with the books which I'm surprised at . 666140_670000
*PAR0:	but like if I'm reading a book to the girls that's kind of like too boring . 670000_675540
*PAR0:	you know what I mean like it's gotta be something where the pages are flipping . 675540_677560
*PAR0:	and he's in my lap . 677560_679020
*PAR0:	it needs to be sort centered . 679020_680060
*PAR0:	he's pretty good at like sort of entertaining himself though with toys . 680060_687060
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know what do you think I'd say . 687060_692720
*PAR0:	probably he prefers to play with toys but you know . 692720_699820
*PAR0:	to be fair . 699820_700340
*PAR0:	I don't riddle at those things . 700340_701860
*PAR0:	you get the short end of the stick . 701860_704040
*PAR0:	don't you buddy <why so mad> [/] why so mad . 704040_708900
*PAR0:	he loves like personal attention though because I think he doesn't get as much as he could . 708900_725060
*PAR0:	so he loves like just sitting on it and laughing or whatever . 725060_730960
*PAR0:	right . 730960_734080
*PAR0:	yeah what you want to stand there you go . 734080_741140
*PAR0:	oh I think that's it . 741140_758640
*PAR0:	okay . 758640_759960
*PAR0:	&-um we so he's right now about seven and a half months eight months seven and a half . 759960_767800
*PAR0:	yeah seven and a half months . 767800_768580
*PAR0:	&-um so for me to get down here completely understandable . 768580_798920
*PAR0:	I was on the fence about this one . 798920_802500
*PAR0:	but my husband was like . 802500_803260
*PAR0:	come on it'd be so cool . 803260_804980
*PAR0:	I'm like . 804980_805280
*PAR0:	are you gonna drive him . 805280_806780
*PAR0:	it is cool though . 806780_811860
*PAR0:	I'm surprised . 811860_812600
*PAR0:	like how much you can get like that [/] that little testimony . 812600_815760
*PAR0:	how much you can kind of get from them . 815760_817240
*PAR0:	you know it's impressive that they like know stuff . 817240_822080
*PAR0:	although this time around like with the first time around I didn't give them credit I think for stuff . 822080_827840
*PAR0:	and this time around I'm like . 827840_828820
*PAR0:	oh he knows your name . 828820_829900
*PAR0:	and he kn you know you can kind of tell more . 829900_833700
*PAR0:	I think maybe because I realized with the girls after the fact like . 833700_838080
*PAR0:	oh they didn't't know that . 838080_839700
*PAR0:	and so now I kind of give them credit for it later . 839700_841240
*PAR0:	but sometimes it's hard . 841240_842980
*PAR0:	and it's really a judgment call is you know like what counts is knowing I mean because you're not you don't put them in a situation where you really test it . 842980_849800
*PAR0:	test it [/] it . 849800_850060
*PAR0:	what . 850060_850140
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah I know what you mean . 850140_853020
*PAR0:	right . 854420_855180
*PAR0:	like when daddy comes home . 855180_856200
*PAR0:	and he's excited . 856200_856780
*PAR0:	but I wonder too about like the gender bias stuff that like [/] like I think all the time like . 856780_883840
*PAR0:	oh he doesn't have any boy toys . 883840_885060
*PAR0:	we should get him boy toys . 885060_885860
*PAR0:	well should we or shouldn't we you know like . 885860_887520
*PAR0:	oh my goodness . 903300_905420
*PAR0:	it's just not good enough for biting . 905420_911720
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah . 911720_915540
*PAR0:	and he's a big orangutan I know . 915540_920740
*PAR0:	poor baby Max well we gotta leave the keys here . 920740_934020
*PAR0:	but you got a cool car to play with . 934020_938080
*PAR0:	okay . 938080_938920
*PAR0:	we'll take the mic back . 938920_939960
