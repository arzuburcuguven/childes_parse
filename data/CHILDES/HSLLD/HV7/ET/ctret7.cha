*INV:	now sir we have (.) one more good thing to do here .
@Comment:	Time is 21:48
@Comment:	MOT and Chi work moderately well together , although they are more antagonistic with each other than helpful. Still , a friendly atmosphere remained throughout the activity. A few short segments of activity and talk surround the idea of repulsion , though the word <repulsion , or repel> is never used. The experimenter remains in the distance , only commenting and laughing occasionally. MOT talks to another sibling. Video does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
*INV:	www .
*MOT:	www .
*CHI:	www .
%sit:	MOT talks to another sibling who is going somewhere; Chi asks if he can go too; EXP talks about the activity

*MOT:	&=laughs .

*MOT:	oh it [= orange or yellow ball] didn't do it [= referent unclear] .
*MOT:	wait a minute .
%act:	drops the orange ball on top of the yellow ball again; this time , the yellow ball moves out from under the orange ball and off the star
*MOT:	see ?
*MOT:	can't be together .
*MOT:	+^ watch .
%act:	with one ball in each hand , MOT puts the balls together; when Mot lets go , the balls roll away from each other

%act:	rotates the flat silver circle on top of the black base and on top of which sit the star and the orange ball

%act:	removes the wand quickly from the black base
*CHI:	(.) &=laughs [>] .
