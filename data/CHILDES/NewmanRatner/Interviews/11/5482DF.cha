*PAR0:	we do have lots of baby dolls . 54160_55520
*PAR0:	and he's been more interested in home than he was with this one baby doll . 55860_72820
*PAR0:	&-um hm he did like he picked this up for a second and like toss it aside . 72820_83960

*PAR0:	and the banging it seems like noise is more of a thing right now . 108700_111640
*PAR0:	and this he did this better like he actually could flip [/] flip the flaps a little last time . 112220_119840
*PAR0:	he couldn't really do that . 119840_120800
*PAR0:	not intentionally . 120800_128740
*PAR0:	I would say like that if we're playing I'll call it what it is but I'm not like flashcards or anything . 128740_134080
*PAR0:	yeah . 134080_134500

*PAR0:	&-um it's hard at home . 151020_156580
*PAR0:	he doesn't get lots of books . 156580_157860
*PAR0:	I've got twins that are three and a half . 157860_159560
*PAR0:	so they get like all the attention . 159560_160820
*PAR0:	but &-um so I think like he had a an overall better experience with the book . 160820_167680
*PAR0:	but he's generally playing with toys . 167680_169140
*PAR0:	so that's hard . 169140_169800
*PAR0:	yeah . 169800_171460
*PAR0:	&-um do you think you recognize the name of any of the objects we have here . 171460_176780
