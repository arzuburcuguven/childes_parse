i think he was planning on picking you up after the yard sale
wasnt he
you know what i thought we should get rid of
you know all your battery operated toys that -um
listen to me
let me make the proposal here
you have three
get rid of two
keep your favorite
they take up a lot of space in your room
they do honey and youre a big boy
you can keep one and really do just fine
its rude honey
you know the thing about getting up
you know your things
your dolphins and your monkeys and
whats the other one
two of those and keep one
honey you
i dont think you have one of those
oh i i think you do
well look at them
then weve gotta go through stuff in the basement
things say that you havent used in a year
and get rid of that stuff
well look at stuff
sorta sort of like when were at the movies or something

well you you have more time now since youre leaving later for school since its cold
so you have like half an hour more
i mean thirty five minutes

so you needta be concentrating very hard on bringing those grades up and working hard on your effort and
maybe march or maybe june
so i want you to really think when youre doing your homework
and im at school and youre trying to get your homework done i want you to really concentrate on the things we talked about at school yesterday like putting a little more effort into it
and proof reading your papers and double checking your math okay
at school
oh my god
what does the game teach you
is it like the oregon trail
the amazon
yeah thats not in our country
-um m but it sounds a lot like the amazon trail
i mean the oregon trail
you gotta keep albums and figure things out
so you needta be careful
didnt you have a diary or something you gotta keep
a journal or something like that
oh i thought you did
hey that star wars cd compact disc rom that you asked for
well see the thing is i already told the stores that you wanted it but i didnt check it out
is it nasty
is it like those dungeons and dragons
rebel assault
is that a star wars one
im surprised because it doesnt seem like star wars would be too violent
theres three
oh yeah
and she what
thats gross
well it cant be as bad as what i was reading about on the back of those -um dungeons and dragons games
my god that one called hacksand have you heard of that
convinced me to buy it at the computer store
my god i read the back of it and it was like your friendss dead corpses are everywhere
blood and gore spew
it was
well i asked whether it any of the d and d dungeons and dragons games were not so violent and they said theyre all violent
because i know jamie had looked for games for you too thats about adventuring but not you know with all the nasty blood and guts and all that so we havent been able to find one
cant you just stick to math blaster or something like like that
evil what
oh youre sarcastic
oh youre back again arent you toby lee
oh pet me mommy pet me
look at the way like when you pet her she like totally almost sits on you
youre a good dog
yes you are
no shes so tired this morning
you know were having our big christmas dinner this saturday and jen and martin are gonna come
for christmas dinner
not until the morning no
heres the thing
alright im gonna give them their present okay and if they bring any presents you can open them but you cant open any of the ones im giving you know why
because were just having a miniature christmas here at our house
im not getting you the five thousand presents i usually get you okay
down to florida
santas coming to florida
and its called your grandparents okay
thank god
see they can pay the bills in january
i know remember that one year when you went mommy why did santa leave the price tag on
oh my god
yeah you were always too smart for that santa thing
that santa gig
i know
well so anyway listen
hold on
well have -um
hold on i wanna talk about
well you know its gonna be on our computer
play sim iowa with him okay
no we already got regular sim city
no listen to me for a minute
-um do you have a present for jen and martin
well maybe you could either -uh buy something or make something before
you could make jen an ear ring
you know she loves your ear rings
i think she only has one hole in her ear
oh you could make her a pair
and then shell have two but i think that you should make them both something okay
-um maybe you can make him like a drawing
how about that
i know well go out to the pet store
well they are coming over
i doubt it
i called her invited her -um and i doubt it
it but she would love a pair of ear rings also
you know what the other thing is we ought to check in with the gallery and see how your ear rings are selling
i was wondering whether you had thought about that when you went downtown the other day
about popping in to see kathy and see how many of your ear rings have sold
-um i think itd be very good to check in before the end of the month
well you know were leaving
i think that yeah the gallery closes the day after we leave
so you do needta check in with her and just pop in and say this week
and then at the end of the next week youll be picking up whatever you havent sold which if you ask me i bet you sold all your ear rings
so i think that you should just pop in and say okay
sometime this week
maybe today maybe tomorrow after
after school or something you could take your ten bucks and -um go up to to casa de modo and look for something for martin and jen
you could just buy one thing to share if you wanna or you could make jen something and draw -um martin something
excuse me
i didnt call you go on i sneezed i didnt s say dear come here doggie
time after having all those cookies last night i think
oh three chocolate chip cookies
thats what i get when i go to grandmas house
her the whole cookie
sheesh ma
chi toby liked it though
lets go to barbaras and have cookies
cookies and cat water
no biting
go on
go find the kittie
go get the kittie
look at her she tips her head sideways and she says what go sleep in the laundry
what do you mean hop in the laundry basket
what do you mean
what laundry basket
which one
youre kidding me
are you making that up
she got in
what did she do
whatd she whack toby
i know because she has got a really mean growl
well why what did toby do in the laundry basket
shes bigger than the laundry basket though
a big german shepherd cant basket
she just stood in it she didnt try to lay down or anything
come here
youre a dingbat
come here
look at her the dog tip her head sideways
what did you do in the laundry basket huh
a crime
its a crime
in february in february itll be one year since we got her from the pound
one year
and shes still as goofy as she ever was
sit down and finish your tea
yeah i know i thought about that maybe we could just take her back and and say you know lets show them how good shes doing
im still gonna write a letter to them you know
but actually it might be better if we both wrote it or you wrote it
you know
yeah or i can on the computer and you could draw a picture
yeah thats a good idea
im loving it here at at mot and chis house because i get to eat a lot of cookies
i know
we all came home and threw up because of that
i kinda kind of got rid of them
yeah kinda kind of
no take some fruit to school today
thats because weve got like five more pounds of pears in the fridge
we have
a junk snacks no good for you
all the other kids
unhealthy and
do you have another
junk food is no good for you
it doesnt give you the good calories you need
hey was it only is miss lees class that she said no junk food for a snack
the other teachers let the kids bring junk food
miss melia doesnt care if you bring crap to school
well thats good of her
do some kids bring that everyday
cookies everyday
do they bring -uh home lunch or school lunch
well so they eat a lot of junk food thats not healthy
are you still -uh trading your school lunches
have they been any better lately or are they still nasty
no you would have got gotten the flu anyway
i know you dont like the school lunches but they didnt actually physically make you sick
you were getting the flu
they put meat in everything
well then we have to go back to making more
but if you were still trading
are you trading your school lunches for and jellies and stuff
from the school lunch
well then we needta making home lunches again
the problem is we cant afford to do that every single day because we dont enough money to buy that much food but we can certainly take a break you know from school lunches for a while
and send you with -um not just peanut butter and jelly but will you think about taking like -um rice and stuff like that to school
because if youre gonna be a vegetarian you know you have to learn to eat a and
no thats her food
-uh shes not eating
so we could make a salad like that and put cheese in it
that would be a very good idea
you would take a salad to school
wed better get the dog walked so you can get to school
well we gotta go food shopping today ill see what have okay
alright say
bye harvard

from chi
well first lets go through a mr caterpillar again
while youre doing that
so for years ive read it to you so now you can read it to me

the first thing we do is write
and a period after the
and now his name

so we will say what
we wanna tell him what we thought about the book so what words are we gonna say

you put the name of it
this is the name of the book
you gotta erase that
i really like your book mister eric carle
okay that can stay

you know what im saying
when i see a caterpillar crawling around outside i never say oh its going to turn into a beautiful butterfly
you just say yuck caterpillar
so we can tell him what we learned
we learned that
now let me
we learned that
a beautiful
not a
that a beautiful butterfly
the word
begin as a not
so beautiful look at the word
were gonna say not so beautiful caterpillar
see this right here
we never knew that a caterpillar could eat so much
gotta put a period
start up another sentence
go to the next line
your spelling word from the other night
you wanna start the
its gonna be too close to the never
that right there is like you got a new pair of shoes
the other is like a -um a sense of
okay never knew
we never knew that that
that a caterpillar
eat so much
and then i think we can just say thank you
thank you for a lovely story
you for a lovely
now you can say full name
and then you can read the letter out loud to us okay chi
okay now you can read it out loud
thank you
there you go
i think your book is fabulous because you describe it well
and i love caterpillars
i like how you wrote it
and i like your other books too
my name is chi
i have brown eyes
i am nine and a half and my shoe size is two and a half
my favorite thing is ballet
my favorite color is blue
i like climbing trees fishing swimming and school
i have one cat one dog and a bird
ps i think you should write about a dog and ballet
you guys can do it together
just whatever she
think about his book
write about it
how many books does he have out
he has a lot
does he
yeah he really does actually
a lot more than youd think
you want her to read
she can if she wants but its really up to her
some children just look at the pictures its
show how good you read
she can read me the letter afterwards though
want her to do a letter today
oh okay
just right here
im gonna do a couple other things while you guys do that so
that would be great
you can read it and then turn the pages
why dont you do that
because if you gotta write about the book you should refresh your me
i know you read it a lot though
you dont remember the whole book do you
you do
what does that say
a little egg on a leaf
you need to read it so you
she does know
wanna read it
now youre gonna write him a letter tell him what you think about his book
whatever you like
them to do cursive
the teacher has a good thing
i think its very nice
its called the the learning log
each kid has their own notebook
and part of their homework every week is to turn in their learning log
-um i dont know where
oh its in there on the couch
your bag
and they have to like refresh what they did for the week or
it could be about anything
outside activity or school something that they like do whatever and -um little comments -um about the holidays and then the teacher answers
she retakes them all home i guess over the weekend and she answers them
its kinda kind of nice
its like a one to one
and i think sometimes the kids can write stuff that they probably wouldnt say to her
so its a kinda kind of nice idea
i dont know if the other teachers do this
a lot of teachers do but they call it something different
and youll take it home
yeah and i thought it was nice
some people dont
nice writing
but she yeah she says to them on their homework assignments the learning log cursive please
i guess a lot of kids like to print
crybaby stop
stop being a crybaby
stop being a crybaby
its nice though and i like reading it
every couple of weeks ill pick it up to read it to see what she wrote and what the teacher wrote
she always has such nice things to say
she writes a lot
see what teachers do
you know what i mean
i mean im sure she takes all that home and reads each kidss book and answers them and sometimes she writes really long and thats time-consuming
theres twenty something kids
its tough you know like they say they teachers bring in their own stuff
im sure she chis teacher brings a lot of her own stuff in you know
for different crafts and stuff
parties whatever
oh shes kitten all full of electricity when i touch her i get shocked
good girl if youd stop crying so much
stop crying
just erase that part
see its right here
hm i know
she gets into everything
get down
if you werent here she kitten probably wouldnt even be out here
of course not
this is usually when shes sleeping
look at her kitten
yeah now i am
youre a baby arent you
it was funny when we had the other cat in the cellar and that ones full grown
it looks so big
and i said well ill open the door a crack and let them look at each other
but i said to her dont let that big one in
shell kill her
this was the one that didnt like the big cat
and i said oh my god
invading her territory huh
and then put a in front of that
write to the side of
they do a lot with story stuff in school -um
theyll have to do a story about something and sometimes the teacher she said at conference some of the kids will write like a few paragraphs but chis it just thered be like three or four pages
real descriptive and she said shes good in that area and shell read hers out loud in front of the class which is nice
maybe you could even write in a book someday huh
in between ballet classes
oh look caterpillars on there
oh its cute
whats down there a caterpillar
oh thats nice
maybe you can mention that you write books
is this the one taperecorder that youre gonna going to leave me
its all set
i know one time i made one mealtime tape and i waited forever
and i says to chi i dont think theyre ever coming back to get this
i think it was ellen
well that was there for a long time
if you still have them you can always give them to me
if you ever find it
oh no she did come back eventually for it
it was long time it seemed like a long time
were giving you this certificate also for -uh the tapes
one certificate to friendlys
oh thats nice
for doing that for us
because i know its a little bit of a hassle
sometimes usually when were eating though i always say to her dont talk with food in your mouth just eat quietly
then when we do these its like and shell go
a little bit yeah its a little much
isnt it awful about that crazy guy down in brookline with the clinic
he wants to get out of jail and be a priest they say
i know
i dont think cardinal moll would like to have him as a priest though huh
sad though huh
you just wonder what made us all like that
and now this morning i i was watching the news in -um new york because they went in this morning to open up their clinics as usual and there were signs plastered all over the place -um if you come near near the premises or go inside youre gonna going to be hurt -uh or murdered like in boston
its awful
and they were ripping down the signs
so theres threats everywhere
i wouldnt even wanna work in one of those places
i wouldve thought that he woulda would have went past the receptionist and went right out to the source the doctors
i mean not that would have been any better but i saw these poor one girl was only twenty seven and she had a fiancé and
its very sad
theres just no excuse for that
what are they gonna do
oh great
oh nice one
could you read that out loud for me please
thats great
to read it first and then write it

the job that involves the fact that spelling really does matter in life and you should pay attention to math
-um do you wanna tell him which book
just anything that looks like that
it doesnt have to be perfect
okay read me what you have with your letter so far
now when you write the very hungry caterpillar do you needta underline that or put it in quotation marks or anything
what does your teacher teach you about that
when youre writing the name of the book

why dont you read that out loud to me one last time
very nice
its up to you what do you feel more comfortable writing with
oh yeah
for my sister krista
i dont know
oh you know what i copied it from
-um petra another experimenter actually had a a small version
they have a like a hand held version of this book
oh yeah
so we copied it from that book
should we read it again
and do you remember it
wanna read it
yeah you could read it or look at it
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf
one sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar
im the one thats sposta pay attention
show me the pictures
he started to look for some food
oh yeah i remember
on monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry
on tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry
on wednesday he ate through but he was still hungry
on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was
on friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry
oh yeah on saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one icecream cone one pickle slice of
i guess
one slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon
that night he got a stomachache
the next day was sunday again
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better
now he wasnt hungry anymore and he wasnt a little caterpillar anymore
he was a big fat caterpillar
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself
he stayed inside for more than two weeks
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and he was a beautiful butterfly
okay so what do you what do you wanna say
didja did you like it
here y
whatever youre more comfortable with

very nice
nice job
okay you wanna look through it quickly again to remind ourselves
dear mister carl
my name is chi and i am nine and a half years old
i was wondering why there is only one character instead of two in the very hungry caterpillar
how do you draw and write all of this by your self
sincerely chi
i do
the very hungry caterpillar
mem weve seen some other books like this by him too in the store huh
i always point them out
for my sister christa
you want me to read it to you really quick
can you just look at it
so that we
have something to
so we have something intelligent to say
why dont i just read it through quickly okay
and you can just look
or do you wanna read it
can you remember what its about
tell me
tell me like as if i never read
egg laid on a leaf yeah
you do remember this
when he ate the leaf
he felt much better
im impressed
oh thats wonderful chi
beautiful butterfly
that was a beautiful -uh retelling too
well thank you
that helped me
i thought id do it quick for you and you did it quick for me
wow that was the whole thing
so lets see
-um so the first thing were gonna do is is write the date right
who are you writing to
do you wanna write that down
its august twenty third
and ninety five
and -um whats his name
dear mr carle
come on
put it down
youre youre writing wrong
y youre opening the letter and youre
youre writing to the author of the book right
so you write
thats right
very good
-uh dont make that all the way down so that comma
okay so w d what would you like to write to him
have you written to an author before in school
you have
and that was just recently
what -um kind of things did you find interesting when you did that
anything that you can think of there that that you might wanna do here
or you wanna try something different
ask him some different questions
okay what would you like to ask him about or talk to him about
would you like to tell him about the book
if you liked it if well you dont wanna write to him telling him you dont like it if you didnt
but i think you liked it anyway so
you know what you liked about it or what was interesting or how it reminded you of you
eating through those things or anything about it
so it reminds you of you except for at the end you dont get fat you just keep growing right
thats true
w so you wanna tell
do you wanna tell him about that
or would you like to ask him questions
it says by eric carle and i dont see an illustrated by so do you think he wrote i mean drew it also
mhm especially since theres no
thats true
you wanna wanna ask him about it
any questions
because it doesnt look like regular -uh crayons or markers does it
you wanna ask him about how he -um did the art work
because it almost looks like
somehow thats
yeah its painted here you can tell right all of this looks like finger painting
but right here see how its like a sharper cut almost looks like something was put on top of it doesnt it
would you be interested in
very good
yeah so what does it do
and over this
so whaddo what do you think
would you like to ask him about it
and how he did that or
any questions you might have
or maybe when he was a kid
what gave him ideas
do you think when he was a kid he was like you and me and threw everything like that
or that he was more like you to eat the junk food
or more like you to eat the fruits
i know its hard to think huh
-um hm hm what do you think youd like
w that gave him the idea
you wanna ask him how he got the idea
was it from when he was a kid or anything like that
hm you wanna ask him
i think thats a good question
why dont you start off saying that -um you read his book and b for quite a few years now
and -um
tell him that then
say you read the book ten times and you you were wondering if -um when he was a kid if he got the idea for the book from when he was a child or or or do you have any c caterpillars when he was a kid
or something like that
why dont you do that
why dont you write the first lines opening it saying that you youve enjoyed his book or youve read it ten times and you really like it
or something like that
what ideas
how could you say something in your own words
just to kinda kind of let him know that youre a a reader of his book and thats why youre writing him
instead of his friend who he he -uh hasnt heard from since third grade
why dont you say some things out loud what youre thinking in your head
maybe i can help you
why did it have to
that sounds like a scientific
you can do that one next
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself and stayed inside for
theres a clue
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out
but before see what happened on monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry
on tuesday he ate two pairs
on wednesday
thats everyday isnt it
well day he did that so he was eating every single day right
and then on saturday he ate all this
and then what happened
okay then sunday
so he was eating every
but then what happened
did he eat
what happened
to his eating s schedule
he suddenly
thats right
so maybe thats why he hadta get fat
so he could store up all the energy because now his body was using that for two weeks to feed itself
you know
as storage food so thats
well we we dont hibernate so
just once a day
see they do it for two weeks so thats why he needed all that storage
so that when he came out he didnt eat for two weeks youd be skinny wouldnt you
so at least hes still alive
so why dont you write that for a sentence -um something about you know who you are and why youre writing to him
or just like tell him who you are introduce yourself
we we have a hard time writing
so if you want us to s stop let me know because
oh no
go right ahead
youre doing just fine
yeah actually intra probably introducing yourself in the first line say who you are or and -uh why youre writing
dear mr carle
hm hm how about my name
a good beginning
no my name is
you could say how old you are or what grade youre in
-um can you remember
its been awhile
had a bad last year in school
try to remember how do you begin all sentences
well thats
because its different because its a letter
this is actually the beginning of a sentence
okay because this is u like addressing the whole thing and at the end you say you know sincerely comma chi
-um just like thats not a complete sentence the same with this
its the opening and closing of the letter
well because youre introducing yourself its waiting until the end
thats what the erasers for
i know
summers on
write write your full first name
draw a line here
and your last name
remember to make the capitals bigger than the the lower cases
physically bigger
so that you can tell the difference
the only thing that makes it upper or lower case is the size
right mhm
okay so so what you did so far
my name is chi
how about your age
and end on
then we can get it all in one sentence
n to tell you
no i was gonna say that after your name put a comma
and that would separate it
thats fine though
youre doing it good
are you trying to fit it all on one line
because you can go on
oh good
im nine and a half years
now does that sound like it would be a good place for the period
w why dont you read it first just to make sure
did that sound like a good place for a period
to end it
what did it sound like
does it sound like a complete sentence
let me let me read it to you
see how it sounds to you
or sounds like its its not finished
dear mr carle
my name is chi and i am nine and a half years old
y yeah i think thats good
and what now youve introduced yourself and he has an idea who who you are
-um what do you wanna say to him or ask him
something about more introducing why youre writing to him
like ive read your book since he wrote all these other books too
it says in here
see he wrote these other books
so it might be helpful to him to know what book youre writing about
you can say ive ive read you book the very hungry caterpillar
this is just about publishing
these are the books you have
about him
its not
that would be a good -um let me let me see
no wait a minute
it doesnt have it on this book but thats a very good idea
if you wanna write to somebody is read about him because thatll be very interesting as well as if youre interested in writing to him
youre right that would help
a lot
but it doesnt tell about him
maybe thats what youre gonna have to write
ask about him
say i looked for the paragraph that tells about you but i couldnt find it
so that you can ask him the questions
i dont know
good question
do you think he he played with these caterpillars when he was little or he liked them
is he the type of kid who liked to play with these and
why dont you
how could you say that a little bit -um more succinctly
w with fewer words like hm
thats a good question
try to think of a way that we could say it without it being -um so many words but the same question
c could try writing that
well well think about w what were you getting at
what was the point of what you just said
you wanted to know when what
as an adult
or as a kid
okay so make sure you get that in there
you wanna tell him about that you you read this book
because the other -um books he wrote in here theyre not all about animals
or insects
maybe you wanna tell him its that this is the book that you read
and after you read it you were wondering whether
go ahead write it down chi
write it down
put it down
in what
hes got all these books
do you think you should start like a new paragraph
okay how about saying i was wondering or something like that
instead of just like how come
kind of abrupt
you wanna
you dont want him to to like think that youre going whats wrong with that book right
because thats not what youre doing no how come there isnt
but you wanna wanna be make sure that he knows youre being polite and youre not kind of being critical right
one character
how about i was wondering why there is only one
is that okay
course the way you said it was more succinct
defeats the whole point of what i was saying
what do you what do you think
ill help you if you really need it but try it first because youve been a little bit rusty from the summer
see that
i was wondering
why is or why
wait a minute
i was wondering why
i was wondering why
what about i was wondering why there is only
switch the ther and
what you know youre right because its why is there but
alright put if you put put a comma or a semicolon after
i was wondering and then is more if theres more of a pause its its sort of like -um y youre not beginning a new sentence but it separates the two
its like youre saying i was wondering why is there only like that
what are you gonna do
d do you like the sound of that though
my my heads doing flips right now
i cant decide
so like what you wanna do is listen to the sound of it and see if it sounds right to you
now do it the other way
which one sounds better to you
which one feels right
okay then do it that way
hes german
its a german
so its probably a german -uh lo a grammar sound
its a good point though
i dont know if originally was from a german word or not but well have to learn that another time
okay we have char and then what does it sound like
if youre not sure you can ask
oh i think the and then
yeah it doesnt always sound the way it looks
it does sound more
talk about rusty my
that doesnt mean anything
-uh instead of two
wait whaddwe what did we
-um is -um
so an between
o u opposite
y yeah theres not much room you have to erase the
instead of two
i just wanna point something out to you
i obviously hes gonna get the letter and its gonna going to show a picture of his butterfly and caterpillar
but -um listen to it and what do you what do you think is kind of missing a little bit
dear mr carle
my name is chi and i am nine and a half years old
i was wondering why there is only one character instead of two
i know but he sees that hell probably figure out but does something sound funny like somethings missing
if you would just
if you were him and you got a letter from somebody that said my name is chi im nine and a half years old
i was wondering why theres only one character instead of two
would you know what chi was talking about
which book
because remember he wrote all these books
which book
because he wrote all these
see the honey bee and the robber
well obviously that has two characters
because its right in the title right
so he might say well gee i have two characters
i wonder what he means
so you wanna tell him what book you read right
what your book youre referring to
so i was wondering why there is only one character instead of two in your book the very hungry caterpillar
did you say his book
very hungry caterpillar
-uh yeah i do not know dont know
let me let me see
i was wondering why theres only one character instead of two
you put yeah if you wanna leave it you can
what you d do is read the sentence when youre done and then decide if it you need a comma there or not
in y your book
oh youre writing the
you could do it either way
you could say in the hungry very hungry caterpillar or in your book the very hungry caterpillar
which ever way you wanna do it
make sure that is big enough right there
and i think you underline the title
is that right
yeah it is but usually what you i wanna do is separate it because its its the title of something
so its its more important in in some ways than the rest of the the words in the sentence it it makes it stand out as something separate
now the only question here is that you want a period or a question mark
because the way you wrote it you could do it either way
why dont you read it and see what it sounds like
you want that one
okay -um what else do you want
you know i think you can put a semicolon there
and th that would make more sense with the
a dot and then a comma
i dont know if its exactly correct but
yeah you kinda kind of separate it
i was wondering and youre starting over again
why is there only and thats a real obvious question
why is there only one character is a question
whereas i was wondering why there is only one character you could just put a period there
so okay then what else do you wanna write
dear mister carle
my name is chi and im nine and a half years old
i was wondering
i was wondering
why is there only one character instead of two in the very hungry caterpillar
do you wanna ask him about what when he was a kid
that what we were looking for to find out about him when you were looking for the the part that he read wrote about him and stuff
because like doesnt that look like the this is the paper glued together
mm okay what what do you wanna write
what do you what do you wanna know
well do you think that its really something that he needed to
if you think about it obviously he was just looking for it and he probably just found it somewhere right
i mean its a book for y for younger kids not older kids
so do you think y the younger kids are gonna be really interested in exactly where he found each food
or they just kinda kind of skip that and theyre in going through it
how about how does he decide to what to leave out and what to put in the stories
do you wanna ask him that
like like how does to leave out the part about where exactly they found the peach and what about these other fruits orange
and the fruits how did he decide it wasnt important what to leave out and what to put in the story
is that a question you have
because he just started to look for food and then he ate through it
well is there something youre wondering like how did he make that decision
the caterpillar
well do you think that it the author was really thinking about what where he was gonna find the food or do you think he was just trying to make it a little bit interesting
i mean maybe one caterpillar might never find anything but apples
you know another caterpillar might not find any of these but find something different and thats all they ever eat but where hes writing a book dont dont you think that he probably wasnt concerned about that part
he just skipped that
just like in cartoons animals talk but they dont in real life
but the animator doesnt really think about how did they learn to talk
they just jump over that
so thats probably what happened here
why dont you ask him about when he was little
if he liked -um caterpillars or
something like that
good question
-um how about starting with like a new paragraph
and indent
well and if you want you can try you know erase that indent a little
you can indent here
how did you get the idea for your stories or
how did you make up the story
did you like caterpillars when you were little
or did your mother say you eat too much junk food like my mother says or something like that
how would you like to say it
you mean where did he get the ideas
so how did he know what to do once he had the idea
that what you mean
like you have ideas too
and how did he know to put it into a book and make a nice book out of it
its a good question
hm how can you say that
what would be the way to a ask that in a sentence
okay we wrote you wanna know about ideas
what hm -um
why dont you write that
how did you
mhm how did you
n y indent it a little
okay good
is that a statement or a question
and you wanna ask him about when he was little
if he played with insects
and scared little kids with them or anything
or if he ate too much junk food when like you
you know what
were gonna needta kind of go ahead with the the other stuff
this is really great
-um but maybe you can kinda kind of wrap it up
how do you wanna end it
do you wanna ask one more question
well just like you began it
you wanna end it in a similar way
how about -uh hm let me see
re let me read it to you
so youll see that its the whole thing
or you wanna read it to me
when you finish it
dear mr carle my name is chi and im nine and a half years old
i was wondering why is there only one character instead of two in the very hungry caterpillar
how did you draw and write all of this by yourself
sincerely chi
or thank you
or what
come on
you need a capital
and then underneath it write your name
and if you wanted to do your abbreviated name now you could
dear mister carle
how did you get the idea of the book
i like the part when he eats all the junk food on saturday
my mom would never let me eat all that junk food
thank you for a very enjoyable story
sincerely chi and mot
and ill give you about you know ten minutes or so to do that
need a pencil
oh yeah
thatd help huh
you can look at the book if you needta
to refresh your memory
did it the taperecorder stop
yeah there we go
i know what are you what you gonna write
exclamation point
thank you for a very enjoyable
a very enjoyable story
thats a right
just erase that part that makes it look like a
good spelling
you all done
you wanna read it
oh thats great
thanks chi
youre all set with that
so we made paper for you to use
dear mster eric carle
ive been reading your book for years
the harvard university people came with your book
the caterpillar must be full of all that junk
i like the book because he eats all that stuff
he was a pretty butterfly
i live in massachsetts too
good job on doing your book
sincerely chi
do you like to write with a pen or a pencil
dont you think pencil in case you make a mistake
here it is
lets see
this lights better
you could tell mr eric carle that youve been reading his book
ive read your book a lot
dear mister i think would be appropriate
no for
no not
that would be mrs miss mccormick or thinking of
is mister
youre writing very pretty
ive been reading your book for years
he did
he wrote that
theres a little apostrophe in ive
well do you wanna tell him why youve been reading the book for years from the harvard university study people
not because you like it
they made me
they made me
ah you could write whatever you want on that
the harvard university
should i be helping him
thats fine
however for you guys
how about the harvard university -um students -um come to to my house every year with this book
and and then you could say something nice about the book
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf
remember the egg on the leaf
thats correct
sound it out
you got it
youre a student correct
-um no
actually im not but
oh okay
thats okay
the harvard university people
one sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar
he started to look for some food
am i sposta read the book to him or is he going to read it me
its however you wanna do it
we bring the book along basically f as a refresher and if you feel like reading it thats great
-um if you dont needta you dont
if you wanna read it
its really up to you
he started to look for some food
on monday he ate through one apple but he was still very hungry
the harvard university people
well you have to use your own thoughts now
i got you started
start read it from the beginning
so you can get your thoughts going
the harvard university people came with your book
pe period
arent they coming back every year
no just do whatever you wanna
just do it the best you can
however you think
lets get going
holy cow
one monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry
on tuesday he ate through two pears he was still hungry
the caterpillar
on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry
four strawberries
five oranges
oh my goodness look at him
everything he ate huh
i know
that night he had a stomachache
this is cute
the next day was sunday again
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf but after that he felt much better
he chi put the caterpillar must be full of all that junk
its true
its very true
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself
he stayed inside for more than two weeks
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon and pushed his way out and
he was a beautiful butterfly
oh he is beautiful
you have to -um
put a couple more thoughts down and then finish it off
so its a a complete story that you wrote
like a complete letter
thats what the teachers tell my kids
that they should elaborate more in their writing
hard though
i mean i think its hard
kind of
now put what you think or what you like about it or what you dont like
and this is eric carle
thats what he looks like
this book
i think ive read it five hundred times

thanks chi

dear eric carle
i really like the drawings you did in your book the very hungry caterpillar
i liked the story too
my favorite part is when he turns into a butterfly
i also like the way you made holes in the pictures to look like he ate the food
love chi
so -um
thats pencil pretty sharp
so take about ten minutes or so
do you wanna look at the pages dear
you writing letters
good boy
and ill check
all set
that looks great
wanna read it
if you like
good going
thats wonderful
thank you
thats terrific
do you write a lot of letters chi
you did that
well were gonna send that to him
and -um theres a pencil or a pen
dear mister carle
i liked your book the very hungry caterpillar
i really enjoyed how he ate all the food on saturday because its all stuff that i like except swiss cheese
i also liked how he was small than very big
next will you write a book called the very hungry butterfly
sincerely chi
you can use whichever one you want
alright and take about ten minutes maybe
or however long it takes you while i kind of look through this stuff
yeah well would you like to -um take a quick look look through the book so it sort of refreshes your memory
you can read it to me and then you can refresh my memory too
he liked variety huh
so what do you really like about that story
isnt it funny it didnt occur to him that if he didnt just eat through it if he ate around and around maybe he wouldnt have been so hungry
okay so if you gonna write a letter to eric carle what would you say about his book
is that all stuff that you like
what would have been your favorite day
you dont like strawberries i thought
thats saturday
he kinda kind of did what i tell you to do all the time
huh you dont eat you dont grow
he ate
so how would you start this letter
or dear mr carle you think
mhm thats a good start
move for your paragraph
have enough light
and what do you think you like about it the best
i like the way all of a sudden he was very big
so would you like to do
would you like to write
was that your favorite part
that you really liked the way he ate through everything on saturday
you liked all the things he ate through on saturday
try to think of a way to form it in a sentence
or you can
think close your eyes visualize
-uh nope
how do you do you
okay thats it
close your eyes
thats right
whaddo what do you say are you gonna tell me what youre writing
what were those things
ate the
different food yeah
yeah its your basic processed meat
a health food
yeah if you take a look i would say saturday was a junk food kind of day with the exception of the watermelon
well its okay
not good but its okay
do you do you think that would give you a stomachache too
but look at his size right
you know you have to think of things proportionately
if you were
yeah why
hm yeah but you like cheese
cheese doesnt give you a tummy ache
thats usually only when you go to sleep car though
and then you say pull over right now mom
and he isnt kidding
so on sunday he ate -um the green leaf and it made him feel better
so that huh
and he wasnt hungry anymore
so you really enjoyed how he ate all the food on saturday
because it was such a big variety
and it was all stuff that you liked
okay well you can add that
that you you enjoyed how he ate all the food on saturday because it was all stuff that you like
you wanna read to me what youre writing
close your eyes and visualize
yeah easy word
im not telling
and your going wild with your capitals
that should be lower case
do you live on the first floor or the second floor
very nice
second floor
-um im sorry
i like except
okay close visualize
spell it for me
hm almost
no the part was good
thats the part
lets see
these words are up here
you just have to think about them
long word
its one of those words that twists
so -um all stuff that i like except swiss cheese
is there punctuation missing here anywhere
thats one
because its all stuff i like except swiss cheese
is that all one flowing thing
okay alright
did you love the way he was suddenly big
did you love that
you didnt love it
what part did you love
well you liked that part
but weve done that been there move on
what else
lets get back to the letter
alright so you can start a new paragraph
wh how -um suddenly he was very big
small then
okay thats really nice
so what do you think you would write a book about next
well why dont you
i like that
killer killer caterpillar
you wanna ask him that
if hes gonna come out with the very hungry butterfly
okay and how you wanna wai word that
or next will you write a book about the very hungry butterfly
say that one more time im sorry
thats correct yes
its a long word but its a easy word if you visualize it
you dont have to copy it
so -um whats the punctuation at the end of that sentence
out loud
thats right
and then you would sign it right
how do you end your letters
thats when you do a valentine you put
remember that other word
spell it
close your eyes
hm no almost
close that was pretty good
thats kind of a tough word
you can sign your name cursive
very good
then big
only time will tell
so heres a pencil and heres some paper and heres we brought the book along if you wanted to refresh your memory
so and you know if you wanna a ask your mom for help or whatever go for it
i need this taperecorder on you instead of me
theyll the transcribers have fun listening to that
i think so
you know christa
no just like the name
skinnier than an acorn
what did you write
wanna read it
here its a nice long letter
good chi
thats a nice letter
lets see if you can -uh so you can refresh your memory on what it was
dear eric carle
i like your illustrations in your books
i like the very hungry caterpillar catch the ball watch out a giant
my favorite part is when he eats the food
and get a stomachache
from chi
what we would like you to do today is to -um write a letter to eric carle who is the author of this book
-um and we made this attractive -uh paper your very own stationery for you to write with it
what youre going to be doing is writing a letter to the author the man that wrote the book
lets see if this pen works
do you like writing with pen
if i find a pencil ill give it to you
whats his name author because
here hold the book
if you chi need help just ask
you usually say how do you spell this how do you spell that
he has a problem with -uh phonetic section too
well i think its also the school
they have a new approach to it
and the new approach in my opinion
is a
you remember that book
what would you write him a letter that you
did you needta write read the book again and write it
or did you needta just tell him that you liked his book
wanna tell him that you liked his book
or do you needta read it t to refresh your memory
well did he do the illustrations
did he
-uh its a man
oh yeah -uh
yeah you guys have the same first name
yeah he has neat drawings
theyre very like mystery like
yeah thats okay
-um im not taping you yet i was just getting it ready
but thank you
so they call him up to nine is that the deal
you sound a lot worse
and i feel much better
-um this is our last home visit with you
next year see at school
what do you wanna do
is that something for him to do
i le aha i le str sh uns
can you see how it sounds illus strations
i always se sounded it out do you know what i mean
there are illustrations in your book
youre gonna write tell him what book first he might have other ones
you have to be specific you might think you know what youre conveying but he might not
like the teacher will say write nine word sentences
hell go the sky is blue
i mean
no depth to it you know what i mean
im like explain yourself more
well he c cant read thoughts
he he he cant read thoughts
right but not
but not
excuse me
in your book
in your books
and the name of this book is
all these years
congratulations you must have studied pretty hard for that huh
well good
thats good hard work pays off huh
sounds like your chest
a lot of people have upper respiratory difficulties
he chi got over it
-um you dont have a
some books have a cover on it and it will tell you some other books he has written but i dont know if that one does
it would be there it would be on the first pae i before the book starts
theres a little page
lets try the next page
-uh i
no no
i think that tells you the publisher
mar m make sure you put periods and commas in there when you needta
make sure your sentences arent like really long
do you have a cat
oh really
thats okay
actually you know what sometimes you get a little nervous of the pen because you think -uh i cant make mistakes and you cant erase
so i should have brought a pencil sorry
he -uh he was evaluated last year
and he and has he like been exercising his quarters
hell just come along and
yeah he exercises and he works with an ot
thats true
mine is fsh sound meaning her hand writing is bad
mines terrible too
im glad -uh
especially when i take notes in school i try to read them over and i say ah
its your letter
how do spell
fav or it
sound it out
chi im not going to be behind you all go back to school
you gotta sound things out
you want more what
oh gotcha got you gotcha
because this is like
its just not him theres a lot of kids
they have a new phonetic way of approaching things
they dont
in his school it just seems like they dont address things to kids like in the first or second grade they didnt address long short ay sounds
so its harder to detect
like a soft and
so i think he has a real hard time with that
when he eats the junk food right
all the things youre not sposta eat
i dont really believe in stigmatizing labels and stuff but -um
but then the whole word goes together
so what you should do is put a hyphen there
so you know the whole word goes together
oh sorry
-um i did a core
for first grade
it comes back everythings normal within normal limits
and i just didnt see it because i could see he was struggling and having difficulties
and then i did an evaluation on my own
it took some time because it takes so long to get an appointment
and now i just had a team meeting with his third grade teachers who said to me you know hes awfully fidgety
he cant keep still hes having a hard time being focused
its like i have to literally talk to him all the time
well i says excuse me but are you aware that he has add
she wasnt aware of it
i i told the teacher in his the team
i said excuse me but i think this is an administrative issue
i said i clearly had it diagnosed
and i said this is obviously a miscommunication here
because she was like saying to me how irritated she was with it
and she obviously doesnt have a kno lot of knowledge to it
right youd be more sensitive to it
so lets see what you write chi
how did you sign it
-um and the first task that id like you to do is a letter writing task
dear eric carle

we give you two sheets of paper but you dont have to use all the two sheets
we just give people in case they wanted to write a lot but just write as much as you

put the folder on like this
and then put some of the
see if they still stick
this sticks
do they stick
i didnt think they would
look how loud cousin
does your hand break it
thats cool
youre making it move
mr magico
oh yeah right
so in some why in some ways your hands not breaking it you know
because it still can move it
think you can put all of it there
is it moving
you may have figured it
its on videotape
this is a videotape
in the big one
well theres two ways
chi give me one this
you dont think you can
the world would be a different place
it would be the revenge of the little guy
hm maybe i should live in the world of little magnets
very nice
oh okay
oh do they now
well i dont know where we got that one
the orange orangutan
is that all the rage
ill show you the tape
chi can i try
think so
whats the magnets in
well this must have a magnet on it right
because all this stuff sticking it to it
see if the penny sticks
these things referent unclear i cant even pry them referent unclear off
see if this plastic turtle will stick to the magnet black base
is this yellow wand a magnet in here
what happens
oh yeah
what happens if you put the yellow yellow wand on top of the mirror flat silver circle
get that plastic turtle out of the way
oh yeah
here try this one blue ball
turn it yellow wand over
turn that the yellow wand over
turn it this way
see see if you can stick it yellow wand on there the silver circle on top of the black base
try to press it yellow wand down on there the silver circle on top of the black base
see if you can do it make yellow wand stick to the silver circle on the black base
see if you can force it the yellow wand down onto silver circle on black base
how about that silver stick
can i
chi look
no mom
hey guys
if both sides of yellow wand are magnetized
say ah
see i dont know why that what the principle is
does this one small rectangular piece got a magnet on it
try that one small rectangular piece
put it the black base in the middle of chi mot and bro
but these the balls have magnets in it
but you can kind of feel it yellow wand pushing them blue ball away a little bit
try it
part of its repulsion because its
can i try now
i dont know
which ones yellow wand or the black base more powerful
like if one any magnet was stuck on here black base that one yellow wand wouldnt be able to pick it magnet up right
chi ill try it
put nut on there black base
cant get that one silver stick off of black base
aw this is gonna
i was gonna say see if this yellow wand will pull it nut off of black base
but i dont think it yellow wand will
can i try
maybe because you tapped it black base
one of those marbles red ball is under it black base
it sticking the yellow wand to the nut made the light go off
oh cool
hey bro
do you wanna
come on
get off i say
it magnetic force does
it magnetic force does
see even through the penny it nut still like a little bit
oh look at you picking up all that stuff
do you feel it magnetic force just from the other side
i cant tell
no stop it throwing
stop it
stop it
you guys
get off i said
no ill do it
like that
yeah but thats its magnetic force going through it purple side of the purple magnet
im all done
whatever it purple star is
is this purple star a magnet
this thing purple star
oh yeah
this two flat triangles a magnet
if this black base will repel it purple star
it means like push it back

oh god youre not gonna do me on that are you
good just get the hands
actually i dont play with magnets
i dont remember this magnets at all
you dont
i dont think we had this magnets
this silver stick will not stick
does this plastic sheep stick
doesnt stick
none of these plastic pieces do
turtle stick yeah
like a circus
i wonder if this purple star would knock it tower of magnets over
nope it purple star goes the other way
now do you remember them magnets
yeah you were a little kid then
flat silver circle lying on the black base is
very powerful
nope its yellow wand not doing it making the silver man move any more
yeah look at the the -um
see hes washer attached to silver man
when you do it move the wand back and forth
oh yeah
it referent unclear must be going through the referent unclear down there
easy to clean up huh
it le
there goes the guy washer
this ones flat silver circle lying on base stronger
thats why
no wait
you mean you put them magnets in the pile all on top of each other
i dont know what you mean
guys silver men
lets see
when you put some of them nuts on it makes it purple star
oh no i guess its purple star not doing it
the power is going out of it purple star
this one purple star repels
remember this activity
what do you what do you mean
oh you go ahead
i dont know what youre talking about so
youll have to because i dont know what youre talking about
stack just the guys silver men
what do you what do you mean
oh you go first
oh hes silver man not gonna there base without you
its base repeling against him silver man
i thought you werent sposta use your hands
oh i see
rules change as it gets more difficult right
stack it magnets up on here base magnet
i know
oh well
yup right next to me
hm like this
think it silver stick the surface
i know everything
hm nope
oh now its tower of magnets
you can put him silver man on top
yeah its like the circus
oh time for bed
the right idea chi
see what you do
then put one of these silver stick
cant get it silver stick off there base
balance on it silver stick
okay you silver man can go upside down
wheres the other one silver man
no more guys silver men
there it silver stick is
lets see
if we can get this one silver man off
the ball in the middle
where that referent unclear goes
not going to go on there
oh yeah
they balls really are floating
wow thats tower of magnets neat
it referent unclear just likes
well that was pretty cool chi
oh youre doing one magnet at a time
hm nice
kind of
not really
a little bit
yeah thats silver stick gonna be hard
lift up on it silver stick
then it silver stick would come
hm im in
oh there you go
well you know what sir im running low on -um batteries
and im just gonna tape your hands on this
lets see if i can get this thing
what do you want her to do with that
the two of you can play with it
make stuff
whatever you want
is that a regular camera
its it is a little tiny camcorder
with legs and stuff
oh i just put this on the baby tripod so i dont have to hold it
oh thats nice
are you gonna take it all apart
that looks like a little man
make something
why they doing that
theyre doing it to
to look at the interaction and also to -um see the different ways that people play with this particular -um object
and theyll know all about us
they will not know about you
they might know a lot about the magnets though
god this comes out too
where you wanna put this
kinda kind of neat
where are you gonna put this referent unclear
theres another one there
kinda kind of neat huh
these silver magnet balls are like gum balls
throw them the world
a cry baby in the film
thats crybaby what we were gonna name him cat
put this washer on his silver man neck
trying to make it hold the stick
its fun to work with magnets
thats one thing i never got her
whole bunch of magnets
that one should come
this plastic turtle sticks
no that plastic turtle doesnt stick
are you out of your mind
close up with her
now what are you gonna do
chi dont put it cat there on the table
just go dont put it cat down
nice picture by the way
these ball magnets dont stick to that horseshoe magnet
these ball magnets dont stick to that horseshoe magnet
they ball magnets stick to this black base
does this blue plastic teddy bear stick
put that one blue arrow magnet down there referent unclear
i dont know
its cool cold huh
put this silver stick down
in there
one of these silver stick
theres another one silver stick
put the man on the top
do it that way
put it silver man over here
oh there you go
shes cat saying oh somethings rolling
ill get in on it
fun huh
make a lot of different designs
look like gumballs
i like these silver men
i like those referent unclear
no cat
can you put these silver men on
cats in the study
whats the matter
are you gonna cry
she the cat likes those balls
doesnt come after me
heres one
do what
do it one the other side
the other sides the magnet
on both sides
that the magnet
they silver sticks stand up
do it on that side and then put them silver sticks on that
then put the sticks in
put another stick in that one washer
then put the men on top of the stick
then put the men on top of the stick
call her cat and shell go
cry baby
whats the matter
whats the matter
she says i like all those things
i could play with all them on the floor
made a house
think magnets are a boys toy chi
i always thought they were a boys thing
when i was little
cry baby has decided thats it
want me to move her
oh no
thats okay
there she cat goes
is that your timer over there
you can take those out chi
the essay
do you learn about magnets in school
so you cant tell me how they work
look at this orange and silver magnet balls
theyre magnet balls sticking already
am i sposta wait until you take everything off
looks like something youd see at the science museum
feel how strong that is
wanna make it silver ball move
these plastic magnet balls must be magnets inside
you still have more
i dont wanna see that nickel going in your pocket now
were saving for florida
any dollar bills
cant use magnets on those huh
did you feel how strong it is
when it black base pulls
does it horseshoe magnet pick up the money
who does this silver man look like
doesnt it
do they silver men stand up
they will not stand up on the magnet huh
why he pulls it down on all this
oh hes silver man hanging on the bolt
yeah honey
just think
if you could pick up all your toys like this when it was on the ground id be set
thatd make cleaning easy
oh its plastic teddy not
i think theyre throwing those things in to trick us
does the arrow go
doesnt it blue arrow magnet feel like it would be a magnet and it arrow magnet would stick
brian would like him plastic turtle
so whats not sticking that we have
moneys not sticking
how come theyre yellow and blue checked magnets and they dont stick
all those magnets
just by a thread
i like the balls
oh wow
can you make it go further
oh how about this washer
can you make it washer go through the table
in the ba
oh cool
maybe glass is a little thick
what about this ball silver ball
look at that red plastic ball
its just
how close does it black base have to
where you going
do you know what
how come you took the good magnet horseshoe magnet with you you
simple science
they show the magnet thing in here
what does it say
is he
hes goofy not trying to pick up the sandwich is he
does it book tell you how they magnets work
or why they magnets work
oh look they book characters have a paper clip too
up here
hold your magnet several inches away from the paper clip
slowly move it closer
until snap
paper clip jumps over to the magnet
it works
works with the safety pin too
oh here it goes
a magnet will pick up something made of iron or steel
wheres the
lets see like which one will not itll take
go ahead
you do it
you got the stronger one
making it dance
you know what
im gonna
its been about ten minutes
what you gonna do with any of this
this like -um you know men silver men little men
you can take all that junk objects in the plastic box out of the box
-um its black base like a big magnet
i think that i might have given it to you upside down
i think it black base might be upside down
then it black base might
not that it side of the black base makes a huge difference
yeah it does make a huge difference
there you go
very powerful huh
what is inside of here box which contained the silver men
thats standing silver man kind of cute
like what
here this is
leave that people silver men sitting there on our basketball arena
any ideas
this magnets is very powerful
i dont know what this magnet set is all about
im not sure
you can build things with it magnet set
you could play hockey
like this
ive had enough of this game magnets
whats this yellow wand
well that red lego piece does not magnetic
that red lego piece is not magnetic
now this referent unclear is
look at this box
and it all objects belongs together huh
it all belongs together
should put some of this
very powerful magnet black base here
something like that another silver stick
its nuts too heavy
too heavy
too heavy
thats silver man and stick structure a nice thing that we made right here
wonder what this flat red lego pieces stuck together is for
i know you could take it apart
thats silver man tower cute
there it tower goes
that flat round checkerboard magnet doesnt do nothing
what this referent unclear is for
catch on to this yellow wand
you could see that this yellow wand -um
can have many effects
oh feel that magnetic force as the wand nears magnetic objects or the black base
feel that
and youll see the strength of it yellow wand
go slowly and youll see
then you can put it yellow wand on
is that enough
thats fine
so you can do whatever youd like with it magnets and say whatever you want
little guys silver men
oh my
what are you doing
daddy can i do it hold the yellow wand
no you cant
theres some of like forces there so maybe they dont attract
see the force that can move this one thin circle magnet around
we have a what here
oh an act
this is your circus act
oh look
-uh right here
excuse me
-uh steel will not attract steel
they have the same -uh
look chi
tadah you got it silver stick with the nut on top to stay
you should try and get the star purple star magnet on and see
what what did you ask
yeah it that paper clip did
and you add two two paper clips
theres a force in the magnet
a like force and unlike forces
one will attract
one will re repel
see like forces chi
watch what they like forces do
they like forces repel
they like forces dont wanna come together
so its a strong force right there between the ball and the wand
theyd like to run away
they wand and ball dont wanna stay together
its force between ball and wand the same force
if you turn it yellow wand on the other side they wand and ball attract
come together
now you can push it red ball away because its the same force
good job
youre gonna try it making a tower with the
well thats thats a nice job you guys
well not al all our predictions are always true
i said not all our predictions are always always correct
well thanks you guys
you did a great
what what are you gonna do
the sentries
go for it
i see
why are you knocking it silver stick down for
pretty strong magnet black base
come on man silver man be here on top of a stack of washers
pretty neat
what do we do with this red flat lego pieces
oh this yellow wand must be a magnet too
look at that
turn it wand around this way so that the other side of the wand is closer to the objects
ah okay
turn it wand
turn it wand
metal in there red ball
everythings piled on it black base
you can make a circus
didnt work
try standing these guys silver men on each other
will it standing the silver men on each other work
oh bravo
like this
how high can you go with it tower of nuts
just be careful putting them washers on
oh well
and it all came tumbling down
the walls came tumbling
oh its silver man on the tower of nuts is bat -uh bat acrobat
it falling of the tower wasnt my fault
there you go
it falling of the towers was your fault
you can call it even
hes silver mans here
well you know what dear
my arms getting tired
magnetized stuff
theres another cone
just play with them however you want
i love those
look where we gonna be on
just your hands
well ill ill put your face on it
just because i wanna see you you
first they got this great big magnet piece right here
unhunh wait a minute
lots of pull
there you go
why dont we just kinda kind of like throw it and see how many we can
you can keep it close to you if you want
closer and
there you go
yeah maybe we can throw up in the
right away like
look at that
oh look
i got another man
no leave him whichever way he fell
get the other man
there he silver man is laying down by the turtle
can you get it to stand up
put it silver stick on top of his silver man head
the bears sitting on the turtles back
id like to see that in real life
its not magnetized
a penny isnt
see that when one thing get on something magnetized and it magnetized to it make other things magnetize to it
what i was trying to do before was try to get this silver stick
and pick up the little round magnet
but once i got the guy silver ball off with the big magnet black base
i realized
its silver ball not magnetized
its silver ball only magnetized when its silver ball on this black base right here
then its silver ball magnetized
stay on
he silver man said that was too much for him silver man to hold
round one
thats a big one
one more minute
now set it up and we will have both of them carry this money
this one silver man
here put the nickel up there
on top of him
now put the dime
then well put the penny up right there
put the other penny
right here
right here
put the dime up there
put a man on each side to help just in case
wheres another man
oh hes up there on top of all of them
these things
see these guys
know whats doing that
oh thats how you do them
lift your hands up
those ones silver men are magnets too
wanna try and make a pyramid
with those silver men maybe
it magnetic ball will not stay up there
put one nut here
can you get it paper clip
ah i dont think its penny gonna stick
itll referent unclear stay on if you touch it
oh these green triangle magnet can go on it too right
this way
oh theres two bars silver sticks here
its silver sitck sticking on all the other ones nuts and silver men on black base
oh it silver stick will not stay upright though
im knocking down everything
why doncha dont you try this
and have something on there it
i dont think theyll magnet balls stay up there on silver stick but maybe we can do this
oh it yellow magnet ball stayed
i cant believe thats yellow magnet ball staying up there on silver stick
try the other one magnet ball buddy
isnt there another ball
maybe that one maroon magnet ball would work better
cant believe that ones yellow magnet ball staying up there
here you go
i know
these ones washers
then put the bar silver stick across like that
like on both of them silver men
make that purple star magnet stay up there on top of silver stick
stay up there top of construction
you can leave that referent unclear like that chi
what thing
it magnet ball maybe rolled down here bottom of black base
its referent unclear right where you put it
here comes the door
watch out for her stuff
what are you doing
wheres your cat
you have to do this like the year rafeala and petra useta come over remember
look at that chis construction
in between those ones silver men
there you go
you know you gotta return them magnets maybe
oh im sorry buddy
its going
all set
and -um
lets see
that is all the questions i have for you chi and i was gonna a have talk with your mom a bit
so w what could happen is you could take that stuff with you
here are some objects that we asked you to play with four years ago
so do i play too
i dont know
you can take everything out of there
youre so much different
dump it
oh cool
i dont remember these
this is neat stuff
look at these little guys
hang on
lets get everything off this
oh another one
this black base must be a magnet too
i like these little guys referent unclear
theres a bunch of little magnets
these referent unclear are magnets too i think
hes plastic turtle not magnetized
but this horseshoe magnet is a
think this red magnet ball is a magnet too
yeah it magnet ball is
this red magnet ball is a magnet too
this referent unclear will not work
bet this blue arrow magnet is one too
what is that silver stick
i like the paper clips too
do you know why that silver man will not stand up
because theres so much more metal here flat surface of man to be attracted to the magnet
that it black base magnet pulls it silver man over
neat huh
those silver men are cool
they coins dont work
i know
oh yeah
i like this silver ball
this silver ball is cool
oh yeah
this magnets is neat
what else we got under here
these magnet balls are neat
theres on yellow wand a bunch of magnets
those plastic teddy and coins arent magnetized either
oh yeah
we can build something here black base
i dont think this silver circle is a magnet
didnt work
look at this silver man stuck to silver circle
did you see that
magnet did
they silver men look like little acrobats
oh yeah
did you see all the stuff i had that time
its really neat
you know what i like watching
that that magician show
that science guy
hes cool
he does stuff like this
hm cool
oh look
i got two of them silver men
looks like theyre silver men dancing
that silver men on silver circle is so neat
those balls definitely have their own agenda here
oh cool
thats yellow wand construction neat
get back in there
he silver man is
oh neat
you do
these silver men are neat
they remind me of those
that bad boy
you know what im talking about
the t-shirts and bumper stickers
this horseshoe magnet is like a really weak magnet
atlas holding up the world
thats chis construction cool
thats chis construction really cool
thats ten minutes
so what wed like you guys to do is just play with these magnets for a bit
we got these magnets
i sent away for quite a few of them magnets
oh you did
should try to build something
whats that referent unclear
whats this yellow wand one here
this here yellow wand looks like one of those
is this yellow wand a magnet too
a magnets inside of the yellow wand
see if we can get something going
oh it referent unclear fell out
lets see if we can get him silver man hanging upside down
wait a minute
hey thats not right
get him silver man back up
thats silver man dangling above table what i look like
thats besides the point
lets see if we can do this referent unclear
yeah well
see there it referent unclear goes
see if you we can do it that way
put them silver men up
put them silver men way up
like youre playing
whats that that game
the monkey one
thats whats the name of that one
i dont know what the name is
want me to do it placing another silver man on the tower that way with the silver man in an upside down position too
-uh oh
now hes silver man gonna fall
-uh oh
too bad those silver men in the tower didnt stick up
remember the one magnet set i wanna send away for
with the looks like a christmas tree one
come on lets do it this way stacking objects on black base
stack it referent unclear
stack these nuts
put these nuts up on it chis tower
there you go
let me let me do my own building
look look chi
feel this magnetic force
wait a minute
just stick the whole thing silver stick like this and feel the pressure
can you feel it force
yeah you can
hold it silver stick with your hands
hold it like this and you can
this one mots washer here isnt repelled
but that one silver stick does
try to put it silver stick down onto the black base
can you feel it repulsion between black base and silver stick
can you feel it silver stick moving being repelled by the base
penny will not stick
here chi
its orange mans too heavy
look at this one here purple star magnet chi
this one here purple star magnet with a silver man on top of it will not
theres another one nut
see if you can stand these washers up like that on its side on top of your tower
like the bigger nuts and bolts
put them like this one
see if you can do that make a tower of washers
you like magnets
that tower of nuts was your best one
yeah look at that tower of nuts
thats tower of nuts amazing
put them washers up on top of the nut tower
lets see
put them washers way up
oh be careful
its towers moving
its tower moving
lets try it this way
will not do it hang from the other washer
we can make it hanging washer move
oh neat
wheres my muscles
mother dear aint got no muscles
about right now chi would be taking a tantrum and throwing them
lets put it washer down on this one unfinished side of the cube here
this one unfinished side of the cube
im gonna put another one
well put him silver man there on the unfinished side of the cube
will not work
poke my eyes
oh lets make a bridge
let us take this tower of nuts one down
dont take it objects on black base all down
and you know what well do
well put one of these silver stick through it hole in nut
like this
like this here
and so this nut
put this nut one here on black base
and this nut one over here on black base next to the first nut
and put one nut in the middle in between the other two nuts so
see that one nut which was on the silver stick
heres another one nut
and another one nut
lets put this there
what are you gonna do
its nuts which chi is stacking on black base all gonna going to go downhill down here
itll chis structure go down
think you got it got the washer to stick to the nuts
can you do it get the washer to stick to nuts
i thought it bridge was gonna go down
let me see if i can
maybe that one
maybe those bolts nuts are too heavy
why dont you try these washers
or try this silver stick across the top of the bridge
try that one silver stick
see how it nut went right down
put him silver man up on the top of the tower
like king of the hill
these here thin refrigerator-type magnet stick
these here thin refrigerator-type magnets stick too
but these thin refrigerator magnets aint got no
heres next to and under the silver bowl more of these washers
okay watch
you got a whole bunch of these red orange and yellow balls
put what
its black bases moving on you
oh my god
the magic wand
can you do it put the wand on the black base
oh its wand and the base are pushing
slipped it wand on there base
feeling huh
im gonna move it black base on you
that side of the base dont work
oh look at that
here you go
because once it object hits the magnet it object becomes magnetic
didnt you know that that objects become magnetic when they touch magnets
try that red ball
probably will not do it pick up a washer with two silver sticks at the bottom of the chain instead of just one
thats green triangle too heavy i think
hes chis into magnets
he chi wants magnets
know that referent unclear
will not that thin refrigerator magnet pick up
thats referent unclear a copper penny
copper pennies should never pick up
did you see it silver stick at the bottom of the chain bend
oh yeah
build the men silver men up
how do you wanna build them silver men
what about trying to do one like
you can
yeah maybe see if you can put a ball in there under the turtles shell and then we can move him turtle around the table
think so
get a big
try this one yellow wand
try this one yellow wand
put him turtle down
see if you can make him turtle move around
he has already got a ball inside him turtle
what are you trying
think so
its already dark outside
no that one silver bowl
i didnt do it
no more
put this silver man on here on top of the silver men
and move him silver man
you touched my piece men silver man
he he silver man mot is tapping will not do it rock back and forth without falling over
try it making mots silver man rock back and forth without falling down
try it
how come he mots silver man dont do it rock back and forth
how come he mots silver man dont
it will not do it chi
how come mine my silver man dont do that rock back and forth
its not funny
how come mine silver man dont
mine silver man dont
how come it silver man will not do it rock back and forth
how come he silver man dont do that rock back and forth chi
try it making mots silver man rock
lets try one of these another silver man which was lying on the table
he mots second silver man will not do it rock back and forth
how come yours silver men will do it rock and mine silver men dont
its no fair
its what allows the silver men to rock right over here in that space specific area in center of base
the dancing partners
no dancing without a partner huh
try it putting a third silver man between the two silver men
then theyll three silver men probably be all sticked together
yeah look at those three silver men
well see you are a professional magnet here
he likes magnets
weve always
ive got magnets all over the place
theres gotta be a whole bunch of them magnets upstairs in his room
now the last thing we have for you to do together remember these things which we brought when you had your i dont know it was like our third visit to your house
-um so i brought them again for you to play with
and we would like the two of you to -um play with them and feel free to discuss them as you play
-um you can take all this stuff out
and that is my favorite item
and if you dont mind were your hands
it penny doesnt
you can dump that stuff magnets in their box out
i mean you dont have to keep it in the little
if you want
makes it easier to grab
easy way to clean everything up
dont you wish you had one of those yellow wand to clean your room
thats yellow wand just a wand i think
it yellow wand picks up the magnets
the star
what doesnt
yeah these metal balls look like gum balls dont they
careful bro
can you scoot back
thanks bro
now try it
can make him silver man dance
the amazing flying object
youre using it referent unclear
what are you trying to do
and now we have another task for you to do which might seem a little familiar
to play with
now i know what it
these things to do
so you can
just kind of
different things
and you know well just give you a little bit of time like ten minutes or so
it referent unclear dont look good
ah i tell you
this the purple star is magnetic too
only on that side the black side
looks like a dog or a ram or something
let me let me see
shes very attra
homemade too
not bad
remember the different sides of a magnet chi
thats why its the washer doing that not staying on the yellow ball
oh cool
and shes chi a scientist too
you building now
its the silver man holding the square magnet pretty cool
way to go
do any more
how do you think he the top silver man got up there onto the top of the pyramid
miniature trampoline
look at this
lets make sure we get
you have to leave
will it stand up
whats that
are you gonna take them all off
haley has bad things
and she has all the magnets
okay alright
what are you gonna do
are you gonna pick them objects all up with that
wheres the little people
i wanna see the little people
can i see these silver men
look chi
they silver men will not stand up
look chi
these are the olympics
jump over the pole
look chi
hes silver man gonna go bowling
did you see it silver man and ball
hes silver man gonna go bowling
it silver man fell
how did i get it silver ball on there silver man before
i had it silver ball on his silver man hand
try the other side
there it is
i thought he silver man was gonna stand up
hes silver man in the circus
chi i cant make nothing anything stand up
look at that horseshoe magnet
this horseshoe magnet has north and south
do you remember which ones
i think if you put north on north
then it will not stick
you know how when you have two magnets and you put them together
and they push away from each other
and then if it
yeah but like the little tiny magnets
if we put them together sometimes
and the other one will flip around before itll stick
all magnets have a north and a south side
thats why
see the north
thats why it has this unclear referent on there
he burnt the magnet
this blue and white checkered magnet is the kind that sticks on our refrigerator
its horseshoe magnet not strong enough
oh look
hes silver man standing
i made him silver man stand
lets put the other one silver man up
wheres the other one silver man
find the other man
oh you have him silver man
yeah get him silver man
and theres no
we can do walk like an egyptian
theyre silver men playing soccer
be careful
this one silver man with stick in hand has a stick
this one silver man has a ball on his head
gotta give something to all of them silver men
well the cent will not hold
look at him silver man
hes silver man gonna throw it paper clip
this plastic teddy bear doesnt have a
this plastic teddy bear isnt a magnet
theres a ball in the middle
hes silver man in the olympics
its called the teddy bear throw
they are
in the olympics
who told you that
how come these plastic magnet balls will not stay on his silver man head
and the little ones silver magnet balls will
can you figure that one out
look at that chis construction
well watch this
it aint gonna work
go ahead
its your turn
i think youre not gonna win
and this guyll silver man stand on his feet
why did you take out your hearing aid
it might be easier now to put the other guy on
right there
will not fall
we did it
try it like this
put pull that head top silver man off
pull it silver man off
yeah right mom
yeah right chi
go away
you have to go away
okay chi
i can play with them when you guys are all done
lets try to make it in a circle
lets see
theyll silver men be holding hands
well what about
theres one guy right there side of black base
wonder if these washers can go
wheres the other ball
oh you know what this silver stick could be
wait a minute
maybe it silver stick cant be
you know them barbells
and weights
put one on this end
who is it
what does that turtle do
i dont know
this silver man can be the spotter over here edge of black base
these silver men are wrestling guys
this one yellow wand almost can pick this one black base up huh
wait something under it
theres a ball underneath
turn it black base over
yeah because thats silver circle what
stand up
they silver men will not without that silver circle
i dont think
this silver circle is the ring fighting ring

see if hes third object magnetic like that
just wondering
he referent unclear doesnt stick that way
you just show me
look at that
hes referent unclear not magnetic like that
his negatives and his positives arent right
only only because of this the black base
you metal pieces have to do that be connected to the magnetism of the black base
its metal pieces charged to the metal
go ahead
he silver man still isnt gonna
no it silver man sticks
not between his silver man legs
did it
thats what i was wondering
ill take it off
im gonna try it right now
thats because this base is probably real strong making all the magnets strong
which one
which one cant work chi
this guy

huh thats like a circus act
stand on the star
i dont know
i the schedule memorized
oh wow
lets hope its a soft landing

because if she brings them to somebody elses house theyll be infected
with the chicken pox
so heres all the stuff that you guys can play with
and im gonna
the one thing we do
i could do it too
you both get to do it okay
so you know just like fool around with them
oh listen to her sis
you know what these are chi
chi do you know what this is
its a magnet
can you pull it the washer off of the black base
i this the yellow wand is
feel it
go in the other room please
excuse me
thats okay
thats moving the balls on the base by waving the wand over them pretty good
it a silver man sticks to it the wand too
whats in there wand
put the dime up there on the yellow wand
does the dime stick
well it dime just doesnt stick does it dime
for some reason
because we just dumped a bunch of stuff together
some of it objects works and some of it objects doesnt
n now thats a silver stick like a magic wand
can you pull him referent unclear up
where did that one silver man maybe go
hey look chi
theres another man silver man
put him silver man in the middle
is he silver man sticking
oh too heavy
here wait a minute
give me this book so it doesnt get ruined
some of it -um that sticks and some doesnt
pretty good
get them silver men to stay up
put him a silver man on top
on top of this one silver man
you having troubles
see how far up you can get them silver men
pretty neat
am i in your way
no its fine
anything small like that is good for her fingers
oh yeah
for the coordination
you know what you can do sis i mean chi
-um while i -um talk with your mom you can take that -um all those stuff with you into the other room if you wanna keep working on it
howd that be
wanna dump it in the bag
let me give you this easy thing to carry it with you
i am going to tape you
thats it
this yellow wand is neat
oh these magnet balls are magnets chi
lets build something chi
i dont think thatll silver stick stand up
if you go maybe like that it might
this person silver man
stand him silver man up
i bet i can get him silver man to stand on his head
have him silver man stand on his head
hey have these things silver man stand on top of this one silver man already on base
oh yeah
oh look here chi
this dime doesnt stick
this dime doesnt stick
none of the money sticks
oh i know
is that silver circle a magnet
i thought
yeah it is
now thats face construction a good idea
how about if we do it mouth with clips
make the smily face with paper clips
for the lips
do they paper clips stick
doesnt wanna stay up there
try it like this
now i cant get the smile fa done
what else are you gonna put on there
what are you gonna do hair with
these things silver men could be hair kind of huh
now lift it yellow wand up
see if it will stay in place
show the camera
oh well
i got a picture of it
what are you gonna build
i think it magnet ball went on the rug
there you go
almost lost it that time
that yellow checked triangle doesnt stick though
see if you can put another one silver man on top of that one silver man chi
oh you wanted it construction of silver men like that
i thought you wanted it like that chi
wonder if you could fit that big screw -um bolt nut on top of that one silver man
pretty neat chi
pretty good
do you think you can fit him fifth silver man on top
looks like a -um
that show on where they do
where they stand on each others shoulders
can i do something
i was gonna go like that but it will not stay
i better not
very good
doesnt wanna stay there on top
what if you put another one washer on top of
what if you put a big screw down there under the ball
i mean bolt
or if you put two of these washers on top of each other
put two of those little things washers on top of each other
and then put the red thing magnet ball in
i dont know
doesnt wanna stay
oh good
let me get a close up of that chis construction
thats great
ill ill just watch out
because those things are magnetized
and they demagnetize tapes
i see
that stuff clanking in here
its a new toy
what about some of these things objects on black base are on the side
well how about you take them objects off
and then we get to see what we have to play with here
thats black base really strong huh
i found another fellow
so is this round thing silver circle like the stage
i see
want with those things
so are these silver men like the flying walendas or something
remember them
we could do
we could do this washer one like a little -um
but they washer dont stand up though
cant the flying walendas be the -um
kind of juggling
thats silver stick on black base interesting
look at this
hi there
thats chis construction very interesting
what about a walenda silver man up there
lets try one indirectly
youre youre awfully grabby
have you noticed that
id still like to try a walenda
it will not do that huh
the falling walenda
my walendas are juggling
i dont like that referent unclear
yes please
it yellow wand just picked up a lot of things here on black base
get your hands off my walendas
wait a second
what else do we have here on black base
lying down
what else do you have on here
oh yeah
would their feet silver men go in here washer
this is interesting silver man standing on a nut
think thats nut a foundation
keep them silver men from falling
what about this referent unclear
look at
you think this nut maybe will keep them straight up in
chi look
soccer walenda
hes playing something
look at
maybe he silver man can kick it silver ball through the goal horseshoe magnet
look at
do we have anymore
look at this
nothing can tip this guy silver man over
is this yellow and white checked triangle a magnet
some things just
i dont
these magnets are tricky
because this blue and white checked square magnet looks like a magnet huh
but its blue and white square not
does that one yellow and white triangle magnet really stick
or do you have it yellow and white checked triangle magnet sort of wedged under there
let me see
well you got a lot
but now so what
it wasnt very constructive
what you just did
you forgot a walenda
let me see you make something
instead of just wrecking it though
oh i thought you were gonna try to put it referent unclear on his silver man shoulders
what would happen if you do it the other way
on his silver man shoulders
and go like that puts silver stick on shoulders of men
what if you crisscrossed one of those bars silver sticks
maybe you could build from there
see how far you can stack it construction
and do it nicely
s slow down
doing junk
and were sposta do it together
and i dont like the way youre doing it
its a mess
quit it a minute
stop it
i want you to listen
excuse me
you had a good concept going here with these guys standing up
i liked this silver men on base
right place
about another minute
its not a test
you can play with them afterwards
oh thats chis construction interesting
oh they silver men walk on that silver stick
yeah but you could probably
that would be a good way to stack them too
hes silver man a little
what if you put one of these bars silver stick shoulders
and then you can do a straight line
get it
stand two silver men up
you missing a bar
theres still one bar left right
put him silver man on the top
then give him the bar
here it silver stick is
its silver stick down here on table
oh i like it construction
very nice
nice way to end
i like it construction
good job
thats interesting to look at
i like it like that
that guy can stand on his head
we have all these goodies that we brought at a previous visit -um for you with
and wed like you guys to play with them again for awhile
you can open them up and use as much as you want but its been a little cold so
well put them back in there
chi look at this one red ball on flat silver circle
the -um wrenches
see if it would pull
oh my god
on the floor
he referent unclear was slinking along to see if he referent unclear would drag on this maybe black base
the people silver men
put the people silver men
i like these little guys silver men all stuck together
what do you mean
this penny
that penny isnt
its penny a coin
on the lines
do it lift objects here
the feet of the silver man
these objects are too heavy
now this flat silver circle isnt a magnet
the a magnet
thats what it is
now do this
see if it yellow wand will stick on to here nut placed on silver circle
i like that magnet
what happened to them referent unclear presumably the silver men or the magnetic objects in general
did you see that referent unclear
chi look at this
i think hes turtle watching
too heavy
getting too heavy
thats ringing phone alright
thats the answering machine
no too heavy
try this a flat black round piece
now wheres this red ball
no that red ball doesnt magnetize onto that round flat black piece
this one referent unclear
this triangle is too heavy
try this washer
try to get another circle washer
not enough magnetic force left in it chain
try this triangle now
it round flat piece went up my sleeve
know what they use that yellow wand for
excuse me
you got a bunch of these orange man
try another one a washer
know what
try this referent unclear
see if this referent unclear is lighter
or strong enough
inside it referent unclear is
i put it all in the circle flat silver circle
did you see that
chi watch
look over here by paper clip and black base and watch
just lay it black base down on top of pile of objects and see if it black base lifts the whole thing pile of objects up
oh spa
way to go chi
what a grand finale there
so what we have here
-um are all these
-uh toys
wed like you to sorta sort of play with them for a couple minutes or so
and just kinda kind of talk and play and

see if you can pull that blue magnet arrow
i think this black base is too heavy for it
try this one blue magnet arrow
this will blue arrow stick to it black base
but this blue arrow is just too heavy a piece
kinda kind of like a refrigerator magnet
just too heavy
looks like you only can do one at a time
whats that

and thats nut heavier than that washer from which nut is hanging
now see if you can get this paper clip on that silver man
shes tape recording it
she has got it
get it back up there again
now your getting me all into this
yes he did

what are you doing
you know what
thats great
that has been a over ten minutes
thats excellent
thank you

i love that
on that note i think we can end
now the money in there is on purpose
you cant keep the money
oh wow
thats black base a strong magnet
dont hurt yourself
does that plastic turtle open
the magnets inside here black base
do you think
is the magnet inserted in here black base
how can they tell if its black base -um
see how it nickel moves around
how can you test it magnet in black base
like maybe put it nickel here
versus over here because
we just put the magnet on this side
to see if theres a difference
does the coin
the coins not staying with it
try that on the other side of the coin
try this one
will the coin stay
lets try one that we know works
why dont you make one of your creations
heres a stick
look at that yellow wand over the base
oh chi
feel that
whats happening there
what do you what do you think is going on
why did it do that
well the magnets on both sides
but what you s
remember what you learned about -um
what was it in that that the book we read about magnets and electromagnetic energy
do you you remember what it said about -um positive and negative connections
do you remember what that said
do you remember what that said
what did it say
remember what we read
i didnt think you were -um on
-um remember what we read in your book for -um the electromagnetic energy
the light and electricity and stuff
about the positive and negative whatever waves
how it caused
you know
some attract and some repel
do you remember that
positive and negative energy
so what do you think is going on here
because these are magnets just like what we read about
do you remember what it said about positives and negatives
what did it say
because thatll help explain why this on this side what is it doing
compared to this side
wait a minute
you know what
i asked you to make one of these neat figures
i really want you to
but i just want you to figure this out for a minute first
can you do that
just for a minute
and then you can do that
just i just want you to answer me this
because thatll help you figure a lot
why is it that this one pushes away from here the top of the black base and that its the yellow wand attracting there side of the black base
whats this called when they push away
or or repeling
what does that mean
it bounces off right
so what happens when youre going like that
whats that connection
when theres this
thats when they attract right
and i forget
was it negatives
of them attract
and one combination of them repel right
you can actually
do you think you could move like move a car that way
if you put that yellow wand in the engine
and you put it on wheels
and made it move
you think you could though
with that kind of energy
see how see how you make it move
without even touching it
wouldnt that be neat if you could like power a car that way
and you wouldnt need any gas
chi imagine that you had the wheels right
put the wheels on the side
imagine you could glue them on and they would turn
do you think you could make it black base roll
with this yellow wand just this electric magnetic energy
do you think
i think thats kinda kind of neat
well i forget what combinations of positive and negatives it is but we could look that up
why dont you make a platform for your -uh stage
now do this
because you make these awesome really awesome designs
oh i know
im just
you have these magnet balls at home right
these things magnet balls
well actually
you think you could -um
you could make it a wheel with it
is that chis construction repeling
i think that we needta get some more make them
these guys silver men
you know how like the thing yellow wand was pushing like that
if you can make one of the guys kinda kind of standing up somehow
like yeah
like you know like with the that repeling
if you could keep keep it silver man suspended
above something
like being pulled with the magnetic energy this way
but to have that
to have that yank
that that you know that pull
see that pull
but not have it yellow wand actually touch
see that
how its not touching but if you can feel the pull down
whats the difference in this yellow wand
does that other side of wand do the same thing
now try try the -uh difference on on here
see both sides
if its yellow wand the same on both sides
its not
is one repeling and one attracting
what about the sides
theyre different too
try and make make one of your figures
you know
some awesome things
i keep interrupting you
have it
hes smart
okay make something neat
i know you did
make one of your little things
one of your shapes
none of the coins are magnetic
how do you know
you know theyre made out of different metals
dont you
none of them will
whats a penny made out of
what about if you turn these coins over
do you think it makes a difference
how about on the back side of the magnet
well stop
you can make your design now
imagine how tall you can -um make it
there you go
ill give you the pieces and you can do it okay
now imagine if they silver men werent magnetic
they silver men wouldnt stay up too well would they
what are you looking for
another person
thats great
well you know what

too bad we didnt have a sign turtle crossing
oh yeah

make it plastic magnet ball go the other way
turn the stick around
you get one stick
doesnt magnet ball wanna go over there
the other way
but it magnet ball doesnt wanna move over the side
but these guys other magnet balls on table down here do
what about this one silver magnet ball
