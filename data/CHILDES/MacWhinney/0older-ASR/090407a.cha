*PAR3:	your corn . 158285_159455
*PAR2:	is six sixteen grams . 159455_162095
*PAR1:	one grams . 164635_165255
*PAR1:	let's see . 165255_165535
*PAR1:	that'd be a hundred grams that would be about . 165535_166855
*PAR1:	that's how much sugar they have . 166855_167935
*PAR1:	now that's in how much that'd be about right . 167935_171655
*PAR1:	that's [/] that's the worst in how much . 171655_173495
*PAR3:	in . 174975_175195
*PAR1:	a bowl serving per serving it would have that much . 175195_177515
*PAR3:	lemme see . 177765_178355
*PAR2:	what a serving me . 182135_183305
*PAR0:	a bowl about sixteen grams . 183865_185585
*PAR0:	so it's like a bowl of . 185585_186625
*PAR1:	cereal . 186625_186825
*PAR1:	I would say that Marky puts that much in his cheerios . 187145_190185
*PAR1:	mhm . 190185_190465
*PAR0:	okay . 190895_191185
*PAR1:	you know that Mark mhm . 192725_194185
*PAR1:	so he's like you lose the advantage of cheers . 194185_197425
*PAR1:	the not sweet but by all the junky sugar you put in it . 197565_200945
*PAR1:	mhm . 200945_201305
*PAR1:	you turn it into a sweet pond . 202325_204025
*PAR2:	can you do something to make the drink more . 206565_208505
*PAR0:	yeah . 209735_210025
*PAR1:	what . 210025_210305
*PAR1:	so the [/] the answer is that if you want to eat cinnamon toast as long as you don't put sugar in it it's actually not as bad as what you do to Cheerios . 210645_219025
*PAR0:	it . 219845_220065
*PAR1:	isn't no . 220075_220945
*PAR1:	what you do to cheerios . 220945_221945
*PAR1:	is worse than cinnamon than [/] than this junky cereal . 221945_224985
*PAR1:	move . 225135_225425
*PAR1:	Mark . 225425_225665
*PAR0:	because . 226215_226705
*PAR1:	you put too much . 226705_227185
*PAR1:	I thought it was less . 227305_227825
*PAR1:	you put too much . 227925_228625
*PAR1:	no . 228645_228865
*PAR1:	you put too much sugar . 228885_229825
*PAR0:	in . 229825_229985
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 229985_230225
*PAR1:	if you would just put one spoon of sugarin cheerios . 230885_233265
*PAR1:	it would be okay . 233265_233865
*PAR1:	but you put too much . 233925_234665
*PAR2:	how much is one . 234765_235585
*PAR1:	one spoon . 235965_236505
*PAR0:	yeah . 236855_237145
*PAR1:	maybe eight grams . 237515_238545
*PAR2:	died not . 241425_242035
*PAR1:	but you keep on pouring the sugar in . 242295_244155
*PAR1:	that's why it gets so bad . 246175_247355
*PAR1:	Rox the idea . 247575_248955
*PAR2:	me and thing get cool . 253355_255335
*PAR1:	a little bit . 258215_258535

*PAR0:	yeah . 296155_296445
*PAR1:	but if you run away <it might> [/] it might get eaten up by somebody else . 297345_300765
*PAR1:	I'm serious . 302585_302925

*PAR4:	and Marky said . 316145_318205
*PAR4:	dad's just like me in hearing when I &-uh say when I say . 318295_326365
*PAR4:	what [/] what [/] what to my friends . 326435_328805
*PAR4:	and finally they say . 329025_330165
*PAR4:	oh Nevermind is that right . 330585_335915
*PAR4:	Mark . 335915_336155
*PAR0:	yeah . 337225_337515
*PAR2:	but when they [/] they tell me it first then I say . 338895_345995
*PAR2:	what . 346025_346315
*PAR2:	what . 346385_346675
*PAR2:	and [/] and keep on saying . 347295_348715
*PAR2:	what [/] what [/] what [/] what [/] what [/] what [/] what [/] what . 348785_351515
*PAR2:	what . 351585_351875
*PAR2:	so a couple times . 352695_353635
*PAR2:	and then they finally say . 354415_355875
*PAR2:	no . 356295_356515
*PAR0:	never . 357175_357525

*PAR0:	I did . 367345_367665
*PAR0:	yeah . 367775_368065
*PAR0:	I'll tell you what . 369935_370505
*PAR1:	maybe you're just like that or you just can't [/] can't make sense out of what those kids are saying . 370555_374465
*PAR0:	you could pretend . 377845_378585
*PAR1:	you could pretend you're understanding even though you don't understand . 378965_381785
*PAR1:	just wait . 381815_382345
*PAR1:	just don't say what . 383615_384505
*PAR1:	just wait and see if it matters . 384505_385705
*PAR0:	right . 386315_386665
*PAR1:	often it doesn't matter . 386915_387945
*PAR0:	I know . 388545_388945
*PAR1:	and you could pretend you understood them even if it didn't . 389965_392385
*PAR0:	that's what I do sometimes . 394245_395785
*PAR1:	I know . 396345_396625
*PAR1:	and then sometimes if you do that you'll get really tripped . 396885_399385
*PAR1:	because then it'll turn out you really needed to understand that . 399785_402945

*PAR1:	were you listening . 404065_404745
*PAR1:	were you listening to me . 405615_406665
