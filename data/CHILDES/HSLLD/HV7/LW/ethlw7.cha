@Comment:	Time is 6:16. MOT is talking quietly , and it seems like the tape recorder is very far away from her
@Comment:	This session was recorded from the time 3:58 , but there was silence until 6:16 , when Mot and Chi talked to each other a little. They did not say anything of consequence , just mumbled a bit and Mot suggested to Chi that she sign the letter first , and Chi after that. After a little more mumbling (which was hard to hear because it seemed they were far away from the tape recorder) , INV asked Chi to read the letter outloud , which he did. Therefore , it seems Chi and Mot , who wrote two sentences at the end of the letter , possibly wrote the letter without talking at all. Other possible explanations are that their conversations were not picked up by the tape recorder , or that the taping started after they discussed most aspects of the letter. There was also much discussion between Mot and EXP at the beginning of the tape , at which time Chi may have been working on the letter.
