*PAR0:	yeah . 405500_409240
*PAR0:	but we don't have like a bottle or anything with it . 409240_413080
*PAR0:	it's just like a doll . 413080_414420
*PAR0:	yeah I think I've seen him at daycare feed . 414420_419180
*PAR0:	yeah I think they do have a baby with like a little bottle . 419180_421280
*PAR0:	think I've seen him feed her the bottle . 421900_425800
*PAR0:	and there are babies at daycare too . 425920_427580
*PAR0:	so he sees like an actual baby get fed . 427700_430260
*PAR0:	so . 430540_431420
*PAR0:	oh that's cool . 433100_433780
*PAR0:	he didn't seem to be too into the book . 434660_437460
*PAR0:	does he like to read at home . 437520_438740
*PAR0:	yeah he does he'll often like bring us a book or like bring us books over and over . 439360_444360
*PAR0:	sometimes he'll just like be bringing us stuff . 444360_446380
*PAR0:	and like we'll start to read . 446380_447340
*PAR0:	and he'll go get another one . 447340_448220
*PAR0:	he doesn't really wanna read it . 448320_449240
*PAR0:	he just wants to bring us stuff . 449320_450780
*PAR0:	&-um but we read like everyday like in the afternoon . 451400_454320
*PAR0:	and definitely before bed we always read before bed . 454320_456480
*PAR0:	so was [/] was he into this &-um the books at the last session or I thought I think there's a . 456500_462040
*PAR0:	couple other different ones like this one . 462040_463720
*PAR0:	yeah there's just this one I think here . 463720_465580
*PAR0:	but I know the other one had a couple books . 465580_467880
*PAR0:	yeah I think he was more into them last time . 467880_470240
*PAR0:	but I think maybe he sees them more of like a quiet activity at home . 470240_473740
*PAR0:	and this is more like active when he can have other stuff . 473740_477100
*PAR0:	so yeah like fun time . 477100_478320
*PAR0:	yeah . 478320_478560
*PAR0:	did &-um did he was he into the baby at the last session or the animals at the last sessions . 478860_484560
*PAR0:	is everything a little different for I think so . 485240_486860
*PAR0:	yeah it's a little different . 486860_487820
*PAR0:	alright . 488160_488460
*PAR0:	good job . 488460_489480
*PAR0:	I think he was more into like the stuffed animals . 490400_493520
*PAR0:	I think last time he had stuffed animals instead of these animals . 493520_497460
*PAR0:	yeah . 497460_498140
*PAR0:	and so I don't know although I would think he'd be into these because they're kind of like cool little figurines I know they are fun . 498140_504920
*PAR0:	I don't know . 504920_506460
*PAR0:	so overall the way he played was pretty similar to before like you know with food . 506460_511080
*PAR0:	yeah . 511080_511600
*PAR0:	he just kind of like focuses in on one thing . 511600_514000
*PAR0:	and I don't know part of Ittoo is there's just like a lot here . 514000_516860
*PAR0:	so like at home we're I mean I don't make him like put one thing away before he gets another thing out . 516860_522680
*PAR0:	like he will take out a lot of things but usually not like this much at once . 522680_527500
*PAR0:	yeah it's probably like a lot of stuff going on . 528240_530280
*PAR0:	so yeah you'll have to see it though . 530280_533080
*PAR0:	&-um is there anything else you wanna tell me about &-um his play or what you did or &-um any questions . 533960_540200
*PAR0:	&-um I don't think I think he may have been a little tired because he . 540200_544200
*PAR0:	wasn't as like playful . 544200_545460
*PAR0:	I didn't think as like at home . 545460_547300
*PAR0:	but yeah we did a lot of his stuff . 547300_551160
*PAR0:	so but he did you know look around . 551160_553180
*PAR0:	and he loves zippers . 553180_554180
*PAR0:	so I didn't think he I was trying to get him to play with these . 554180_556480
*PAR0:	and then maybe like figure out which animals go where . 556480_558760
*PAR0:	but he just wanted to play with the zippers really . 558760_560660
*PAR0:	so yeah probably more into the bat than actually the scene . 560660_567120
*PAR0:	yeah . 567120_567680
*PAR0:	okay . 567680_570120
*PAR0:	well I guess that's all I have for you . 570120_572120
*PAR0:	I [/] I just have one last consent form . 572120_574560
*PAR0:	okay . 574560_574920
*PAR0:	well two consents . 574920_576120
*PAR0:	&-um the basically the first one just let me . 576120_582360
*PAR0:	okay . 582360_582800
*PAR0:	first one is basically &-um we're trying to &-um collect like an online database of &-um transcripts of like child speech . 582800_590620
*PAR0:	and &-um it says it here . 590620_592420
*PAR0:	we pretty much now have like [/] like a database with transcripts . 592420_597060
*PAR0:	but they're sort of only as good as whoever did them . 597060_599860
*PAR0:	because if they only you know because of certain aspects that's all that they wrote down . 599860_604360
*PAR0:	and so like we're trying to get an audio one so that way we can listen . 604360_607340
*PAR0:	so if like other researchers want to listen to other aspects of it they can [/] can kind of pick what they want . 607340_612560
*PAR0:	and so it would be completely anonymous . 612560_614600
*PAR0:	we would de-identify everything . 614600_615660
*PAR0:	and it goes in without any demographic information . 615660_619460
*PAR0:	but that's just if you would like [/] like right now everything we have we just use for our study . 619460_622840
*PAR0:	but this is if you would also have us allow us to put it on the like international database they're trying to have . 622840_628820
*PAR0:	so there's I think on the other side there's three options like if you I think first is if you don't want to do it . 628820_636760
*PAR0:	if you would like just a transcript with no audio . 636760_639080
*PAR0:	okay . 639080_639720
*PAR0:	and then if you would like to &-um put the actual audio . 639720_642260
*PAR0:	okay . 642260_642920
*PAR0:	and so yeah whatever you'd like . 642920_644400
*PAR0:	and then the last &-um consent after that . 644400_647920
*PAR0:	sorry so many papers today . 647920_650040
*PAR0:	this one is &-um so basically we've been looking at his speech this whole time . 650700_655920
*PAR0:	but we also are interested in looking at your speech as well . 655960_658020
*PAR0:	we're interested in looking at things like your speaking rate . 658460_660960
*PAR0:	variety of words you use different things . 661200_662640
*PAR0:	like since we have everything recorded already we'd like to go back and maybe look at it and just kinda see sorta like how &-um the way you speak to him changes sort of as he develops and just looking at different aspects of that . 662720_673460
*PAR0:	so if you would like to allow us to do that as well . 673760_675600
*PAR0:	that's the last consent . 675940_676820
*PAR0:	okay . 677020_677280
*PAR0:	sorry . 677500_677720
*PAR0:	we have so many . 677720_678300
*PAR0:	no it's fine . 678460_679200
*PAR0:	we make you do so many things . 679240_680220
