*PAR0:	okay . 12340_12380
*PAR0:	that's good . 12420_12780
*PAR0:	&-um so what was she doing with the food . 13000_15280
*PAR0:	&-um she was examining it at first to see &-uh figure out what everything was . 15320_20780
*PAR0:	she usually does that too . 20900_22300
*PAR0:	&-um at home we have the same food . 22820_24380
*PAR0:	she usually knows what it is . 24480_25200
*PAR0:	but with new food sometimes she just tries to figure out what it is . 25240_28260
*PAR0:	I think she was really interested in like the &-uh rubbery &-uh fake food that feels kinda real . 28500_33680
*PAR0:	and then she was interested in &-uh cupcakes too . 33920_38080
*PAR0:	but because she likes cupcakes [/] cupcakes she likes muffins actually it's a baby . 39020_44720
*PAR0:	but &-um yeah she usually that's what she usually does is try to figure out what everything is . 45520_50460
*PAR0:	pretends to eat it or drink it and usually cook stuff too . 50460_57000
*PAR0:	unlike the stove the big stove . 57000_59080

*PAR0:	&-um so this was a cake too because of the swirling . 65660_69520
*PAR0:	and I'm actually surprised she didn't pick up on the pizza . 69520_71960
*PAR0:	but she kept calling the cans of stuff . 71960_75220
*PAR0:	coffee . 75220_75800

*PAR0:	so were there any foods she had never seen before . 83540_87660

*PAR0:	it's strawberry flavor juice . 116660_118440
*PAR0:	so I don't think she knows they don't really know orange juice that . 118460_121080
*PAR0:	well . 121080_121240
*PAR0:	yeah . 121500_121640

*PAR0:	that's about it . 125640_126660
*PAR0:	okay . 126800_127020
*PAR0:	so what else was she interested in &-um baby juice that &-uh it's not really a puzzle but the [/] the thing with the animals and the [/] the [/] the shoes with the dolls . 127320_137720
*PAR0:	she likes shoes . 137880_138560
*PAR0:	she likes taking her shoes off whenever she can . 138600_141140
*PAR0:	and putting other people's shoes on her feet . 141160_142940
*PAR0:	she'll do that at home . 143020_144720
*PAR0:	she'll just sit and put shoes on her feet . 144780_147200
*PAR0:	&-um she's and &-um she usually likes &-um dolls at home . 147200_152620
*PAR0:	she didn't seem to really care . 152920_154120
*PAR0:	she's was interested in the backpack more anything else . 154240_156800
*PAR0:	and she's kind of interested in animals too . 156800_160600
*PAR0:	mhm . 160980_161160
*PAR0:	so with &-uh I mean we call it a puzzle too . 162180_164740
*PAR0:	yeah it's you know &-um what was she kinda what was she doing with that . 164820_169080

*PAR0:	she likes to do that too . 171800_173000
*PAR0:	kinda just . 173260_173760
*PAR0:	puts stuff away . 173760_175420
*PAR0:	piles it up . 175420_176480
*PAR0:	she's good at that . 177040_178020
*PAR0:	were she looking at any of the different animals . 178040_181000
*PAR0:	anything . 181000_181380
*PAR0:	yeah . 181380_181600
*PAR0:	she was at the I think like <the ones that she> [/] the ones that she looked at more were the ones she didn't recognize more so than the ones she does were there any specific ones that she didn she maybe never seen before . 181600_193000
*PAR0:	&-um yeah &-um lobster . 193000_196260
*PAR0:	&-um oh you're stepping she doesn't really know dolphin . 196260_199640
*PAR0:	I know she's seen one before because my son's school mascot is a dolphin . 199640_205340
*PAR0:	but and like the whale . 205340_206840
*PAR0:	but I think most of them she's seen before . 206840_209860
*PAR0:	she's actually seen before at some point . 209860_212040
*PAR0:	okay . 212040_212460
*PAR0:	like she's gone to the zoo or something . 212460_214380
*PAR0:	yeah . 214380_214700
*PAR0:	yeah . 214700_215280
*PAR0:	does she have any favorite animals that she likes . 215280_217500
*PAR0:	&-um she likes cows a lot and cats but there are no cats there . 217500_221240
*PAR0:	she loves cows and cats . 221240_223160
*PAR0:	yeah . 223160_223960
*PAR0:	and so then with these animals <were there> [/] were there new animals there . 223960_229640
*PAR0:	yeah &-um octopus and &-um eagle and a lemur she thought was a cat . 229640_238480
*PAR0:	but that's fine . 238480_240280
*PAR0:	she doesn't really &-um know the otters though we have like otter stuff at home . 242120_248360
*PAR0:	&-um but I mean she kind of she just thinks swans and geese are ducks usually which is fine . 249720_255280
*PAR0:	it's understandable . 255380_256240
*PAR0:	yeah . 256780_257060
*PAR0:	but I think &-um some of the animals she knew I didn't get into all the animals that she didn't know &-um any other favorite animals that she saw or [/] or . 257640_269820
*PAR0:	no I don't think so she really liked that raccoon . 269820_273800
*PAR0:	but I think that's because she's trying to put it in her pocket . 273800_275980
*PAR0:	right . 275980_276340
*PAR0:	&-um was there anything else you played with today . 276940_281840
*PAR0:	I think we nope . 281840_282900
*PAR0:	I think we this thing . 282900_284640
*PAR0:	I think she just likes the &-um they just my kids like doing this . 284640_290080
*PAR0:	we have something like this at home . 290080_291640
*PAR0:	the &-um the screw nail thing . 291640_295000
*PAR0:	right . 295000_295600
*PAR0:	yeah I always see that . 295600_298080
*PAR0:	I feel like it's missing a piece or something . 298080_299700
*PAR0:	but there's another piece over there . 299700_301640
*PAR0:	but ours is actually like a [/] a tool bench that has it on top . 301640_306160
*PAR0:	and there's ones that you [/] you don't really hammer them . 306160_308100
*PAR0:	you just put in the their nails but you don't really can't hammer them in because they just slide right in . 308100_312780
*PAR0:	but [/] but the screw ones they actually can screw in and out . 312780_315760
*PAR0:	yeah but I'm so sad . 316420_318780
*PAR0:	okay . 318960_319720
*PAR0:	I'm surprised . 320400_320840
*PAR0:	she didn't do that earlier because she has a shopping cart at home . 320840_323680
*PAR0:	oh she does and put stuff in . 323780_324920

*PAR0:	&-uh here [/] here was there anything else that she usually plays with at home that we didn't have here &-um pocket [/] pocket &-um cars . 330700_340640
*PAR0:	but we have a lot of cars at home . 340960_343240
*PAR0:	&-um because you know she's got a brother so right with like seventy five eighty little &-uh hot wheel cars . 343780_349160
*PAR0:	yeah . 349380_349440
*PAR0:	so &-um yeah she loves the cars . 349920_351980
