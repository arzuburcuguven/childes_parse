@Comment:	Chi claims not to remember VHC so he reads it. Mot provides words when Chi gets stuck , and Fat provides encouragement and some words , though not the right ones. (Maybe he couldn't see the book.) Chi also substitutes words with similar first (and sometimes last) letters , and uses context to get read. Chi doesn't come up with ideas for the letter himself , but Mot and Fat don't have to dictate exactly what words to write. On the other hand , Chi turns to VHC to copy many of the words (including that ) for the letter.
