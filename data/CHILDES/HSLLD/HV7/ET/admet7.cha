@Comment:	video does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio.
@Comment:	MOT and Chi work together for the most part and the activities seem to be jointly directed. There is a fair amount of science talk; specifically about which objects stick (are magnetic) , magnetic force , and about north and south. Mot attempts to demonstrate magnetic force for Chi. Chi's younger Bro comes and goes during the activity and can be heard talking in the background to a friend during much of the activity. At the end Bro and his friend come and play with the magnets a little.
