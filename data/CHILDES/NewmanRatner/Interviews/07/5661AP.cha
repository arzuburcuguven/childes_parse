*PAR0:	okay . 83840_85460
*PAR0:	so what else do we have back here . 85460_87860
*PAR0:	so we said he liked the food the best . 87860_92360

*PAR0:	and he liked the ice cream cone . 93060_98060

*PAR0:	what else did he like the spoon . 98740_100580
*PAR0:	oh yes the spoon anything else and the pizza . 100580_104360
*PAR0:	he seemed to really like he &-um he seemed to like the books . 104360_110880
*PAR0:	but like he listened to the story and look at it every once in a while . 110880_113740
*PAR0:	but only if he had the other things to put in his mouth to entertain him . 113740_117100
*PAR0:	right I noticed . 117100_118340
*PAR0:	oh you are so funny . 118340_121660
*PAR0:	I am amazed that you sat for as long as you did . 121660_124340
*PAR0:	and now you notice everything . 124340_126660
*PAR0:	&-um and I guess he kinda he seemed more interested in the Pika baby book with the flaps that went up and down than he was interested in just the kind of story ones . 126660_138720
*PAR0:	&-um we don't have any . 138720_144660
*PAR0:	we have a lot of books at home . 144660_146000
*PAR0:	I don't think we have any . 146000_147020
*PAR0:	that have flaps in them right now . 147020_149660
*PAR0:	&-um we have like we good night moon have a bunch . 149660_156640
*PAR0:	we have like little color books and rhyming books . 156640_159060
*PAR0:	&-um and we have a touch and feel baby book . 159740_162740
*PAR0:	that's a very similar to this . 162740_164400
*PAR0:	what are you . 164460_164680
*PAR0:	oh . 164680_164880
*PAR0:	are you giving the baby some love . 164880_166660
*PAR0:	now he's interested in other things . 167440_171500
*PAR0:	&-um so you know a lot of the pictures in there were of animals . 172640_180940
*PAR0:	and you were saying their names . 180940_182260
*PAR0:	do you think you recognize any of them . 182260_184260
*PAR0:	I'm not sure that he does yet . 184260_186620
*PAR0:	it's kind of hard for me to tell . 186620_189880
*PAR0:	but oh yeah your persistence . 189880_199020
*PAR0:	that's what you are . 199020_200320
*PAR0:	I'm not I I'm not sure if he recognizes names yet or not . 200320_206060
*PAR0:	oh <do you> [/] do you . 206060_208480
*PAR0:	okay . 208480_209520
*PAR0:	there we go . 209520_210740
*PAR0:	what's here . 210740_212820
*PAR0:	look you want this pink ice cream cone . 212820_216740
*PAR0:	you can have it . 216740_222420
*PAR0:	so does he eat any of those same foods or do you just feed him at home or &-um we use a spoon that looks kind of like that to feed him . 222420_231800
*PAR0:	he does not get ice cream or pizza yet . 231800_234020
*PAR0:	but he does get &-um he does eat peas . 234020_237180
*PAR0:	and he doesn't really eat waffles or anything . 237180_241600
*PAR0:	he's playing with those too . 241600_243980
*PAR0:	most of his food is still pureed . 243980_247600
*PAR0:	so it all kind of looks the same . 247600_249360
*PAR0:	yeah . 250060_250100
*PAR0:	so do you think he likes some of the like . 251020_254180
*PAR0:	why do you think he likes certain foods out of like all of these . 254180_257620
*PAR0:	why do you think he likes a certain one . 257720_259120
*PAR0:	well the first thing he was drawn to was the ice cream cone . 259440_263200
*PAR0:	and honestly right now I think he's drawn to things that are a good fit in his . 263300_266860
*PAR0:	mouth . 266860_267140
*PAR0:	&-um like he the ice cream cone had kind of a pointy end . 267780_272860
*PAR0:	the spoon's a good shape for it . 272860_275020
*PAR0:	the pizza . 275020_276060
*PAR0:	once I showed him the pizza he realized it had a nice little corner . 276060_279140
*PAR0:	he could get in there . 279140_280880
*PAR0:	so and <the peas> [/] the peas might've beento them felt good on his little gums and his tongue . 280880_293740
*PAR0:	that's what I was thinking . 294600_295760
*PAR0:	maybe it was the texture . 295860_296900
*PAR0:	yeah . 297060_297360
*PAR0:	because we have a lot of kids like the peas just depending how they feel . 298740_302100
*PAR0:	yeah <the bumpy> [/] the bumpy . 302400_306660
*PAR0:	there we go . 306660_307880
*PAR0:	wow . 307880_309520
*PAR0:	okay . 309520_310000
*PAR0:	so did you say he uses utensils at home . 310000_314060
*PAR0:	no &-um no we [/] we feed him with a spoon . 314060_316980
*PAR0:	and very often we have to give him his own spoon so that we can feed him with another spoon . 316980_323100
*PAR0:	he likes to &-uh he doesn't really make an attempt to feed himself yet . 323100_328140
*PAR0:	but he is definitely interested in playing with his spoons . 328140_330600
*PAR0:	so I hope you better go get it . 330600_335020
*PAR0:	so which group of items do you think he liked the least &-um the stuffed animals . 337000_345880
*PAR0:	really . 345880_346260
*PAR0:	even when I showed him stuffed animals he didn't have that much interest in them . 346500_351560
*PAR0:	although I never did just take him over and show him the entire pile of them . 351560_359580
*PAR0:	&-um he wasn't really drawn them although he did kind of seem interested in this crazy hair on that thing . 359580_370220
*PAR0:	oh [/] oh &-um do you have any dolls at home . 370220_384660
*PAR0:	&-uh we do not have any dolls . 384800_386060
*PAR0:	we have some stuffed animals but no dolls . 386320_388340
*PAR0:	mhm . 388700_388900
*PAR0:	so do you think he'd ever see you . 389740_391880
*PAR0:	&-um like mimic you feeding someone or &-um I don't think at this point . 391880_400820
*PAR0:	that he you're a stinker . 400820_404520
*PAR0:	you're a stinker . 404520_407440
*PAR0:	yes you're strong and extremely mobile . 407440_411020
*PAR0:	yeah <I don't> [/] I don't think he's ever mimicked because I mean we have like little stuffed cats and some stuffed animals . 411020_420720
*PAR0:	and he's never tried to mimic it . 420720_426700
*PAR0:	does he like things that make sounds . 426700_429460
*PAR0:	yes . 429460_429880
*PAR0:	he does especially &-uh what is that . 429880_436980
*PAR0:	oh you come here . 436980_438120
*PAR0:	&-um we do some little music classes . 438120_443340
*PAR0:	and he likes shakers . 443340_444640
*PAR0:	and he likes bells . 444640_445820
*PAR0:	and he really likes anything plastic . 445820_449280
*PAR0:	he can get his hand on that makes a crinkly noise . 449280_451420
*PAR0:	&-um yeah he likes sounds . 452080_455600
*PAR0:	do you play any games with him like pancake or [/] or anything like that . 456360_460540
*PAR0:	&-um we do a lot of Peekaboo and we do some not exactly patty cake . 460540_468320
*PAR0:	although we do have patty cake in the book . 468320_469980
*PAR0:	&-um he doesn't really he gets very excited about Peekaboo but when we play the where's Asher game where we cover him up with a blanket . 469980_483220
*PAR0:	that's just a version of Pinkaboo yeah . 483600_486200
*PAR0:	and we play super baby where we fly him up in the air while we lie on our backs . 486580_491820
*PAR0:	but is that a game . 491900_493140
*PAR0:	I don't know it's just silly . 493220_495500
*PAR0:	it's just silly because I'm such a good mommy . 495860_506920
*PAR0:	I tell him how cute he is all the time . 506920_509460
*PAR0:	and I tell him when he's done a good job for example when he recently has started &-uh shaking things sometimes instead of sticking it in his mouth . 509460_522280
*PAR0:	always I mean he still sticks them in his mouth a good bit . 522280_525400
*PAR0:	but he'll sometimes shake things instead of sticking them directly in his mouth . 525480_528800
*PAR0:	and I say . 528960_530140
*PAR0:	good you know good shaking Asher it's I try . 530140_533060
*PAR0:	and . 533060_533260
*PAR0:	say the action that he's doing along with the fact that he's doing a good job with it . 533260_538900
*PAR0:	but I tell you you're a good baby a lot . 538900_542080
*PAR0:	yeah you're a good baby . 542080_544340
*PAR0:	mmm yummy . 544340_546000
*PAR0:	&-um &-um let say good jumping . 546000_553220
*PAR0:	oh so do you have any of these specific toys . 553220_564340
*PAR0:	no . 564340_564560
*PAR0:	we &-um we have books . 564560_567000
*PAR0:	and we have some stuffed animals . 567000_568820
*PAR0:	but <none of the> [/] none of the ones like are here . 568820_572020
*PAR0:	most of the stuffed animals he has are actually a little bit larger than those . 572920_577280
*PAR0:	but I actually think he may only have one stuffed animal . 577660_580020
*PAR0:	&-um and <we don't> [/] we don't have plastic food <but we may get some> [/] but we may get some . 581500_589380
*PAR0:	and . 589800_590580
*PAR0:	what about &-um do you think any of do you think he thinks that any of the food items are edible . 590580_596040
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 596480_600540
*PAR0:	and the only reason I would say that is because you know he'll feed himself like puffs or something like that . 601360_612860
*PAR0:	and he seems to approach those differently than he does plastic items that he's just gonna chew on if he did think it I think he figured it out pretty quickly . 612860_624020
*PAR0:	once he stuck it you think I don't know we do use a sippy cup . 624020_634260
*PAR0:	he didn't seem to recognize the bottle . 634500_636540
*PAR0:	he does use a bottle . 636700_637500
*PAR0:	and I showed him this . 637620_638220
*PAR0:	and he didn't seem to recognize the bottle . 638220_639760
*PAR0:	but &-um he also may not be particularly hungry because he was well fed before we got him here . 639760_651540
*PAR0:	so it's hard to you got him . 651540_661600
*PAR0:	okay . 661600_663280
*PAR0:	so I think we're done with the question . 663280_665660
*PAR0:	okay . 665660_666120
*PAR0:	&-um I just want to let you know that like Sabrina said . 666120_669880
*PAR0:	this is gonna . 669880_670320
*PAR0:	happen again . 670320_671880
*PAR0:	for the next two visits . 671880_673440
*PAR0:	I'm gonna stop recording now . 674960_676700
