@Comment:	Chi does not want to write the letter; she asks if Mot can write it for her. When EXP convinces Chi to write the letter , Chi starts to ask Mot to think of ideas. Mot tells Chi to put on her thinking cap. Mot is often distracted by Chi's older Brother , but she gives Chi some suggestions for the letter , and offers to help with spelling. When Chi finishes the letter , she asks if she can read the book. Mot and Chi read the book together out loud.
