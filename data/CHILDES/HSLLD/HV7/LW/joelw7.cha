@Comment:	MOT gives Chi many of the ideas and much of the exact wording for the letter , although Chi does come up with a few of his own ideas. Mot makes sure the form of the letter is correct , with the date and the signature in the right place. Mot corrects Chi's spelling and punctuation as he goes along. Chi asks for the spelling of caterpillar and when Mot does not know , he looks for it on the front of the book. Mot pushes Chi to write nice things in the letter , as opposed to saying the book is weird. Interaction between Mot and Chi is emotionally positive throughout. Towards the end Chi wants to get finished quickly. Chi comments on the difference between his and his brother's writing.
