*PAR0:	he [/] he has the [/] the Mr Brown canoe at home . 24540_28460
*PAR0:	do you have any of the other books at home . 30080_31900
*PAR0:	&-um of these I don't think . 32180_34360

*PAR0:	he looked at the Peekaboo book . 57440_59460
*PAR0:	and then we started with &-uh Mr Brown Camus did he enjoy those I think . 59460_65560
*PAR0:	so I think he's being impatient because they were stuff to explore . 65560_68660
*PAR0:	like normally he sits through the book and wants to read it multiple times . 69040_72000
*PAR0:	like if he decides he wants to read a book . 72400_74480
*PAR0:	if he picks it himself he wants to read it multiple times . 74940_77960
*PAR0:	&-um and he didn't make it through either book . 78700_80840
*PAR0:	so what do you think he was always interested in here . 80840_84940
*PAR0:	not at all interested in the stuffed animals . 85300_87360
*PAR0:	okay . 89520_89860
*PAR0:	not yet is that &-um . 90020_91560
*PAR0:	do you remember from last time . 91560_93040
*PAR0:	is that the same or . 93260_94020

*PAR0:	same . 95120_95540
*PAR0:	yeah . 95900_96180
*PAR0:	like this play food is like his dream come true both times . 96980_101080
*PAR0:	he's like play food . 101080_102500
*PAR0:	what do you think he enjoys about it . 102860_106500
*PAR0:	&-um I think the texture changes different . 106840_109980
*PAR0:	like he's right now he's got a lot of infant toys which are hard plastic or wood or cloth . 110100_116520
*PAR0:	and so this rubber texture I think is rubber . 116720_118840
*PAR0:	and like the m really kind of funny texture is exciting . 118840_123860
*PAR0:	but I think also it looks like food . 124420_126260
*PAR0:	I think he definitely recognizes it as food . 126340_128580
*PAR0:	are there any specific items that you think . 128980_130700
*PAR0:	he recognizes this . 130700_132280
*PAR0:	&-um you know we've been eating a lot of pasta lately we had pasta last night . 132280_136040
*PAR0:	and that's what he wants . 136040_137220
*PAR0:	so that's kind of interesting . 137220_139060
*PAR0:	&-um he definitely recognizes . 139060_141020
*PAR0:	I [/] I don't know we don't eat this kind of cookie . 141020_143480
*PAR0:	but both times he's like very interested in the cookie . 143480_145700
*PAR0:	and I don't know if he recognizes the pizza or if it's a texture thing . 146240_151340
*PAR0:	but he definitely n he knew what to do with this . 151780_154060
*PAR0:	I handed it to him like this . 154100_155300
*PAR0:	and he grabbed it and stuck it in his mouth . 155300_157200
*PAR0:	so you think have you seen this one before . 157320_160260
*PAR0:	have you seen that before . 160740_162600
*PAR0:	would he know the name of it . 162840_163900
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 164980_167820
*PAR0:	I don't think we've had it that much . 168120_169920
*PAR0:	okay . 171680_172480
*PAR0:	&-um do you have any of similar the toys at home . 173240_176680
*PAR0:	we don't have any play food because I know like play food . 176680_181840
*PAR0:	you eat it . 181840_183480
*PAR0:	what you do is you eat food . 183480_185620
*PAR0:	so we've kind of avoided it because we have a lot of kids coming to and from our house . 185620_190080
*PAR0:	and that's a good . 190080_191360
*PAR0:	way to spread disease . 191360_193160
*PAR0:	so we they've they play with it when they go to their friend's houses but not at ours . 193160_196420
*PAR0:	do you have any dolls at home . 197200_198760
*PAR0:	we have one . 199060_200180
*PAR0:	and he's played with it off and on . 200180_205040
*PAR0:	he's usually like less than a minute like he looks at it and recognize like will say it's baby . 205040_210420
*PAR0:	and he's like . 210640_211080
*PAR0:	oh baby . 211080_211960
*PAR0:	and he puts his finger in his mouth or tries to grab its eyes . 212220_214580
*PAR0:	and then he throws it . 214580_215460
*PAR0:	you know it's like . 215460_216120
*PAR0:	that's about it . 216120_216920
*PAR0:	does your older son . 217720_219060
*PAR0:	yes . 219760_220640
*PAR0:	&-um he's [/] he's somewhat interested in dolls more . 220980_223620
*PAR0:	he's interested in figures that can that are m smaller and more manipulatable . 223620_228880
*PAR0:	I think the &-um is that the word easier to manipulate . 229060_232960
*PAR0:	&-um if the doll I think is a little bit too clunky . 232960_235420
*PAR0:	and he's not as excited . 235420_236520
*PAR0:	when he was an infant he wanted the baby all the time to kind of mimic the actions . 237060_242080
*PAR0:	so now that he's bigger and playing he doesn't play with the doll . 242140_245040
*PAR0:	much doesn't make sense . 245040_247380
*PAR0:	&-uh let's see . 248180_249320
*PAR0:	are there any other questions . 249320_252500
*PAR0:	I think we covered them all . 252500_254080
*PAR0:	&-um is there anything that he does at home in terms of playing that we didn't see here . 254080_259180
*PAR0:	well <we do> [/] we do a lot of like patty cake and stuff like that . 259180_262640
*PAR0:	he really enjoys that . 262700_263700
*PAR0:	and he's too interested in the toys to really get you like this texture is this just so fun . 265140_272240
*PAR0:	that is a goofy toy . 272240_274460
*PAR0:	&-um so I think that <we do> [/] we do wordplay . 274460_277760
*PAR0:	and also he I don't know it's [/] it's about the same . 277760_282740
*PAR0:	I'm trying to think like he just . 282740_287640
*PAR0:	doesn't like to play on his tummy . 287640_289000
*PAR0:	that's a big rule . 289020_289940
*PAR0:	like he has to have both hands accessible at all times . 289940_294000
*PAR0:	makes sense . 294000_296700
*PAR0:	alright . 296700_297340
*PAR0:	is there anything else you think we should know in general . 297340_299780
*PAR0:	I don't . 299780_300540
*PAR0:	I mean it's just all normal stuff . 300540_302220
*PAR0:	like he likes to play with somebody . 302220_303740
*PAR0:	and when he's not exploring new toys he likes interactive like contingency games . 303740_309220
*PAR0:	like I throw it you pick it up . 309220_310420
*PAR0:	I throw you pick it up whatever . 310420_311580
*PAR0:	it's pretty normal for the age . 311580_314620
*PAR0:	I think was good I think . 314620_319680
