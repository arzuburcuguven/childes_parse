@Comment:	This mealtime involves fraternal twin brothers , their Mother , and older sister. There is something wrong with either the tape recorder or the tape itself , and many times utterances get cut off or sound garbled and warped. Mostly the family discusses school , the college courses Sis is taking , careers , what subjects the boys are good at , and going out to get ice cream with the coupon they have from Friendly's. Overall , they sound very natural in spite of the tape recorder rolling.
