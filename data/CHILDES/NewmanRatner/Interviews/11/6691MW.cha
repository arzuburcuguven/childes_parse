*PAR0:	sure . 2240_4040
*PAR0:	okay . 4420_6240
*PAR0:	so &-um what do you think that . 6560_8640
*PAR0:	she liked to play with the most today . 8640_11180
*PAR0:	she kept playing with the spoons today . 11320_13140
*PAR0:	kind of an odd choice . 14860_17560
*PAR0:	but yeah [/] yeah she I think she picked up probably every spoon's available . 17560_22060
*PAR0:	is she using that herself at home . 22060_25980
*PAR0:	she's starting to we're starting to have her feed herself sometimes here . 25980_30260
*PAR0:	mhm . 30260_31260
*PAR0:	&-um do you notice any differences between &-um this play session and the last one back in August &-um I think like these are ranked . 31260_43120
*PAR0:	they're spread out like in categories . 43120_44720
*PAR0:	so like all the books are in a section the stuffed animals and all the food &-um toys . 44720_51180
*PAR0:	and she just kinda played mostly with the food toys more often . 51180_56080
*PAR0:	I think the doll might be different . 56080_58300
*PAR0:	but in regards to her obviously she's walking around . 58300_61640
*PAR0:	so you know I would think she would play it more because she can get to more . 61640_66300
*PAR0:	but it's mostly the food items . 66300_68220
*PAR0:	okay . 68220_68640
*PAR0:	mhm . 69320_69640
*PAR0:	are there &-um items there in the food that you think that she recognizes or that the names of or recognizes a look of or that she's eating &-um she eats peas but she doesn't eat ice cream waffles pizza hamburgers . 69940_87000
*PAR0:	yeah . 87000_89440
*PAR0:	the only thing would be the peas in the spoon in the cup that she would recognize . 89780_95640
*PAR0:	yeah . 95640_96100
*PAR0:	yeah . 98020_99000
*PAR0:	<do you> [/] do you think there are words that she &-um or items that she feels like she's just beginning to learn what they are . 99000_107380
*PAR0:	&-um so the plates &-um for sure . 107380_119200
*PAR0:	&-um she didn't . 119200_123180
*PAR0:	ha she just got a baby doll . 123180_124740
*PAR0:	so she's not quite I think she's learning to . 124740_128160
*PAR0:	know what a baby doll is . 128580_129840
*PAR0:	because she [/] she just got one &-uh let's see what . 130000_135260
*PAR0:	pooka dooks . 135440_136040
*PAR0:	how is she playing with &-uh baby doll at home . 136400_141600
*PAR0:	&-um she'll just pick it up and look at it . 142260_147860
*PAR0:	she might play it for maybe a minute . 148060_150160
*PAR0:	and then she'll play with blocks or &-um a rattle or something . 150780_155940
*PAR0:	mhm . 156580_156880
*PAR0:	okay . 157320_157620
*PAR0:	you &-um began with dressing the baby or [/] or feeding the baby or also &-um I can't think of the other word but you just began to show her how to you know with the baby doll . 158900_173400
*PAR0:	no I [/] I haven haven't not yet . 173520_175480
*PAR0:	oh I was gonna say labeling body parts and those types of things . 175480_179860
*PAR0:	I actually used to do that with her but I haven't &-um really started with the baby doll . 179860_185380
*PAR0:	yeah . 185380_186200
*PAR0:	we do it with &-um our dog and our cat but not with the baby [/] baby doll yet . 186200_192460
*PAR0:	oh cool . 192600_193160
*PAR0:	mhm . 193340_193660
*PAR0:	either &-um if he's like familiar or if you were to tell her to look at certain things . 195040_199840
*PAR0:	would she be familiar on her own body or in or with the or she just would have been looking at all the different parts you mean on her or on something else . 199840_208520
*PAR0:	&-um like if I say wear his eyes will she point out the eyes that what you is that what you mean . 209440_214800
*PAR0:	yeah . 214980_215120
*PAR0:	yeah . 215200_215360
*PAR0:	sometimes if she's not you know distracted &-um the ears she easily points out . 215360_220140
*PAR0:	but I think that's because she's attracted to the ears or the tail . 220140_223840
*PAR0:	so she'll do that &-um but not consistently yet . 224260_228800
*PAR0:	okay . 229320_229580
*PAR0:	mhm . 229760_230020
*PAR0:	oh [/] oh . 230400_231500
*PAR0:	oopsie doopsies . 231680_232360
*PAR0:	you . 232940_233380
*PAR0:	alright . 233380_233600
*PAR0:	oh that's a big girl . 234380_235820
*PAR0:	mhm . 236280_236540
*PAR0:	&-um did you play with any of the stuffed animals today . 237040_240020
*PAR0:	&-um she picked up one but that was it . 240380_245840
*PAR0:	and I think it wasn't even really a stuffed animal . 245920_247920
*PAR0:	I think it was the letter e somewhere . 248000_250180
*PAR0:	yeah it was that letter e was really it . 250180_254240
*PAR0:	mhm . 255560_255760
*PAR0:	is she into is that different from at home . 255760_257600
*PAR0:	yeah she well she has stuffed animals but she doesn't really play with those either . 257760_261260
*PAR0:	yeah . 262160_262540
*PAR0:	&-um the things she plays with regularly at home is &-uh &-um a kitchen set a &-um like a [/] a table thing that has different things . 262540_275000
*PAR0:	you can pull and push and turn . 275000_276860
*PAR0:	and [/] and then &-um what else is she playing with . 276860_282380
*PAR0:	and then like random things like we still have her swing set up . 282860_287340
*PAR0:	but she likes to push the swing or &-um if there's a cup like a random cup she'll play with the cup . 287340_295200
*PAR0:	we almost shouldn't even buy toys because she'll play with like crazy stuff . 295200_299440
*PAR0:	or she'll play with a pillow or just you know what's ever there . 299440_303080
*PAR0:	we usually only have like three or four toys out at a time . 303080_306780
*PAR0:	but &-um oh and she'll play with balls . 306780_309140
*PAR0:	what do you think she likes about &-um playing like [/] like as far as like color texture noise . 310400_317320
*PAR0:	she likes &-um bright colors . 318500_321080
*PAR0:	and I actually think she likes like the simpler the toy the better like if it if it's designed to do something she gets bored with it quicker than if it's just nothing like she'll take &-um at school . 321700_338500
*PAR0:	she'll take puzzle pieces and bang those together all day . 338500_342140
*PAR0:	long but there'll be a leap frog sophisticated learning toy . 342140_346680
*PAR0:	and she'll hardly touch it . 346680_347860
*PAR0:	&-um I put them bright colors that's the uses of comma denominator and everything . 348040_352420
*PAR0:	hey baby hi [/] hi [/] hi [/] hi &-um if you're beginning to understand like your &-um your like negative side of things . 353020_368780
*PAR0:	mhm . 368780_369160
*PAR0:	mhm . 369160_370440
*PAR0:	yeah I think half of it's the tone of voice . 370440_373540
*PAR0:	mhm . 374140_374420
*PAR0:	I'm sure I could say chocolate chip <in a> [/] in a you know a mean way . 374720_378280
*PAR0:	and she'll know that something's wrong . 378280_380440
*PAR0:	but in general she doesn't once they stop don't touch she'll recognize that a good girl or yay . 380540_386700
*PAR0:	she'll recognize that as well very easily . 387040_388540
*PAR0:	okay . 388840_389060
*PAR0:	&-um how were you playing with the food today . 390340_395120
*PAR0:	were there was there like a certain way that you were presenting it to her or playing with her to get her engage in them . 395280_402980
*PAR0:	well I sh I was just letting her pick whatever she wanted . 402980_405640
*PAR0:	and then I would just kinda tsk tell her the name of it . 405920_408700
*PAR0:	mhm . 409260_409380
*PAR0:	&-um so she picked up the pizzas often . 409380_412500
*PAR0:	&-um even though she didn't really play with it . 413180_414800
*PAR0:	but every time she picked up a pizza or peas or ice cream I just you know tell her the name of it . 414980_421980
*PAR0:	but &-um you know she [/] she hasn't she's never eaten pizza or ice cream . 422440_427000
*PAR0:	so I'm not sure if that's gonna really register . 427100_429520
*PAR0:	great . 429960_430400
*PAR0:	hi baby &-um how about &-uh the things that she is eating or manipulating here &-um at home like real or [/] or pretends . 431000_440980
*PAR0:	well you know she eats peas all the time . 441300_443400
*PAR0:	but she hardly plays . 443480_444280
*PAR0:	with these peas . 444280_444960
*PAR0:	so I guess maybe it doesn't make a difference . 445100_446860
*PAR0:	&-um but then again her peas are mashed up . 448600_450580
*PAR0:	so maybe that's why she didn't recognize it . 450740_453760
*PAR0:	and you had about things that she has at home that are here . 454720_457540
*PAR0:	yeah . 457880_458200
*PAR0:	like I was thinking also like the cup there . 458200_461140
*PAR0:	oh well good point cause she s immediately started drinking from the bottle and drinking from the cup . 461840_467620
*PAR0:	mhm . 467940_468100
*PAR0:	and I think because we have books at home . 468200_469700
*PAR0:	&-um but she clearly wasn't interested in the books today . 470200_472580
*PAR0:	but usually when we break out a book we don't have you know toys around for her to you know so the book has no competition . 472940_479760
*PAR0:	usually . 479760_481200
*PAR0:	yeah . 481200_481440
*PAR0:	so &-um that was different . 481440_483460
*PAR0:	but clearly she recognized the cup and the bottle and the spoon all those . 483600_487500
*PAR0:	when she saw it she immediately put it in her mouth . 487500_489640
*PAR0:	&-um but she does it with a comb too . 490320_493160
*PAR0:	I don't see a comb . 493240_493920
*PAR0:	if she has a comb she'll immediately start to brush her hair . 494360_497260
*PAR0:	there's a towel . 497400_498020
*PAR0:	she'll immediately put it to her cheek or a telephone . 498020_502440
*PAR0:	and she'll pick it up and try to say . 502900_504460
*PAR0:	hello . 504460_504660
*PAR0:	do you have any of the same books at home . 505480_507520
*PAR0:	no . 507840_508540
*PAR0:	but I have a similar book to the Peekaboo book . 508540_511060
*PAR0:	it's just the &-um belly button book . 511320_513680
*PAR0:	yeah &-um yeah the words are different . 514100_517700
*PAR0:	&-um which book did you &-uh try to get her into . 518880_522700
*PAR0:	I tried to do this one . 522700_525840
*PAR0:	put me in the zoo . 525840_526800
*PAR0:	&-um but she wasn't interested in the book today . 527660_531480
*PAR0:	no I mean she looked at it probably . 531840_534200
*PAR0:	for five seconds in and out . 534200_535560
*PAR0:	and she moved on to another toy . 535560_536980
*PAR0:	do you think the books at home . 537680_539160
*PAR0:	kind of I mean what do you think would have interested her in that book . 539160_543920
*PAR0:	like the rhyming or the colors or the animals or like subject matter &-um colors . 543920_551820
*PAR0:	but I usually try to get books with really big words so she could see the word . 551820_557080
*PAR0:	and I try to point out whatever the word is . 557080_559740
*PAR0:	and I try point out what it is on the picture . 559740_562120
*PAR0:	&-um let's see . 562120_565760
*PAR0:	and maybe the color . 565760_566900
*PAR0:	but I mean again you know this book had a lot of competition . 566900_571240
*PAR0:	so maybe this book isn't getting a fighting chance . 571240_574300
*PAR0:	yeah . 574600_575480
*PAR0:	did you play with &-um anything else here &-um aside for because sometimes there are some random things in with like the different categories . 575780_587520
*PAR0:	&-um I tried to play with the baby doll . 588520_590800
*PAR0:	&-um after showing her that she's supposed to give the baby a bottle . 591940_596880
*PAR0:	eventually she did &-uh I don't know if she played she picked up the clock . 597160_604340
*PAR0:	but she didn't really play with it at all . 604340_605880
*PAR0:	&-um she picked up a jars of &-um I think peanut butter . 606400_610340
*PAR0:	and I think she really just picked those up so that she could bang them together . 610640_614720
*PAR0:	mhm . 615160_615400
*PAR0:	and she did . 616140_619400
*PAR0:	and she said in kind of like her release items . 619520_622180
*PAR0:	it sounds like the things &-uh she did she play with your keys at home . 622180_627520
*PAR0:	yes she does . 628220_628920
*PAR0:	mhm . 629660_629880
*PAR0:	and she did play with these &-uh not quite as much as the spoon . 630460_633760
*PAR0:	&-um but my kids you know are metal and all on a ring . 633760_638100
*PAR0:	so I'm not sure she recognized . 638100_639500
*PAR0:	those keys or not . 639500_641620
*PAR0:	yeah . 641620_641920
*PAR0:	mhm yeah . 641920_643160
*PAR0:	because I would think they would agree with each other . 643160_644800
*PAR0:	just a little bit . 644800_645860
*PAR0:	mhm . 645860_646560
*PAR0:	different . 646560_647140
*PAR0:	can you play with items were popular last time too . 647700_674780
*PAR0:	she plays that with people . 675200_678260
*PAR0:	Miss Carmen I think she plays with people like that . 678700_681300
*PAR0:	&-uh and I think she also recognized the bottle on the cuff line . 681900_686760
*PAR0:	so &-um I just wanted to know if any other questions about &-um <she didn't like> [/] she didn't like the &-uh the stuff I downloaded earlier . 687540_705180
*PAR0:	did you try to &-uh you know get her or did you just throw it in her face . 705360_708400
*PAR0:	no I just let her play with whatever she was playing with . 708400_711740
*PAR0:	now while we were talking she just spread them out . 712060_714280
*PAR0:	but that was it . 714580_715160
*PAR0:	&-um oh one of the things she like she does like to do is &-um if there are a bunch of toys in a container she likes to just pull them out . 715860_723480
*PAR0:	not necessarily play with the toys but the actual playing is pulling them out . 723880_728500
*PAR0:	so when we were to talk I did see her come to this pile and just [/] just spread the toys out . 728500_735240
*PAR0:	yeah . 735420_737000
*PAR0:	she did just dive into them at some point . 737400_739220
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 739240_739620
*PAR0:	yeah . 739820_740240
*PAR0:	so . 741080_741820
*PAR0:	yeah . 741820_742160
*PAR0:	okay . 743680_744000
*PAR0:	and is she still is she &-um I think you actually said is she &-uh drinking from a bottle or a cup . 744520_750080
*PAR0:	and she drinks from cups now . 750080_752220
*PAR0:	okay . 752480_752720
*PAR0:	mhm . 753060_753240
*PAR0:	&-uh she probably hasn't drank from a bottle probably in a couple of months . 754380_758380
*PAR0:	okay . 759780_760220
*PAR0:	so did you miss it . 760680_762300
*PAR0:	you missed the bottle . 763440_767220
*PAR0:	you missed the bottle . 767220_771420
*PAR0:	okay . 771420_776200
*PAR0:	&-um you just put your head first . 776200_779640
