@Comment:	This is an uneventful mealtime , with Chi , MOT , and Bro. At first , it seems as if Chi is reluctant to speak , but is encouraged by his mother. Chi talks about going outside to help a neighbor shovel snow , while his mother sees homework as a higher priority. Chi does not know the word priority , and Mot explains its meaning in this context to him. They also discuss an award Chi won in school for listening skills. Bro adds little to the discussion , chiming in only to tease Chi or add comments; MT is short , about 8:20
