*PAR0:	&-um do you think she recognized the names of any of the animals . 197800_202460
*PAR0:	I think . 202460_203960
*PAR0:	yeah . 203960_204480
*PAR0:	&-um the dog I mean I think she recognizes dog . 204480_210740
*PAR0:	&-um whether she picked up that these were dogs I'm not sure dog . 210740_216400
*PAR0:	and she recognizes Winnie the pooh . 217040_219420
*PAR0:	which I'm kinda I didn't think we were . 219420_222640
*PAR0:	I didn't think she had that much exposure to Winnie The pooh . 223340_225600
*PAR0:	we don't spend a lot of time with Winnie the pooh . 225680_227120
*PAR0:	but &-um and let's see what else . 227460_232600
*PAR0:	&-um yeah I mean if there was like a oh the rooster . 232600_236340
*PAR0:	yeah I think she probably recognizes the rooster . 236340_240880
*PAR0:	okay . 241800_242300
*PAR0:	which one would be &-uh would a chihuahua . 243060_245440
*PAR0:	or poodle . 245440_245960
*PAR0:	be more typical of a dog that she's seen . 245960_249020
*PAR0:	&-um probably the chihuahua . 249340_251680
*PAR0:	where did it go under the . 252640_253880
*PAR0:	oh yeah [/] yeah . 253900_254740
*PAR0:	something like this versus this . 255120_257780
*PAR0:	yeah . 258040_259180
*PAR0:	pink fur is it all . 259300_260160
*PAR0:	yeah . 260180_260560
*PAR0:	yeah . 260880_261540
*PAR0:	kind of the f the furriness of it . 261840_263940
*PAR0:	yeah . 264200_264460
*PAR0:	although she doesn't I mean she has stuffed animals . 265180_267500
*PAR0:	but she doesn't spend a lot of time playing with them per se . 267500_271820
*PAR0:	the so the animals are more like puzzle pieces or in the books . 272020_274600
*PAR0:	mhm . 274880_275140
*PAR0:	so it's &-uh this would the coloring of this one definitely would be more along the lines of what she's seen . 275320_281140
*PAR0:	so at home does she like toys more than books or books more than toys right now . 281840_286980
*PAR0:	it's all about books . 286980_290020
*PAR0:	it's definitely about books . 290020_291920
*PAR0:	okay . 291920_292300
*PAR0:	and then here but here she's more about the toys . 292300_296060
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 296060_297180
*PAR0:	which &-uh makes me wonder if &-um . 297180_302220
*PAR0:	well I don't know . 302220_303920
*PAR0:	we try and shake it up . 303920_304940
*PAR0:	you know . 304940_305260
*PAR0:	so like her stuffed animals have been buried into her little basket . 305260_309300
*PAR0:	and so maybe it's time to recycle the toys . 309300_314400
*PAR0:	bring them to the top again . 314400_316320
*PAR0:	they've gotten kind of buried . 316320_318180
*PAR0:	she has blocks at home that she plays with that aren't here . 318180_321120
*PAR0:	so I don't know . 321120_324140
*PAR0:	maybe it's just that they were a little bit different . 324140_325660
*PAR0:	and that attracted her attention . 325660_327780
*PAR0:	yeah . 327780_328640
*PAR0:	could be the colors too . 328640_330400
*PAR0:	yeah . 330400_330760
*PAR0:	yeah . 330760_331400
*PAR0:	&-um does she play with the keys . 331400_338380
*PAR0:	&-uh she played with them here a little bit . 338380_341860
*PAR0:	but she doesn't have anything like that at home . 341860_344560
*PAR0:	mm . 344740_344880
*PAR0:	so she seemed to she likes to she gets into the kitchen cupboards . 345820_349780
*PAR0:	and so kind of the plastic reminded me of it . 349780_352020
*PAR0:	the shaking the noise that she'll make with like the tupperware and stuff . 352100_354800
*PAR0:	&-um so <I don't> [/] I don't know if it's the toys or she likes to pick things up and just kind of flail with them . 355780_364220
*PAR0:	yeah . 364720_365620
*PAR0:	what would you say was her least favorite &-um the doll . 366400_371220
*PAR0:	she really kind of looked at that with a I don't think she was quite sure what to make of the doll . 371420_376840
*PAR0:	mhm . 376900_377160
*PAR0:	and &-uh she &-uh she doesn't have a doll at home . 377800_380480
*PAR0:	Exc well she just got one from the nanny . 380600_382680
*PAR0:	&-um which is a little bit smaller than this one . 382680_385460
*PAR0:	this one's more life size for her . 385560_388560
*PAR0:	yeah . 389280_389420
*PAR0:	&-um but she hasn't really paid much attention even to the [/] the doll at home . 389960_393960
*PAR0:	so I might be a little too early for a doll . 394640_397420
*PAR0:	but this one I don't think she was quite sure what to make of the doll . 399140_405980
*PAR0:	yeah she eats peas . 405980_416820
*PAR0:	she's had some waffles cut up . 416820_420460
*PAR0:	&-um she she's had a couple of finger fulls of ice . 420460_425420
*PAR0:	cream . 425420_425800
*PAR0:	&-um she's had some pasta but not spaghetti that was cut up but oh and cheese . 425800_435500
*PAR0:	yeah but not shaped like this . 435500_437440
*PAR0:	I mean I don't know that she'd pick up that this was cheese . 437440_440060
*PAR0:	did you pick up that . 440060_440800
*PAR0:	that's cheese . 440800_445920
*PAR0:	&-uh so that's probably about it . 445920_450680
*PAR0:	I mean she's had bread . 450680_451680
*PAR0:	but again it's not [/] not usually shaped like this . 451680_456260
*PAR0:	by the time she sees it it's you know in teeny tiny little . 456260_459400
*PAR0:	so &-uh what about spoons is she stirring in teeny spoons when she eats &-um <she tries> [/] she tries . 459400_467580
*PAR0:	but &-um we've kinda moved away from the puree . 467580_471700
*PAR0:	and . 471900_472040
*PAR0:	so [/] so she's getting a lot of finger foods now . 472040_474260
*PAR0:	and but &-um yeah if she sees us eating sometimes we'll just give her the spoon . 474520_480340
*PAR0:	and she kind of plays with it . 480340_481820
