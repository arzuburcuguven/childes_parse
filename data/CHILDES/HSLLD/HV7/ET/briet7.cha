@Comment:	MOT and Chi seem to get along , but they do not play together at all. Chi asks about three times during the activity if they are done yet. EXP stays in the background. Mot and Chi work independently for the most part throughout the activity. Mot tries to introduce the qualities of magnets to Chi a few times , for example by showing Chi how the balls repel each other , but Chi is not interested. There is some brief talk about how the thin refrigerator-type magnets aren't strong , that they <don't have enough magnet in them>. Chi does ask if everything is a magnet , but there isn't much discussion around this. MOT and Chi sit on a couch; the magnets and other toys (turtle , lego pieces , etc.) are on a coffee table in front of them; Chi is removing objects from the black base
*INV:	oh .
*CHI:	(be)cause they're poisonous .
*MOT:	yeah [=? well] &-um (.) I don't know why .
*CHI:	(be)cause they're poisonous !
*MOT:	this size ?
*CHI:	yes .
*MOT:	I never heard that before .
*CHI:	somebody told me .
*MOT:	at the pet store ?
*CHI:	yes .
*CHI:	actually at the +//.
*CHI:	Carol [!] said they were .
*CHI:	mom will you let me do it [= remove objects from the base] ?
%sit:	MOT is reaching over to help Chi remove objects from the base
*MOT:	well Chi I just wanted to help .
*MOT:	+^ (be)cause I wanted to see what these things [= thin , flat refrigerator-type magnets] were .
*CHI:	it's my day okay ?
*MOT:	okay .
*CHI:	look at this thing [= black base magnet] .
%act:	holds the base magnet in one hand; on top of it rests a white ball; Chi moves the base in a circular motion , watching the white ball move around on the base
*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	(..) oh !
%act:	picks up a paper clip with the yellow wand , and then removes the paper clip and places it back on the coffee table
*CHI:	oh !
%act:	picks the paper clip back up with the wand , removes it , and places it back on the coffee table
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	+^ only two [= balls] can stick together .
%act:	attempts to pick up the orange and white ball with the red ball; neither the orange or the white ball will attach to the red ball
*CHI:	I have one of these [= yellow wands] .
*MOT:	you might have a green one .
*MOT:	oh my god .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	picks up a washer with the yellow wand
%com:	the wand already has four washers on it and no other objects
*CHI:	hm: .
%act:	picks up a nut and a silver stick with they yellow wand; removes these from the wand
*CHI:	(.) oh !
%act:	picks up a washer and a silver man with the wand; removes the silver man
*MOT:	hm: [=? sure] .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	rearranges a washer on the yellow wand
*CHI:	mom she asked me to play with the xxx .
%act:	places the silver stick on the yellow wand
%int:	whispered
*MOT:	xxx ?
%add:	EXP
*INV:	oh yeah .
*INV:	it's [/] it's [= magnet set , maybe] for both of you .
*MOT:	<tell the xxx> [>] .
*INV:	<to do together> [<] .
*INV:	mhm .
*CHI:	(.) can I have this long thing [= the silver stick] ?
*MOT:	you can have whatever you want .
%act:	sits back onto the couch; then moves to the table again and moves some of the objects around and touches them together
*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	(.) look [=? mom] .
%act:	holds up the yellow wand with two washers and a silver stick placed diagonally between them on two opposite sides of the wand; the washer and stick arrangement looks like a percent sign
*MOT:	what ?
*MOT:	it's just making a design ?
*CHI:	no .
*MOT:	well if they're the (.) same on both sides +...
*MOT:	I think that's what a design +/.
*CHI:	+^ percent !
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	percent sign .
*MOT:	oh .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	hits his forehead with the yellow wand , crosses his eyes; the duh gesture
*MOT:	okay .
*MOT:	+^ I get you .
*MOT:	now maybe someone is brilliant .
*CHI:	neither did I but I could still figure it [= percent sign] out .
*MOT:	I know &=laughs .
*MOT:	but I can't !
*CHI:	(o)kay now if we pick up the nuts .
%act:	picks up a nut with the yellow wand
*CHI:	wrong [?] nut .
%act:	picks up an object which isn't a nut; removes it from the wand
*CHI:	alright &=sigh .
*CHI:	that's all the big ones [= large nuts] .
%sit:	Chi has picked up all the large nuts with the yellow wand
*CHI:	&=sings .
*MOT:	let me see the box [= black base] .
%act:	reaches across Chi to get the base magnet
*MOT:	there must be a magnet in [!] the box [= black base] .
*CHI:	no duh .
%int:	mumbled
*CHI:	well I didn't know that either .
*MOT:	(..) oh I like watching these [= balls on black base] .
*MOT:	watch .
%act:	pushes a ball so that it hits into the other balls; the balls move around on the black base
*MOT:	I like those [= magnetic balls] .
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	(.) xxx .
%act:	moves the black base closer to Chi in order to better show him how the balls move on the base
*CHI:	whoops !
%act:	holds the yellow wand in one hand; on top of the wand was a pyramid of nuts and washers; with the other hand , Chi picks up the flat silver circle and moves it toward the bottom of the yellow wand; the silver circle sticks to the wand and part of the pyramid falls
*CHI:	don't !
*CHI:	wasn't sposta happen .
%act:	removes the silver circle from the wand , and works on setting the pyramid back up
*CHI:	sorry .
%add:	the fallen pyramid
*CHI:	xxx .
%act:	removes all the pieces from the wand and begins making a new structure
*CHI:	yes .
*MOT:	(.) try to get off all these xxx .
%act:	closes hand around the balls on the magnetic base , and then releases them; magnetic repulsion keeps the balls from staying together when Mot releases them; they quickly spread out on the base
*CHI:	(o)kay Timmy O_Toole .
*MOT:	I'm not Timmy O_Toole .
*MOT:	watch .
*MOT:	watch .
*CHI:	I don't care .
*CHI:	I'm making my own design .
*CHI:	are these [= referent unclear] all magnets ?
*MOT:	what ?
*MOT:	I think just the bar is .
*MOT:	oh you got it .
*MOT:	I think just the bar [= yellow wand] is .
*MOT:	not these [= washers and silver pieces] (be)cause they're not sticking to each_other .
%act:	picks up two washers and rubs them together to demonstrate
*CHI:	(.) don't .
%act:	removes pieces from the yellow wand
*CHI:	+^ I was tryin(g) to make something else .
*CHI:	now I know .
*CHI:	&=sings .
*CHI:	(..) &=whistles .
%act:	stacks nuts on top of each other on the wand; then moves to put a silver stick into the middle of the nuts; the tower falls
*CHI:	stop that !
%add:	the fallen tower
*MOT:	I can't get this guy [= silver man] to stand up .
%sit:	MOT can't get a silver man to stand up on the black base; the flat silver circle which allows the men to stand easily isn't on the base
*CHI:	do I care ?
*MOT:	there .
*MOT:	I got one [= a silver men to stand] .
*CHI:	am I sposta care mom ?
*CHI:	Cheryl .
*CHI:	aren't you gonna call Cheryl to see ?
*MOT:	<nope I'm not> [=? not right now] .
*CHI:	(.) how long am I sposta play with these [= magnets] ?
%add:	EXP
*CHI:	&-uh wasn't sposta do that .
%act:	places a silver ball on top of the tower of nuts and then removes the ball
*MOT:	it's gonna stick to this .
*CHI:	(.) yes !
%act:	puts a silver stick into the middle of the tower of nuts; this time the tower doesn't fall
%int:	whispered
*MOT:	that [= blue plastic bear] doesn't stick to anything .
*CHI:	&-uh +/.
%act:	removes a silver stick from the black base
*CHI:	xxx [>] .
*MOT:	<neither does this [= referent unclear]> [<] .
%act:	sets the plastic turtle and the blue bear side by side on the coffee table
*MOT:	neither does this [= blue arrow magnet] .
%act:	taps the blue arrow on the black base , but has trouble making them stick
*CHI:	my name is xxx .
%act:	puts a second silver stick in the middle of the tower of nuts
*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	it [= blue arrow] sticks to this [= yellow wand] .
%act:	takes the arrow and places it on the yellow wand
*MOT:	+^ I know but how come nothing else will [>] stick to this [= black base] ?
*CHI:	mom [<] .
%act:	touches the blue arrow to the black base
*MOT:	what ?
*MOT:	it's [= blue arrow] not really sticking (be)cause it's like (.) I used all the (.) magnet's [= black base] power .
*MOT:	+^ it's [= blue arrow's] not +...
*MOT:	it's [= blue arrow] like to big to stick .
*CHI:	xxx .
%act:	holds the wand high in the air and turns it upside down; the tower of nuts and the silver sticks remain in place
*MOT:	looks like a tool [= tower of nuts on the wand] .
*CHI:	xxx .
%act:	points tower of nuts towards Mot's face
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	<look into my eyes> [>] .
*CHI:	0 [<] .
%act:	points the tower at Mot's face , near her eyes
*MOT:	+^ get out !
%sit:	MOT turns her head away , Chi stands the tower of nuts on the table
*CHI:	(o)kay .
*CHI:	we done now ?
%add:	EXP
*INV:	(.) almost .
*CHI:	(.) now my turn .
%act:	removes the nuts from the yellow wand; the silver sticks remain
*CHI:	I get to set up my xxx .
*CHI:	this still +//.
*CHI:	ahhah !
%sit:	one of the silver sticks stands straight up , perpendicular to the wand
*CHI:	whoops !
%sit:	the standing silver stick falls
*CHI:	+^ I was talented for a second .
*CHI:	I'm talented !
%act:	holds out the wand with the silver stick on top; the silver stick is standing
%int:	singing
*MOT:	well I got the guy [= silver man] to stand up first .
*MOT:	then he [= silver man] xxx +...
*CHI:	&-uh +...
%act:	takes the silver man and stands him on the yellow wand
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	well stand him [= silver man] on this [= black base] .
*MOT:	(.) &-uh he's [= silver man's] kind of (.) laying over .
%sit:	the silver man isn't standing straight up; it leans slightly
*MOT:	this magnet [= one in the black base] is really strong in this box [= black base] .
*MOT:	oh I could lean (h)im [= silver man] and do it [= stand the silver man in a leaning position] too .
%sit:	both Chi and Mot work with their own silver men , each one trying to get his or her silver man to stand; Chi points to his man indicating that it is standing , but it isn't straignt up; Mot wants the silver men to be standing straight up
*MOT:	feel how &~stro +//.
*MOT:	when you put this [= silver man] down [= on black base] feel it [= magnetic force] (.) pullin(g) .
%sit:	MOT demonstrates and Chi follows Mot's lead
*MOT:	can you feel it [= black base] pulling him [= silver man] ?
*MOT:	xxx &=laughs .
*MOT:	feel right here [= a certain spot on the black base] where this [= her silver man] is .
*CHI:	mom I don't care !
*CHI:	okay .
*CHI:	+^ are we done now ?
*CHI:	I just wanna get this over !
*CHI:	put that one [= washer] there [= on a nut on the black base] .
%act:	picks up various objects from the table and puts them on the black base
*CHI:	do these [= dimes] stick here [= on black base] ?
%act:	tosses a dime on the black base; the dime falls off the base
*MOT:	nope .
*CHI:	huh ?
*MOT:	I don't think so .
*MOT:	none of these [= thin , refrigerator-type magnets] xxx is sticking (.) on anything .
%act:	picks up the thin , square , checkerboard magnet from the flat silver circle and touches it to the yellow wand and the black base
*MOT:	it's [= square , thin magnet] not sticking on that [= black base or yellow wand] either .
%act:	drops the square magnet on the yellow wand
*CHI:	these [= thin magnets] ?
%act:	picks up the thin square magnet
*CHI:	<these [= thin magnets] are magnets that we stick on the refrigerator> [>] .
*MOT:	<well those [= thin magnets] xxx> [<] +...
*MOT:	+^ I know .
*MOT:	+^ but <they're not> [//] they'd [= thin magnets] stick to that [= yellow wand] too but there not enough magnet in them .
%sit:	MOT stacks washers and nuts on the black base while Chi tries to get the thin square magnet to stick to the yellow wand
*CHI:	oh .
*CHI:	+^ oh oh what_about this one [= flat silver circle] ?
%act:	puts the thin square magnet on the flat silver circle
*MOT:	xxx .
*CHI:	ah ah .
%act:	holds the flat silver circle high in the air and turns it upside down; the thin square magnet stays attached to the flat silver circle
*CHI:	+^ I'm talented mom .
*CHI:	you're not .
*MOT:	I know .
*CHI:	&=sings .
*MOT:	xxx one [= referent unclear] ?
*CHI:	&=sings .
%act:	removes thin square from the silver circle and puts the blue arrow onto the silver circle
*CHI:	(wh)oops .
*CHI:	+^ wrong way .
%act:	turns the arrow over so that the black side of the arrow is touching the silver circle; the arrow attaches to the silver circle
%com:	the arrow is a magnet painted blue on one side only; the painted side does not stick well
*CHI:	yeah +...
*CHI:	xxx it's [= blue arrow] not sticking to anything .
%int:	sarcasm
*MOT:	it [= blue arrow] wasn't sticking to this [= black base] .
*MOT:	+^ I didn't say it [= blue arrow] wouldn't stick to anything .
*CHI:	(o)kay .
*CHI:	which one [= of the thin triangle and square magnets] are we gonna [: going to] pick ?
%act:	puts the triangle and square in a line
*CHI:	never_mind .
%act:	brushes the triangle and square away
*CHI:	(.) this one [= a coin] !
%act:	slides a coin into the twelve o'clock position next to the silver circle
*CHI:	this one [= coin] [=? little] penny .
%act:	slides a coin into the nine o'clock position next to the silver circle
%int:	singing
*CHI:	this one [= coin] or +...
%act:	slides a coin into the three o'clock position next to the silver circle
%int:	singing
*CHI:	+, this one [= coin] .
%act:	slides a coin into the six o'clock position next to the silver circle
*CHI:	(.) ready ?
%act:	spins the silver circle , which has the blue arrow on top of it , so that the arrow points to one of the coins
*MOT:	hm: .
*MOT:	Chi xxx .
%sit:	two silver sticks stand on the black base in the middle of a tower of nuts and washers; a silver man stands with one foot on top of one of the silver sticks; Mot is trying to get another silver man to stand on the other silver stick , but it falls
*MOT:	<almost had it [= second silver man standing on the second silver stick]> [>] .
%com:	<$=12> Mot and Chi are each doing their own thing; Mot is making a tower on the black base and Chi is spinning the silver circle with the blue arrow on top of it; each time the arrow ends up pointing at one of the coins , Chi removes the coin from its position
*CHI:	<alright> [<] .
*CHI:	&=vocalization .
%act:	spins the silver circle
*MOT:	xxx .
