*PAR0:	but yeah the more like common ones . 128360_131960
*PAR0:	I'm sure he &-um recognized you said you &-um you might know some from books you guys like to read a lot . 131960_138400
*PAR0:	yeah . 138400_138580
*PAR0:	we &-um well we used to live right across the street from the library . 138580_141280
*PAR0:	so we almost went . 141280_142840
*PAR0:	we probably went three times a week to story hours and different things . 142840_146480
*PAR0:	and &-um we go through a lot of books . 146480_149060
*PAR0:	so &-um yeah he any books with animals . 149060_152500
*PAR0:	that's &-um predominantly where he would get . 152500_156100
*PAR0:	he's only been to the zoo once . 156280_157380
*PAR0:	so it's mostly books . 157380_158780
*PAR0:	mhm . 159520_159720
*PAR0:	and some of these animals are kinda like . 160200_161740
*PAR0:	I don't know the names . 161740_162960
*PAR0:	some of them either more exotic . 163060_164300
*PAR0:	right . 164480_164800
*PAR0:	yeah sometimes like they've seen them on tv or something . 165160_167740
*PAR0:	yeah he seems like he knows like when we were doing the &-um picture the picture book [/] book before [/] before like he [/] he knows [/] knows the [/] the n sounds the sounds they [/] they make [/] make sometimes [/] sometimes but [/] but not [/] not always [/] always the [/] the name or . 168040_177040
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah we did . 177040_178340
*PAR0:	&-um I think he he's been able to communicate a lot with sounds or like sign language . 178340_186300
*PAR0:	whether it's a f we did a quick sign language class at the library . 186300_189600
*PAR0:	and so some of that he learned like either he made up signs or the actual signs or just body language . 189600_196780
*PAR0:	so like monkey you know he does this or the bird . 196780_201920
*PAR0:	he says . 201920_202280
*PAR0:	Tweet tweet . 202280_202820
*PAR0:	so and some of that it's like old habits . 202820_207000
*PAR0:	maybe I'm being a little too like I know he says . 207000_210540
*PAR0:	Tweet [/] Tweet I know it's a bird . 210540_211660
*PAR0:	so instead of like asking him say bird I'm just like . 211660_214840
*PAR0:	yeah bird you know . 214840_215920
*PAR0:	&-um but <I think that's> [/] I think that's how most kids kind of they start with the sound . 215920_220500
*PAR0:	yeah . 220520_220560
*PAR0:	okay . 220560_220760
*PAR0:	and then eventually they kind of right . 220880_222320
*PAR0:	&-um yeah he like when you showed him a picture of the cat he said . 222560_226960
*PAR0:	meow first . 226960_227600
*PAR0:	and then he was like . 227600_228420
*PAR0:	cat . 228420_228780
*PAR0:	yeah . 229060_229340
*PAR0:	so I think and [/] and when we were doing like the pointing like he seemed to know more than he was saying . 229340_233620
*PAR0:	so it's like he probably just you know he &-um just is learning some more words for those . 233680_239400
*PAR0:	yeah . 239560_239800
*PAR0:	what about &-um can you play with this a little bit . 239900_242720
*PAR0:	&-um dolls and stuff . 242720_244000
*PAR0:	yeah . 244140_244440
*PAR0:	he &-um he's into shoes . 244440_247120
*PAR0:	&-um you know he likes playing with shoes . 247580_249240
*PAR0:	so he saw those . 249300_250100
*PAR0:	and that kind of &-um drew his attention . 250100_253000
*PAR0:	he likes to line things up and or stack things . 253200_256480
*PAR0:	like [/] like I said he loves to play with his cars . 256540_258260
*PAR0:	and his father . 258440_259560
*PAR0:	we have matchbox cars from when his father was little . 259560_262280
*PAR0:	so like a ton of matchbox cars . 262460_264220
*PAR0:	so he likes to line them up either side by side or front to back and then . 264300_268100
*PAR0:	he likes to up too . 268100_269720
*PAR0:	so &-um when he saw the multiple pairs of shoes it was like . 269720_273720
*PAR0:	okay I know these are all shoes . 273720_275220
*PAR0:	so I'm gonna line them all up you know . 275220_276820
*PAR0:	and we've been working with him on numbers . 277500_279320
*PAR0:	so he knows like whenever he lines something up we'll generally come over and be like . 279320_282620
*PAR0:	oh wow . 282620_283100
*PAR0:	you lined it up . 283100_283780
*PAR0:	let's count them . 283780_284500
*PAR0:	you know . 284500_284800
*PAR0:	so that's I think probably what that was all about . 285200_288480
*PAR0:	&-um I try to get him to like babies a little more . 288480_291860
*PAR0:	you know it's like he it's the gender thing really plays into it a lot . 291860_298140
*PAR0:	&-um as much as I try like babies flowers it's like I want a cars and trucks mom &-um or animals . 298380_304360
*PAR0:	although he just like &-um play food in the kitchen . 305080_307180
*PAR0:	and when we go to like &-um a play area he likes to push the grocery cart or whatever . 307180_313400
*PAR0:	oh boy you love it here . 313700_316120
*PAR0:	did you get more fish . 316300_317420
*PAR0:	yeah . 317660_317860
*PAR0:	oh you wanna go sit with Devon over there and have some . 318060_320660
*PAR0:	yeah . 320760_320840
*PAR0:	sit at the table . 321920_322740
*PAR0:	does he have any dolls up here at the butler . 323440_325320
*PAR0:	yeah well he has &-um more stuffed animals &-um than official dolls . 325320_330480
*PAR0:	&-um just that we don't buy him a lot of toys . 330480_333640
*PAR0:	so most of it is gifts . 333640_335020
*PAR0:	&-um and we've gotten a lot of stuffed animal gifts . 335020_337340
*PAR0:	&-um I'm trying to think I he has he doesn't have any dolls like those like with plastic heads . 337720_345300
*PAR0:	he has mostly like [/] like Elmo's stuffed poo you know that kind of thing . 345300_350400
*PAR0:	&-um and when he plays with those at home it's typically like a minute each . 350400_357960
*PAR0:	and he'll hug it or rock it and then drop it and move to the next thing you know . 357960_362020
*PAR0:	&-um we try like sometimes I'll like put a diaper on the poo doll or something . 363220_369560
*PAR0:	he thinks that's hilarious . 369760_370680
*PAR0:	but then he's off to the next thing you know . 371120_372880
*PAR0:	so it doesn't they don't seem to hold his attention as long as trucks and cars . 373100_379180
*PAR0:	yeah . 379480_379720
*PAR0:	and does he have any play food at all . 379980_382240
*PAR0:	are you s are you said he's like playing with these ones . 382340_384680
*PAR0:	but &-um he doesn't we don't have play food at home . 384680_387300
*PAR0:	&-um but he they have it at a &-um play center that we go to a lot . 387300_392600
*PAR0:	so he does like they have a shopping cart . 392880_395180
*PAR0:	and he likes to put the food in the shopping cart and pretend to eat it or actually mouth it . 395240_399960
*PAR0:	you know because he's still teething a little bit . 399960_401760
*PAR0:	&-um so I'm glad I like to play with the play food because he &-um had some food sensitivities when he was younger . 401760_410660
*PAR0:	so he hasn't had like as many foods probably as a normal two year old &-um in a variety because we were so slow to introduce different things . 410660_419640
*PAR0:	so whenever we see like play food [/] food that's like you know hot dog he hasn't had a hot dog . 419960_424340
*PAR0:	he's very skeptical [/] skeptical [/] skeptical . 424340_427660
*PAR0:	yes skeptical sometimes doesn't sound right in my head &-um of new foods . 427660_433740
*PAR0:	so like a hot dog you know most toddlers are probably like hot dog . 433740_437320
*PAR0:	he's like suspicious of it . 437320_439040
*PAR0:	so &-um whenever we see food that he hasn't had in [/] in a place you know toy food format I'm like . 439040_446660
*PAR0:	ooh look at this you know were there . 446660_448940
*PAR0:	some today that you that he's never seen . 448940_450520
*PAR0:	yeah Kiwi probably . 450520_451960
*PAR0:	I'm sure he hasn't had &-um Kiwi probably . 451960_457300
*PAR0:	and a pork chop . 457300_458880
*PAR0:	I don't think he's seen a pork chop like on a bone like that before . 458980_461940
*PAR0:	&-um and a hot pepper for sure . 461940_467480
*PAR0:	yeah . 467480_468760
*PAR0:	does he ever try to help you like in the kitchen . 468760_471460
*PAR0:	oh yeah we yeah I have &-um a step stool . 471460_474680
*PAR0:	and he comes up with a step stool . 474680_475880
*PAR0:	and we make &-um pancakes and &-um a smoothie juice in the blender . 475880_481400
*PAR0:	he gets to push the buttons on the blender . 481600_483180
*PAR0:	and yeah he likes to help in the kitchen . 483460_485420
*PAR0:	so yeah he seemed like when you said something about the stove like he knew what it was . 485820_490460
*PAR0:	oh yeah we well that's yeah because it's hot . 490560_493040
*PAR0:	so we try to keep him <you know> [/] you know not touching the stove . 493120_496940
*PAR0:	so that's why I was like . 497100_497860
*PAR0:	you can touch this one . 497860_499300
*PAR0:	but we don't touch it at home because it's hot . 499300_500900
*PAR0:	mm hm yeah . 501020_502300
*PAR0:	he seemed to I think he seemed more into the food than anything else . 502920_505880
*PAR0:	yeah well I think he was excited at first about the &-um the toy animals . 506120_511300
*PAR0:	but then it was like . 511820_512760
*PAR0:	oh wait there's everything else . 512760_514060
*PAR0:	yeah in the other earlier play sessions <was he> [/] was he more with the food too or &-um yeah I think so . 514220_521440
*PAR0:	yeah <I remember> [/] I remember him not really being interested in &-um the stuffed animals because I remember there was like a bee &-um and some other things . 521440_532800
*PAR0:	but it was yeah I was oh okay . 532800_535880
