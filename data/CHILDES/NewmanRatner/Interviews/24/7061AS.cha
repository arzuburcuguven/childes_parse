*PAR0:	hi . 15000_16460
*PAR0:	so I'm just going to ask you some questions . 16460_20800
*PAR0:	okay . 20800_21200
*PAR0:	okay . 21200_21680
*PAR0:	about what you played with . 21680_23020
*PAR0:	&-um can you tell me what you played with today . 23020_24980
*PAR0:	&-uh well she went right to the magnets . 24980_26780
*PAR0:	okay . 27220_27540
*PAR0:	and then sort of lost interest pretty quickly when she saw the food . 27620_30400
*PAR0:	okay . 30780_31040
*PAR0:	&-um and then the baby dolls got dragged into the food . 31300_36020
*PAR0:	play . 36020_36300
*PAR0:	and that's pretty much it . 36980_38480
*PAR0:	did she have any similar toys at home . 38520_40820
*PAR0:	she just got a kitchen and food for her birthday . 40860_43580
*PAR0:	and that was a week ago . 43580_44360
*PAR0:	so this is all sort of new for her . 44360_47860
*PAR0:	that's a baby's pom [/] pom . 47860_49900
*PAR0:	yay . 49900_51140
*PAR0:	when we go to E's game we say <go e go> [/] e go e .
*PAR0:	so she has like a similar like a stove .
*PAR0:	she yeah it's a kitchen has the [/] the stove and the refrigerator and stuff like that . 51140_62840
*PAR0:	she's had some food pieces . 62980_65300
*PAR0:	but she really had nothing to play with them in . 65300_67780
*PAR0:	now she's got the [/] the full set . 67820_69540
*PAR0:	and when we've come here before she's always gone right for the food too . 70420_74240
*PAR0:	&-um and <she's got> [/] she's got like one or two baby dolls at home that she [/] she will play with kind of like this . 75000_83120
*PAR0:	like she'll play with it with the food and incorporate it into her play . 83120_86280
*PAR0:	but she doesn't really play with it by itself . 86280_88200
*PAR0:	it's always gotta be involved in something else . 88320_91180
*PAR0:	the dolls or the food the dolls . 91380_92920
*PAR0:	okay . 93200_93500
*PAR0:	so she [/] she won't sit there and just play with the baby doll . 93560_96120
*PAR0:	she'll bring the [/] the baby [/] baby doll [/] doll over [/] over to [/] to eat [/] eat the [/] the food [/] food or [/] or she'll [/] she'll bring [/] bring the baby . 96220_99620
*PAR0:	doll over to paint or but it's never just the doll by itself . 99620_102700
*PAR0:	so does she do anything else with the dolls . 102880_106820
*PAR0:	like does she like she feeds them with food . 106960_108900
*PAR0:	she'll feed it and burp it and rock it . 109040_111420
*PAR0:	and that's kind of it . 111700_113940
*PAR0:	&-um and then with the food does she like actually pretend to cook or does she kinda just she pretends to cook . 114980_120060
*PAR0:	and she pretends ta eat . 120320_121720
*PAR0:	she m would rather watch other people eat . 122440_124620
*PAR0:	so she'd rather have me pretend ta eat or the dog . 124700_127080
*PAR0:	she'll stick it in the dog's face and pretend ta eat or my husband's face . 127280_129900
*PAR0:	&-um and she'll eat pretend eat if we're pretend eating . 130420_132600
*PAR0:	&-um but mostly she likes ta just pretend cook . 133080_135680
*PAR0:	does she ever try to help you in the kitchen like mixing things . 136400_139380
*PAR0:	or she has mixed &-uh like cake batter and stuff like that before . 139380_144140
*PAR0:	&-um but that's kind of it . 145060_147420
*PAR0:	and she knows like the stove is hot and like spinach . 149280_152060
*PAR0:	she does know the stove is hot because we say it a [/] a lot because I'm paranoid about it . 152080_157340
*PAR0:	so she knows that the stovishat and the food that comes from the Stovishet and do you think she recognized any of these foods or does she eat &-um foods like this at home . 157340_166420
*PAR0:	&-um well she recognizes the cheese because that's her favorite . 166420_170220
*PAR0:	&-um I think she recognizes I mean we had green beans last night . 170220_174420
*PAR0:	but I don't know that she recognizes the name to say what it is . 174420_179940
*PAR0:	but I mean I [/] I think she knows what certain things are . 179940_185400
*PAR0:	because with the at home at least she uses her pizza . 185400_188560
*PAR0:	cutter on her pizza specifically . 188560_190380
*PAR0:	&-um and she'll put all of her fruits together and in like a big bowl . 190380_197480
*PAR0:	so I [/] I m I don't know if I'm giving her too much credit . 197760_201380
*PAR0:	but I think she recognizes the toy food with the real food . 201480_204040
*PAR0:	probably well . 204740_206840
*PAR0:	and some of these are pretty lifelike you know so that's true . 206840_209360
*PAR0:	like the cheese is pretty good . 209660_211100
*PAR0:	and she seemed to know like the [/] the [/] the sweet things you know . 211180_215320
*PAR0:	mm hm ↫d↫does she try to help you bake and stuff . 215420_217860
*PAR0:	or <she likes> [/] she likes eating and stuff . 217860_220580
*PAR0:	well she doesn't get cupcakes very often . 220900_223340
*PAR0:	but I make them a lot . 223660_224700
*PAR0:	and she will help me mix . 224700_226740
*PAR0:	and she'll watch me pour . 226740_227940
*PAR0:	and &-um she likes to watch me pipe icing . 228160_232320
*PAR0:	and she'll sort of like pretend she's doing it too . 232760_234800
*PAR0:	but that's kind of it because she'll sit there and she'll [/] she'll motion with me . 235060_241600
*PAR0:	and then with does she have any animals at home or she does they're not as lifelike as this . 243040_249540
*PAR0:	they're much more cartoonish . 249660_251340
*PAR0:	&-um but they're I mean they're plastic figurines . 251340_254620
*PAR0:	but they like it's a it's like a cartoonish looking zebra . 254620_261140
*PAR0:	it's not really like as lifelike . 261140_264200
*PAR0:	&-um and she plays with those a lot . 264200_265680
*PAR0:	but I think because I [/] I think because these are so realistic they don't she doesn't quite know what to do with them . 265680_275260
*PAR0:	yeah . 275540_277380
*PAR0:	and these are all . 277900_278540
*PAR0:	well but you said she kinda was drawn to these at first right . 278740_281800
*PAR0:	she went right for the magnets . 281860_282800
*PAR0:	she's got letter magnets and animal magnets at home that she plays with . 282880_287120
*PAR0:	&-um and they're all sort of the same . 287740_289700
*PAR0:	they're like they're drawings . 289700_291800
*PAR0:	they're not a picture of an animal . 291800_293620
*PAR0:	so I don't know if she just associated it or saw animals and went for the animals because she definitely went for those animals over these guys . 293620_303040
*PAR0:	yeah these are a little friendlier looking I guess exactly some of these are a little scary like some of the insects . 303040_309260
*PAR0:	ooh . 309300_309740
*PAR0:	are you gonna stir it now too . 309740_311220
*PAR0:	has she ever been to like a zoo . 311220_312760
*PAR0:	she has &-um two weeks ago we were in Buffalo and she went to the Buffalo Zoo &-uh she went to the National Zoo last year . 313080_319120
*PAR0:	but she was only she's just turned one . 319540_321540
*PAR0:	so I don't think she so do you think she might have recognized some of these like from zoo or like a you said something about a kinder farm . 321540_329240
*PAR0:	oh we go to a kinder farm in Severna Park a lot . 329240_332040
*PAR0:	and they have sheep and cows . 332040_333680
*PAR0:	so she sees the sheep and cows about once a week there . 333680_336900
*PAR0:	so she's probably familiar with some of these . 336900_342180
*PAR0:	then . 342180_342620
*PAR0:	yeah she's familiar with the farm animals because except for horses they don't have horses but they have goats and sheep and pigs and chickens and cows . 342620_350720
*PAR0:	and but she mostly just she sees the cow . 350720_353740
*PAR0:	she sees the sheep . 353740_354420
*PAR0:	and she's good . 354420_355080
*PAR0:	that's all she really needs . 356360_357200
*PAR0:	oh yeah she liked it in the book . 357720_359020
*PAR0:	&-um earlier she was pointing to them . 359020_361420
*PAR0:	mhm . 361560_361600
*PAR0:	liked them . 361740_362160
*PAR0:	mhm . 362360_362480
*PAR0:	does she like to read with you at home a lot . 363720_365980
*PAR0:	she does she's very big on it . 365980_367880
*PAR0:	and recently we'll read to her . 367880_370720
*PAR0:	and then she'll read back to . 370720_373020
*PAR0:	us . 373020_373760
*PAR0:	and but I [/] I think just because there's other people here . 373760_376380
*PAR0:	she's not going to do it . 376380_377320
*PAR0:	&-um she's normally quite the chatter box or she'll sit there . 378140_380860
*PAR0:	and she'll read to herself if I'm doing something else . 380860_385300
*PAR0:	but she reads her cadence is very she mimics us . 385300_393540
*PAR0:	so if we go high on a certain page she is high on that page . 393540_397280
*PAR0:	and or if my husband makes like a grumbly noise she'll try and make the grumbly noise . 397280_401880
*PAR0:	so she's just trying to repeat kind of what we say . 401880_404680
*PAR0:	right . 405780_406620
*PAR0:	it seemed like she started to kind of read it back . 407580_410800
*PAR0:	but then she was shy . 410800_411860
*PAR0:	and you know I think it's when there's other people even people that she knows she if it's not me or her daddy it's she's not open and does she have any siblings . 411860_427680
*PAR0:	nope . 428040_428460
*PAR0:	it's just her &-uh we babysit . 428700_430440
*PAR0:	so she hangs out with two boys two older boys Monday through Friday but it's just for a couple hours each day . 430820_438080
*PAR0:	are they like much older than her . 438860_440640
*PAR0:	they're four and nine . 440660_441520
*PAR0:	so they're there's a significant gap . 441860_444600
*PAR0:	does she try to play with them at all . 444860_446340
*PAR0:	she tries to play with the four year old a lot . 446380_447840
*PAR0:	&-um she's never really tried to play directly with him . 448280_455640
*PAR0:	she always plays like alongside him . 455760_457500
*PAR0:	but with the nine year old she'll actually try to play with him . 457800_460920
*PAR0:	she'll play catch with him or she'll color with him . 460920_463160
*PAR0:	so I don't know what you know how she views the two of them . 463160_467840
*PAR0:	but the older one she will interact with during her play . 467840_472600
*PAR0:	and the four year old she just . 472600_474160
*PAR0:	kind of likes to tag along and do her own thing next to him . 474160_476440
*PAR0:	well does [/] does he [/] he try to like interact with her because maybe that's part of it . 476740_481540
*PAR0:	he gets very frustrated with her . 481580_482880
*PAR0:	he doesn't want her to touch his things . 483100_484460
*PAR0:	or she's doing it wrong or she's not doing . 484460_486680
*PAR0:	so it's probably better that they just sit next to each other . 486680_490820
*PAR0:	he probably senses it . 491140_492020
*PAR0:	he doesn't really want her to touch his stuff . 492480_494200
*PAR0:	so I'll just play next to you . 494200_495360
*PAR0:	but when they're doing you know active things . 495940_501020
*PAR0:	if they're playing soccer in the front yard she'll run with them . 501020_505580
*PAR0:	so if they're running down the field she'll be running down the field . 505980_508360
*PAR0:	and she doesn't really try to get into the game . 508360_511700
*PAR0:	she's just kind of mimicking what they're doing . 511760_513460
*PAR0:	and she has a good time doing it . 513580_515600
*PAR0:	so it's yeah sort of a win-win that she's not interrupting their game but she's still involved . 515820_520780
*PAR0:	yeah she feels like she's a part of it . 520780_522980
*PAR0:	but does she like to play outside more you think or does she kind of do both like some . 522980_528200
*PAR0:	she's happy either wear his hat . 528200_531920
*PAR0:	oh I don't know . 531920_533240
*PAR0:	oh there's his hat . 533240_535900
*PAR0:	when we're inside she's has her books . 537180_540120
*PAR0:	and she has her kitchen . 540120_540900
*PAR0:	and she has her painting . 540900_542000
*PAR0:	but when we're outside we have the slide . 542460_543940
*PAR0:	and we have the balls . 543940_545380
*PAR0:	and we have the bubbles . 545380_546380
*PAR0:	and so it's just I think she'd rather be doing bubbles twenty four hours a day . 546620_551640
*PAR0:	but she's very happy with the inside activities and the outside activities . 552000_556300
*PAR0:	I thought the bubbles would get her . 557000_559000
*PAR0:	but I don't know just she . 559000_560620
*PAR0:	just doesn't wanna talk in front of anybody . 560620_562160
*PAR0:	mhm . 562940_563220
*PAR0:	mommy . 563220_563620
*PAR0:	yes . 564120_564620
*PAR0:	and she's really is a chatter box at home . 564960_567960
*PAR0:	I mean she does not stop talking at home . 568020_569820
*PAR0:	but then you get her outside . 570200_571520
*PAR0:	and she [/] she just clams up . 571520_574520
*PAR0:	yeah . 575720_575940
*PAR0:	she seems like with you she's [/] she's more chatty . 575940_578180
*PAR0:	but I think she just what's up . 578180_579440
*PAR0:	yes . 580260_580800
*PAR0:	this is a microphone . 581280_582160
*PAR0:	does she likes to paint at home . 584140_585960
*PAR0:	mhm . 586180_586420
*PAR0:	she has watercolors that she paints with cool . 586800_590760
*PAR0:	yeah she liked the coloring a lot . 591480_592940
*PAR0:	is there anything else that was different from like other sessions like past ones . 594060_601140
*PAR0:	&-um I think it took her a little longer to open up this time . 601220_604420
*PAR0:	I feel like at other sessions there was one we did in another department . 604660_608240
*PAR0:	but they were opening boxes and things were inside . 608980_611880
*PAR0:	it took her two or three examples before . 612200_615480
*PAR0:	she just jumped right in and did it . 615480_616780
*PAR0:	and I feel like she was very reserved this time . 616880_620340
*PAR0:	it [/] it just seemed like it by now she should have been open . 620840_624340
*PAR0:	and she wasn't and I don't know if that's a gender thing . 624480_628560
*PAR0:	like I don't know if she's &-uh because she seemed a lot more open with you the in the later stuff . 628700_633740
*PAR0:	and with Sean in the earlier stuff . 633740_636820
*PAR0:	I don't know because he's a man . 636820_639600
*PAR0:	I said <I was> [/] I was wondering if that was part of it . 639600_641800
*PAR0:	but I mean usually the beginning everyone's shy . 641800_647200
*PAR0:	you know . 647200_647840
*PAR0:	so it just kind of takes a while . 647840_649620
*PAR0:	&-um did [/] did her playing seem different this time compared to other visits . 649620_654360
*PAR0:	not really and all the other visits . 654360_656140
*PAR0:	it's . 656140_656420
*PAR0:	sort of the same thing . 656420_657160
*PAR0:	like she looks around . 657160_657920
*PAR0:	but then she ends up with the food like that's just kind of her thing and which is fun maybe was she more like independent do you think in this session or more open helping you or whatever . 657920_671420
*PAR0:	&-um there was one where she had just learned to ask a question . 671420_676260
*PAR0:	and so everything was she would just pick what's this . 676260_678640
*PAR0:	what's this . 678640_679320
*PAR0:	what this . 679320_679880
*PAR0:	what's this . 679880_680540
*PAR0:	this [/] this is a spoon . 680600_683040
*PAR0:	but this time she was doing her own thing and cooking her own dinner [/] dinner . 683360_687120
*PAR0:	and so [/] so she what didn't need my help as much . 687120_690620
*PAR0:	what's this . 690620_692140
*PAR0:	cup . 692140_692560
*PAR0:	that's a cup . 692860_693560
*PAR0:	you didn't need to ask . 693580_694680
*PAR0:	no baby's cup . 695040_696840
*PAR0:	baby's cup . 696940_697580
*PAR0:	mm . 698100_700500
*PAR0:	well the only the last thing we have is &-um it's just like having her name pictures . 700920_707120
*PAR0:	I don know if she'll do it we could try it . 707200_708820
