dear eric carle
your story was very interesting a lot of kids like your story
well were not gonna make you read it this time but we thought -uh
a sigh of relief
-um but what we are having all the kids do is write a letter to eric carle who is the author of the book
and were gonna send him the letters
-uh and he lives in massachusetts
so -um were wondering if you could try to a write a quick letter to him
dont have to take that long like ten minutes
-um so heres some paper that we made
and heres a pencil
and we brought the book if you needta you know refresh your memory on how the story goes
some kids just know it
you know they have it memorized
its right here
so did you get a lot of snow
just a little
im sick of this stuff
its only january fifteenth
i know it
thats the feeling like oh my god
getting sick of the stuff
dear eric carle
the comma goes after his name
ac tell him if you like the story
tell him if
did you guys have a reason for choosing this book
they chose it a long time ago
i think they liked it because -um
well i dont necessarily know
i mean i think its a nice story and theres lotta a lot of things little things you can talk about with it
-um its fun you know with the little pages and stuff so
chi we can take ten years to do this or we can get it over with
so lets go
come on now
well i got it right here then
and right here
im gonna write this letter for you arent i

its a lot of time involved in it so
yeah its nice
its pretty
how did you get up there on a ladder
yeah i have a ladder up there so
hm its really simple to do but its just time consuming
we may do airplanes in chis room right
do you do that a lot in school
-um well we actually only give people two pages in the event that they have tons to write but you dont have to fill the two pages
well theres something you should add
how that i hope
it might be a good idea

you dont write a comma after dear you write a comma after
what would you write
thats good
okay everything is in capitals
the first letters because the title of a book

question mark

thats great
good idea chi
oh neat
oh thanks
those video cameras are getting smaller and smaller
how come its sticking
well which one do you think is the magnet
but it sticks to that
oh you were trying to like get some magnetic force from that and then take it to
does it work to do that
i think youre going to have trouble getting these toys away from him
oh wait
did that really work
oh my gosh ive never seen that
you rub that
some of the magnet stuffs coming off
see if you can do it with the paper clip too
first time
you gotta rub it and then do it right away
there you go
oh my gosh

thats really cool
i didnt think magnets could -um i dont know give their force to something else
like the electricity almost left over huh
chi you taught me something today
thank you very much
i like these little dudes
its working under the table under wood
that must be a pretty strong magnet
i know
better hide all of my gold jewelry
you know the simplest toys like this that parents never even think twice
i know no no rules involved no
right exactly just all imagination
and it is hard to loose the parts cause they stick to each other
well have to go to the learning center
comes off
is that the magnet on top or is
chi do these guys up here
lets see
are they working
chi you know what we should do
have one of your friends come over right
and well make believe we are having a seance
we have someone with a magnet under the table
thats true i never thought
thats probably how they do it
yeah i know
now move this magnet with the monster on it
oh okay
hm let me let me see
it for a second
maybe the monsters too heavy
i hadnt thought of it that way
that noise scared me
reminds me of last year
i took him and his brother to see a christmas carol at the charles play house
and the two of them
they jumped up so high they were almost in tears
i was cracked up laughing
because you just werent expecting it
yeah -um try that again
but probably
but a lot louder huh
yeah and plus you werent expecting it
thats the other thing is
they must have jumped up a mile out of there seats
you know i think i saw that now that i think about it
it was great
really good
i thought it was something light for kids their age you know that wouldnt turn them off to plays
it was very scary
its the the that comes
yeah i think it was the fir
im not sure it
yeah i think it was
the one in the green robe that was very jolly and changed all the words around
youre going to have to because she hasta use all these toys for all of the other kids that are in the study too
it would be great if we could give you all of these but
it was a great choice

and this is hayden
eight zero eight
and then -um my friend
his name is jibo
i think will introduce himself
so go ahead and hit

my name is jibo
whats your name
see what he has to say
thats an awesome name
my favorite color is blue
whats your favorite color
thats so cool
lets get started
you heard jibo

and well do that after every game that we play
so for our first task
i know you know your alphabet
so why dont you just tell me the letter you see
what you see the picture of
and another word that starts with that letter
and well go through the alphabet
i know
it can be kind of tough
i know im putting you on the spot
so we can brainstorm together
if you say you want something plus something else its and maybe
is that a good a word
or can you think of another one
good word
youre doing good thinking
i know it can be tough to think of all of these on the spot
i did not see that word coming
makes sense
giraffe is a good g word
there you go
there you go
thats a good word and a good attribute
i didnt think of that one
its right there too
lets see
you do what to a book
or what to a door
there you go
thats what hes doing there
i dont know
i dont know if theres any other q words
lets see
you -um
oh if you stop
thats better than the word i was thinking of

that fits
what are you using to talk right now
this ones gonna be a tough one huh
oh yeah
i like that
great job
oh jibo liked that one too
thats awesome
go ahead and hit a buzzer
and well go to the next one
so were gonna read numbers
and ill let you know when the pattern might change
well see if we can guess what the pattern is
so for now just tell me the number you see
if the pattern changes what do you think its going to change to
what number you think might come next
then what do you think might come next
if we keep this
what is it here
any ideas
and then
you wouldve gotten it
and now we switched it up again
whats this number
and then
were gonna skip ahead again
moving right on
whats that one
ill give you a hint
there you go
now what do you think well go up by now
oh that would be a good number
i switched it up again
whats this number
now tell me what this is on there

next thing
ill have you look at me
and were gonna go through these flashcards okay
so if i say that this is a bag
and now theres two of them
there are two
youre exactly right
it would be next
but were only gonna go
do one and two
so if we have two of them there are two
go ahead and say it again
just like that
easier than you think
so if we have one dup
this is
youre exactly right but were gonna call it a ship
this were gonna call a smide
this is gonna go be a skack

that makes a lot of sense
well then where are they going now
whats on the other side
yeah thats a good
is there anything else you can think to say about this picture
or see in this picture
it does need color
that would make it all show up a lot better
youre right

oh my gosh yeah
that window is open
why would he do that
what does it look like hes doing
how is it dirty
thats true
what else do you see in the picture
thats why you said he wanted to jump out
oh yeah
so do you think this is real or do you think this is imaginary
is he pretending
that makes sense cause who has clouds in your in your room in a real home
is he wearing anything silly or is he
is that how you would normally look when youre playing pretend
what whats silly about it

some kind of vegetable
ah i cant even see that
you really do have good eyes

you just knew that from reading
or on your own
thats really smart hayden

whats that say
thats right

so division is the opposite of multiplication so you have to think what goes into twenty one three times
and the answer is seven
what do you mean going back
because when you divide
whats that
what this is saying
twenty one divided by seven
is what number goes into twenty one three times
so the number has to be smaller than twenty one

one seven equals seven
two sevens equals fourteen
and three sevens equals twenty one
