@Date:	01-FEB-1996
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	play with that [= magnets] for like (.) about ten minutes .
@Comment:	Time is 24:44
@Comment:	MOT and Chi play seperately the entire time; there is almost no talk at all. What little there is does not relate to the present activity , but rather to other household members. There is no discussion of the magnetic qualities of the objects , and there is little experimentation. The only semblance of experimentation is when Chi notices that a ball stuck the the side of the black base can be made to roll up the side of the base just by placing the yellow wand near the ball , through repulsion.
*INV:	+^ I'll stop you after [//] in a while .
%sit:	MOT and Chi sit at a table; they have just been given the magnets which are all stuck to the black base; Mot and Chi begin by removing the magnets from the base
*MOT:	do I get to play or just her ?
*INV:	oh yeah .
*INV:	+^ both of you .
*INV:	that's something you guys can do together .
*INV:	oh yeah .
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	want me to move this [= referent unclear] ?
*CHI:	(..) I wish I could do this to Troy [= Chi's brother] one day .
%sit:	during the pause , MOT and Chi play separately with the pieces which are now spread out across the table
%act:	holds up the yellow wand; two balls and one silver man dangle in a line from the wand
*MOT:	+^ now (.) why would you wanna do that [= hang him in the air like the silver man hangs from the yellow wand] to my son ?
*CHI:	www .
*MOT:	www [>] .
%sit:	Chi and Mot discuss how Chi's brother hits Chi and Mot too hard when he plays with them because he's stronger than them
*CHI:	0 [<] .
%act:	builds a mini-pyramid; on top of the yellow wand , she places two balls and on top of them , stands a silver man
%com:	Chi builds this pyramid while she talks with Mot
*CHI:	no .
%sit:	Chi thinks Mot has taken a piece which Chi did not want Mot to take
*MOT:	no what ?
*CHI:	oh you can take that [= referent unclear] .
%com:	the referent cannot be seen because it is blocked by Mot's hands; it is a piece Mot picks up with the horseshoe magnet and it was next to the yellow wand
*MOT:	oh here's another one [= silver man] on the turtle .
*MOT:	+^ you want the one [= silver man] on the turtle ?
%act:	pushes the turtle with the silver man stuck to it toward Chi
*CHI:	no .
*MOT:	he's [= silver man on the turtle] goin(g) for a ride .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	lines up the blue bear on top of the blue arrow next to the turtle carrying the silver man
*MOT:	(.) xxx [=? my turn] in the middle ?
%com:	MOT may be asking if it's her turn to use the black base
*CHI:	no .
*MOT:	hey watch out !
*MOT:	+^ there's a storm comin(g) !
%act:	holds the horseshoe magnet with a blue paper clip attached to it
%int:	higher pitched; either the voice of the silver men on the black base , or of the blue bear and silver man which Mot lined up on the blue arrow and turtle respectively
%sit:	on the black base , Chi has arranged several standing silver men around a silver stick which stands in the middle of the base
*MOT:	xxx this [= white ball] .
%act:	touches white ball which is on the yellow wand
*MOT:	oh it's [= white ball] xxx .
%sit:	MOT removes finger from the white ball; Chi moves the yellow wand , with the red , orange , and white balls on top , next to the black base
*MOT:	okay .
*MOT:	(..) xxx .
%sit:	during the pause , MOT attaches objects to the horseshoe magnet and Chi continues playing with the silver men and silver stick on the black base; early in the pause , Chi pulled the yellow wand away from the black base and the red ball remained attached to the base; when she moved the wand back toward the red ball and the black base , the ball was repelled by the tip of the wand and rolled upward on the base until the wand could slide under it; Chi repeats this demonstration about five times
*MOT:	(..) xxx hold up .
%sit:	a ball dropped from the horseshoe magnet , MOT removes other pieces from the horseshoe magnet as well
*MOT:	(..) need this one [= silver stick] ?
*CHI:	no .
*MOT:	(..) the flying turtle .

%sit:	Chi holds the yellow wand , MOT put a few nuts on it , Chi removed the nuts from the yellow wand and when Mot goes to put other object on the wand , Chi pulls the wand away
*MOT:	(..) oh look at Wanda .
%sit:	on the yellow wand , Chi has lined up the horseshoe magnet , the blue arrow , and the blue bear; Chi shows has called Mot's attention to the set-up on the wand; the tier above shows Mot's response
%com:	<Wanda> may refer to the blue bear
*MOT:	(.) okay this [= silver stick] is gonna stay up here [= on top of a stack of nuts , a washer , and a silver ball] this time .
%com:	this is the second time Mot has attempted to put the silver stick on the stack of objects; the first time the stick fell off
%int:	mumbled
*CHI:	these things [= silver sticks] are so skinny .
%act:	holds a silver stick and tries to make it stand on the yellow wand
*MOT:	look xxx .

%sit:	the silver stick , which Chi has been trying to stand up on the black base , fell
*MOT:	Chi [=? so] ?
*MOT:	(..) alright here's the launching pad for the station .
%sit:	two nuts are stacked on top of each other and a silver ball is on top of them; the square checker-board magnet rests against them from behind; the turtle with the silver man stradling its shoulders appears to be watching this set up
