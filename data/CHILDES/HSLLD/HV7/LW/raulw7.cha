@Comment:	At first Mot thinks she's the one who is supposed to write the letter. She provides Chi with all of the content. Mot asks Chi what he liked most about the book , but Chi doesn't have much to say on the subject. Mot begins to read the story , and Chi writes about the part Mot likes. Later Mot asks Chi to continue reading the story where she left off. She corrects him when he makes a mistake in his reading. After hearing the whole story she thinks of another sentence to add to the letter. Interestingly , when Chi reads the finished letter out loud , he corrects some of the mistakes in Mot's dictation.
