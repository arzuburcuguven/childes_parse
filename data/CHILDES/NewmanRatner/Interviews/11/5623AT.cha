*PAR0:	home . 244500_244720
*PAR0:	and he [/] he gets books and brings them to us to read to him . 244840_248360
*PAR0:	he just didn't show any interest . 249100_251660
*PAR0:	yeah . 252000_252600
*PAR0:	he just he &-um is just being shy think he's staying on my lap which normally he wouldn't do unless he's tired or it's are you biting the baby . 253260_265920
*PAR0:	&-um so would you say he likes &-um books or toys more in general . 266560_275180

*PAR0:	and he brings them over constantly . 296780_298520
*PAR0:	&-um but a lot of his toys I think he's more interested in playing with other things like adult things like in the kitchen and taking the bulbs off the Christmas tree and that kind of stuff . 300080_315380
