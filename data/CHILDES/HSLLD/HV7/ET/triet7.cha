@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	18-JUL-1995
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnets Activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	here are some objects that we asked you to play with four years ago .
@Comment:	Time is 14:52. Video tape does not start until later; transcript until then is solely from audio
@Comment:	For the most part Mot and Chi play separately although they are right next to one another. They each work on their own constructions which they then show to the other. There is some talk about which objects are magnetized but little talk about why or how objects stick to one another.
