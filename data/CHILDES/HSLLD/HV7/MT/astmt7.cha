@Comment:	Chi , MOT and Chi's four year old Bro are eating dinner. Chi and Bro seem to be sitting at a table in one room , where the tape recorder is , and Mot in another room. The television is on loudly in the background throughout the whole meal. Bro talks very loudly throughout the mealtime conversation- he is either right next to the tape recorder or he yells everything he says. For the most part , MOT is in the background , answering a few questions and adding a few comments here and there. In the beginning , Chi questions Bro about his day and school like a mom would question her child. During most of the meal , BRO and Chi discuss the story Winnie the Pooh and the honey tree , a video they might have just watched.
