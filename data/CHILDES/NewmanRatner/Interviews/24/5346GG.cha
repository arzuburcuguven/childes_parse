*PAR0:	yeah we don't have the ones that are rubber like this . 104140_106600
*PAR0:	these are probably ones she hasn't seen . 106660_108760

*PAR0:	&-um we were just &-um like I said at my parents house for a month in the poconos . 130820_134960
*PAR0:	they were fishing or in the lake . 135180_137260
*PAR0:	or they'd go out like to the fish hatchery . 137260_139720
*PAR0:	and they'd see wild turkeys and &-um deer and frogs and snakes . 139720_145180
*PAR0:	and they were you know exposed to all that . 145180_147020
*PAR0:	so they that's like a big part of their life . 147160_149760
*PAR0:	&-um and &-uh we do go to the zoo . 150280_154000
*PAR0:	it's [/] it's a little hard with a two year old and a three year old by myself to go to the zoo . 154520_158100
*PAR0:	&-um but they like that but m more like outdoors and nature center like Brookside gardens and stuff like that where they can be a little bit more hands on . 158620_165660
*PAR0:	I think at this age it's &-um they just do anything but better than lots of . 165660_170160
*PAR0:	yeah . 170200_170440
*PAR0:	so she's actually bound to like touch animals like this like everywhere . 170760_173720

*PAR0:	and &-um they didn't touch the snakes but they you know were very close to the snakes like one on one . 185300_191000
*PAR0:	&-um and fish . 191000_192660
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah [/] yeah a lot of these animals are kind of like more yeah exotic . 192660_198520
*PAR0:	so they wouldn't . 198860_199800
*PAR0:	&-um but she might know some of the names of anything . 199800_202060
*PAR0:	oh she definitely does . 202340_203400
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah I think at that point she was just like . 203580_207080
*PAR0:	yeah she was a little tired . 208040_209540
*PAR0:	yeah . 209600_209740
*PAR0:	and so she found so last year or two on the beach . 209740_212220
*PAR0:	we found [/] found an octopus . 212220_213140
*PAR0:	and so she talks . 213140_214080
*PAR0:	I was surprised . 214080_214640
*PAR0:	she's like . 214640_214980
*PAR0:	I don't know that usually to me means I'm tired when she doesn't want to tell me anymore . 214980_219260
*PAR0:	&-um because we found it was about the size of an octopus inside of their seashell . 219260_223160
*PAR0:	and she was fascinated by it . 223160_224680
*PAR0:	and she'll talk about it for hours . 224680_226120
*PAR0:	&-um and we also just had two groundhogs in our backyard . 226120_229200
*PAR0:	which I'm surprised . 229200_230360
*PAR0:	she didn't tell you today because she tells like everyone she meets this was I think she saw them in like June and like she'll meet a . 230360_235900
*PAR0:	stranger and be like I have groundhogs in my yard . 235900_237800
*PAR0:	&-um so [/] so she definitely knows what some of the things are . 238420_242520
*PAR0:	yeah . 242520_242800
*PAR0:	but it sounds like she has like a memory like you said with &-uh with your dog back in May and she's still yeah . 243060_248020
*PAR0:	and she remembers &-uh &-um the groundhogs stuff us because those kids are kinda like . 248120_252820
*PAR0:	okay . 252820_253060
*PAR0:	like it happened like a month ago . 253060_254560
*PAR0:	well we [/] we got home on &-um on Sunday and that was like the first thing she said . 254740_258900
*PAR0:	like . 258960_259060
*PAR0:	where are my groundhogs in the yard . 259060_260280
*PAR0:	and she couldn't find them . 260360_261820
*PAR0:	yeah . 262020_263080
*PAR0:	and you said you have like a stove set at home . 264060_266160
*PAR0:	we have like a pink a big pink kitchen a [/] a wooden one with a lot of wooden play food and felt play food . 266340_273440
*PAR0:	&-um and she'll do that for like an hour . 273440_275840
*PAR0:	she'll just make stuff . 276020_276940
*PAR0:	and she always makes soup . 277020_277980
*PAR0:	she loves soup for some reason . 278080_279600
*PAR0:	&-um so and she'll do that like independent play without me like guiding her through it . 280360_285920
*PAR0:	like I felt like today I was a little bit more I think because she was tired like trying to get her to do her soup thing . 285980_292960
*PAR0:	but &-um she'll just do that for a long time . 293280_295660
*PAR0:	and then come up and like feed everyone in the house . 295660_297540
*PAR0:	and yeah does she have dolls like that . 297640_299560
*PAR0:	did she try some feed as well . 299580_300800
*PAR0:	or she does she really likes baby dolls I think because we're having a baby too . 300800_305400
*PAR0:	she's also focused on that . 305540_306740
*PAR0:	although she's always liked baby dolls whereas my three year old has . 306740_309300
*PAR0:	never been that into them . 309300_310720
*PAR0:	&-um like she wants to sleep with like three or four baby dolls a night . 310720_315300
*PAR0:	she'll put them to bed . 315860_317480
*PAR0:	and she'll like cover them up and put them night [/] night . 317480_319980
*PAR0:	and rock them and sing to them . 319980_322600
*PAR0:	and although if you ask her are you the baby's mommy . 322740_325240
*PAR0:	she always says . 325240_325840
*PAR0:	no . 325840_326060
*PAR0:	which is funny . 326060_326980
*PAR0:	she doesn't wanna be mommy . 327280_328320
*PAR0:	yes . 329120_329480
*PAR0:	can hear me . 329680_330120

*PAR0:	does she try to help you like with little things in the kitchen too . 332660_334980
*PAR0:	like is that kinda I try ta get her to &-um which she will like if she because the way our kitchen is like there's an island . 335060_341720
*PAR0:	and she has ta sit up at a stool . 341720_343000
*PAR0:	so I'll have her like help me you know she wants her own pot . 343120_346420
*PAR0:	and then she'll put like the fruit baskets right there . 346520_348420
*PAR0:	so she'll put all the fruit in it and stir it with a spatula . 348460_350660
*PAR0:	&-um but <I don't have> [/] I don't have it set up like where she could actually help cook yet . 351400_355880
*PAR0:	yeah because she's so little you know . 355960_357280
*PAR0:	yeah . 357420_357540
*PAR0:	&-um but yeah she'll [/] she'll like mimic me . 357800_360940
*PAR0:	mm in that way it seemed like she recognized I said earlier she's tiny . 361300_372300
*PAR0:	and she'll just eat all day like she eats a goldfish . 372300_375140
*PAR0:	but she'd sit down and have like [/] like the other night she ate like two servings of meatloaf and peas and couscous you know . 375140_384180
*PAR0:	and she's totally happy with that too . 384180_386100
*PAR0:	&-um she loves like fish and seafood . 386660_389200
*PAR0:	this was another thing I was surprised . 389540_390680
*PAR0:	she didn't say because for her birthday party we . 390680_392320
*PAR0:	had a &-um just a little family dinner a Mermaid party . 392320_395520
*PAR0:	and we had lobsters . 395520_396540
*PAR0:	and she was eating them like . 396620_397660
*PAR0:	s did you ever see the movie . 397660_399200
*PAR0:	splash . 399200_399800
*PAR0:	are you too young for that . 399820_401060
*PAR0:	okay . 401060_401840
*PAR0:	well it's about a mermaid . 401840_402580
*PAR0:	and she &-um she like eats the whole lobster in the shell . 402580_406940
*PAR0:	and Grace was trying to like eat the lobster right out of the shell . 406940_409940
*PAR0:	so &-um she doesn't really have like any food inhibitions . 409940_413800
*PAR0:	she likes Sushi and all that kind of stuff . 413800_416520
*PAR0:	yeah . 416520_416540
*PAR0:	I was surprised when you said that I was like . 416540_417780
*PAR0:	oh because I figure a lot of little kids either they don't know what it is or they're're they don't like it . 417780_421280
*PAR0:	yeah no she's [/] she's a really good eater . 421280_423460
*PAR0:	&-um so &-uh although she will also eat goldfish all day if you <let her> [/] let her do that . 423460_430720
*PAR0:	but yeah . 430720_431220
*PAR0:	does she like to read with you . 431220_432580
*PAR0:	it seemed like she was reading with you . 432580_434040
*PAR0:	mhm . 434040_434120
*PAR0:	we do a lot of reading . 434520_435400
*PAR0:	we have I we have like a million books . 435400_437420
*PAR0:	I know there was a question about that . 437420_438740
*PAR0:	I [/] I think we probably have three or four hundred children's books . 438740_441440
*PAR0:	because we just have gotten so many as gifts . 441440_444580
*PAR0:	and &-um we buy a lot . 444580_447700
*PAR0:	and just we think that's really important in our house . 447700_451580
*PAR0:	still a lot of reading . 451580_452300
*PAR0:	and so &-um I mean bedtime is a time . 452300_454820
*PAR0:	we always do it like regularly . 454820_456240
*PAR0:	and each girl picks out about three or four books . 456240_459540
*PAR0:	and then we read with them . 459540_460920
*PAR0:	my husband . 460920_461340
*PAR0:	and I do &-um but they'll read throughout the day . 461340_464320
*PAR0:	&-um they'll sit there and read by themselves . 464320_466720
*PAR0:	they'll fight over . 466720_469040
*PAR0:	the books &-um we do go to the library too . 469240_472820
*PAR0:	and they get to pick out their own books there . 472820_474680
*PAR0:	and so I mean we have probably every play area in the house . 474920_479960
*PAR0:	like in our living room . 479960_480960
*PAR0:	we have a big trunk that has books . 480960_483740
*PAR0:	and then in their bedrooms they have a bookshelf . 483740_485900
*PAR0:	&-um because they share a room . 485900_487680
*PAR0:	and then upstairs in our playroom too . 488240_489560
*PAR0:	we have another big basket of books . 489560_491000
*PAR0:	and then there's a whole wall of bookshelves there . 491120_493080
*PAR0:	so yeah . 493240_493820
*PAR0:	so they can access books whenever they want to . 494040_496340
*PAR0:	I keep them in the car . 496380_497280
*PAR0:	and [/] and they try to read them themselves . 497280_499340
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah they will I didn't I [/] I didn't see her . 499740_502600
*PAR0:	go for that one at all . 502600_503540
*PAR0:	I think . 503540_503960
*PAR0:	yeah we have that one . 504200_505440
*PAR0:	I think we just didn't like get over there . 505560_507100
*PAR0:	&-um she likes that one . 507560_509840
*PAR0:	sh she that's one of the ones actually that she'll read because she knows it . 509840_512900
*PAR0:	she knows it well like she'll either read it by herself or she'll finish my sentences . 513360_517060
*PAR0:	yeah I think a lot of yeah a lot of kids that come here have familiar fans . 517680_521420
*PAR0:	and they'll kinda they know . 521420_523200
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah they know what's up . 523200_525980
*PAR0:	she's also started to put together . 526040_527620
*PAR0:	cause &-um Margaret Wise Brown wrote an another book called the Runaway Bunny do you know that book . 527620_533120
*PAR0:	I've seen it . 533380_534000
*PAR0:	so there's a picture in here that she started to recognize that &-um is on the wall . 534060_538960
*PAR0:	and she last week was like . 539120_541660
*PAR0:	what is it . 542540_543160
*PAR0:	so this is one of the pictures from the book the Runaway Bunny . 543480_546220
*PAR0:	and she was like . 546540_547540
*PAR0:	that's the runaway bunny . 547580_548600
*PAR0:	that's the mommy fishing . 548700_549700
*PAR0:	and that's the baby fish . 549900_551100
*PAR0:	&-um yeah so I mean I knew it was in there . 551660_554440
*PAR0:	but I hadn't really pointed it out to her before . 554440_556260
*PAR0:	and she connected that together . 556260_558160
*PAR0:	so yeah she seems really good about like putting things together . 558160_561080
*PAR0:	like when she said about the salt going in a corn I was so surprised that she said that because it's not like we had it . 561180_566360
*PAR0:	I don't think she's ever seen a bus . 566360_588920
*PAR0:	that's not like yellow or orange . 588920_590200
*PAR0:	so yeah so it was funny when she said that because I thought I was like . 590200_593840
*PAR0:	oh I know she knows what that is . 593840_595040
*PAR0:	but it's not the same color that she usually identifies it with . 595100_597940
*PAR0:	so &-um yeah a lot of kids that's what a lot of parents will be like . 598440_602220
*PAR0:	I know she knows it but it's just sometimes it looks a little different or just seeing a picture might know it in real life . 602420_608540
*PAR0:	but then it looks a little different . 608540_609800
*PAR0:	and so they [/] they don't associate you know they don't realize . 609880_612240
*PAR0:	so . 612240_612460
