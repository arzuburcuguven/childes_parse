@Comment:	Time is 1:58
@Comment:	Chi works independently for awhile as Mot does other things in the kitchen. Mot doesn't want to tell Chi what to write about. Chi checks the spelling of a word with Mot , and gets a little annoyed when Mot asks him to repeat out loud another word he asks her the spelling of. Mot comments on how Chi forms his letters (like p) , and tells him to write on the lines (instead of above them). Chi writes silently. At end Mot makes some suggestions and also corrects things on the letter herself. I think she changes a few letters and writes the date. Chi uses Dear Eric Carle and want to fold the letter (presumably to send) but also has <by Chi> at top and <the end> at the bottom. So he's a little unclear about format differences for letters versus stories.
