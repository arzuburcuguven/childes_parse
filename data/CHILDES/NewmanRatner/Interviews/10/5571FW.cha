*PAR0:	I'd just like to go over basically what you thought he was most interested in today . 0_8300
*PAR0:	okay . 8300_10220
*PAR0:	well I think actually compared to last time I think he was interested in more things today . 10220_16320
*PAR0:	like he actually seemed interested in the book . 16320_19140
*PAR0:	and the last time I don't think he was interested in those really at all he seemed a little bit interested in the stuffed animals and in the baby doll . 19140_26780
*PAR0:	<bless you> [/] bless you . 26780_29840
*PAR0:	yeah I'd say it was sort of a toss up between the &-um the play dishes and food and the baby doll . 29840_39240
*PAR0:	it seemed to . 39240_39920
*PAR0:	but I think he's m &-um he interests himself in the dishes and things like that . 40240_46100
*PAR0:	but I was able to interest him in the baby doll by making it do stuff . 46160_49360
*PAR0:	what kind of things were you doing that you thought he was more interested in . 49740_53640
*PAR0:	well &-um I don't think he's interested in the baby doll unto itself per say . 54080_57980
*PAR0:	but by [/] by like m making it move and things like that . 58100_62260
*PAR0:	I think he found that interesting and funny . 62260_64360
*PAR0:	okay . 64820_65060
*PAR0:	and then I noticed you were asking him about &-um body parts . 65300_68740
*PAR0:	mhm . 68880_69160
*PAR0:	of the do you think he was interested in that . 69200_71380
*PAR0:	I don't think he cared . 71640_72640
*PAR0:	he's like . 72920_74560
*PAR0:	what are <I don't think he> [/] I don't think he was . 74560_76360
*PAR0:	hi . 76360_77280
*PAR0:	yeah I don't think it was picking up on that at all . 77280_79680
*PAR0:	don't think I think he was interested in the eyes . 80000_81960
*PAR0:	but I think that's because they were moving . 82060_83660
*PAR0:	and &-um you know I so I but I don't think it's because I was saying what it was . 83980_88880
*PAR0:	okay . 89100_89480
*PAR0:	so you don't think he recognized the . 89760_91480
*PAR0:	different . 91480_91820
*PAR0:	I don't think so . 92280_93500
*PAR0:	I don't think at this point . 93600_94480
*PAR0:	&-um he does like to grab people's faces . 94820_97480
*PAR0:	anyway . 97480_97860
*PAR0:	so in doing that with a baby doll . 97980_99500
*PAR0:	I mean that's sort of like what he does now . 99500_101820
*PAR0:	okay . 102060_102500
*PAR0:	so well sometimes his little nails gonna come out . 103060_106580
*PAR0:	it's very hard to keep them trim well trimmed . 106800_109300
*PAR0:	so what about the different foods that you may have played with . 109760_113660
*PAR0:	were there any you thought he might recognize . 113820_115680
*PAR0:	well he's had peas before in this like mashed &-uh format . 116200_120940
*PAR0:	he's not had ice cream or &-uh probably any of the other . 121100_127360
*PAR0:	he hasn't had peanut butter or pizza . 127480_128840
*PAR0:	obviously he's had a waffle before . 128840_130580
*PAR0:	but we didn't get that far . 130580_131740
*PAR0:	he's had wheat free waffle actually because he's not doing wheat yet . 131800_134200
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh so <he might> [/] he might recognize certain things from us eating them possibly . 134960_141760
*PAR0:	but I don't think he recognizes anything yet . 141760_143840
*PAR0:	I think he's more interested in the texture and like this is bumpy . 144280_148860
*PAR0:	and I think he liked that . 148860_150100
*PAR0:	I think he liked making noise with the different things . 150240_152360
*PAR0:	so I think that's what interests him at this point . 152440_156640
*PAR0:	oh the spoon he probably recognizes . 156640_160840
*PAR0:	yeah . 160840_161280
*PAR0:	because he [/] he gets to play with one of those . 161280_163720
*PAR0:	okay . 164160_164440
*PAR0:	and then you mentioned the books . 164440_166080
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 166520_166580
*PAR0:	which ones did you play with today . 166600_168420
*PAR0:	&-uh we played with what he grabbed was the on the farm book . 168680_172280
*PAR0:	mhm . 172480_172720
*PAR0:	so . 172900_173220
*PAR0:	okay . 174060_174800
*PAR0:	and in general do you think he likes to play with books or toys more at home . 175000_179300
*PAR0:	you mean . 179300_179600
*PAR0:	mhm . 179640_179880
*PAR0:	he's not all that interested in books to . 180060_182360
*PAR0:	be honest . 182360_182780
*PAR0:	and he definitely I think likes to play with toys more . 183020_186240
*PAR0:	&-um and it's funny because my older son liked everything but you know at this age would definitely like watch you read the book and things this one not at all occasionally . 186960_197740
*PAR0:	but it is that's like I mean this is actually pretty good for him that he let me &-um read &-uh &-um the book to him . 197740_205320
*PAR0:	and we have tons of board books . 205600_206720
*PAR0:	but he it's just usually he's either too distracted or I don't know doesn't it's not the well I mean we'll keep at it . 206800_215860
*PAR0:	but &-um right now he doesn't seem interested in that so much . 215860_219020
*PAR0:	he likes to make the noise . 219160_221060
*PAR0:	oh yeah well he yeah he likes to I mean and right now I think what's [/] what's big in his focus is he loves to push toys like [/] like he likes to push a stroller and walk it . 221580_232040
*PAR0:	likes he likes being &-um holding onto your fingers and walking . 232040_235920
*PAR0:	that's his big thing right now . 236120_237300
*PAR0:	but he does I mean he does &-um play with toys and things like that at [/] at &-um at home . 237400_244660
*PAR0:	so and we have you know things that are similar . 244960_247260
*PAR0:	we have dishes . 247400_247840
*PAR0:	he does have some stuffed animals &-um blocks things like that . 248140_252080
*PAR0:	are there any stuffed or any animals that you think he might know the names of or people know him . 252760_257980
*PAR0:	doubt it . 258000_258520
*PAR0:	I mean maybe Teddy bear . 258660_260700
*PAR0:	but he doesn't have for example Winnie the pooh . 260880_262840
*PAR0:	so I don't know if he'd be able to . 262840_264160
*PAR0:	yeah oof yeah it's scary . 265500_270920
*PAR0:	I don't know . 270920_272700
*PAR0:	maybe bear . 272700_275620
*PAR0:	I mean he's seen frogs before he's . 275620_278140
*PAR0:	seen I mean we have some puppets too like a lion and a chicken and a horse and things . 278140_285500
*PAR0:	but I don't think he honestly I don't think he picks up on the different names at this point . 285500_290640
*PAR0:	okay . 291180_291920
*PAR0:	and then the sound makers that for him today were you were saying . 292440_297120
*PAR0:	oh he yeah he was like the pitcher and banging it on the things . 297600_301980
*PAR0:	&-um and [/] and he's also I think teething . 302580_306360
*PAR0:	so he likes to put that in his mouth . 306360_308700
*PAR0:	I should get you a real one . 309060_310800
*PAR0:	so that would be nice . 311260_314560
*PAR0:	well not yet no [/] no milk yet . 315420_317620
*PAR0:	&-um and then did we &-uh did I ask you what you thought . 318600_321500
*PAR0:	he interested him the least I think the stuffed animals other than the kangaroo [/] kangaroo one . 321500_327560
*PAR0:	he didn't really seem all that interested in them . 327560_330860
*PAR0:	so but he kind of did play with a little bit of everything . 330860_336580
*PAR0:	which <I just> [/] I just remember it . 336580_339900
*PAR0:	I heard you counting . 339900_340760
*PAR0:	do you think he's becoming familiar with any of the or . 340760_344640
*PAR0:	no I mean &-uh I [/] I think that &-um you know <when we> [/] when we think about it we do try to &-um point out stuff to him like colors or shapes or animals and things . 344640_357380
*PAR0:	but &-uh at this point I think he just he's just more interested in being with somebody than you know . 357380_364220
*PAR0:	so I doubt very much . 364220_366560
*PAR0:	that's probably the least of his worries at this point of figuring that out . 366560_370760
*PAR0:	that's fair . 370760_371900
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah oh great . 372160_377120
*PAR0:	oh you're so excited . 377920_381440
*PAR0:	he does like food . 382780_384420
*PAR0:	you know I don't even know if he knows it's food . 384420_386980
*PAR0:	honestly they could be blocks or something you . 386980_389520
*PAR0:	know I think . 389520_390000
*PAR0:	but <he likes> [/] he likes the different shapes and the different sounds they make . 390000_393420
*PAR0:	yeah . 393420_395000
*PAR0:	well great . 395000_396980
*PAR0:	I'm going to this [/] this portion is done . 396980_401400
*PAR0:	okay . 401400_401800
*PAR0:	I'm going see how Audrey's doing . 401800_404040
*PAR0:	okay . 404040_404340
*PAR0:	we can see how Audrey's actually . 404340_405740
*PAR0:	so you . 405740_406420
*PAR0:	well I'd like to take a quick bathroom break from me if that's okay . 406420_409160
