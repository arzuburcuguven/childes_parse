*PAR0:	I'm gonna talk to mom . 0_1160
*PAR0:	okay . 1160_1460
*PAR0:	so can you tell me about what you guys played with . 1460_4060
*PAR0:	what did we play with . 4060_4900
*PAR0:	&-um he mostly played with the food items which they have at his daycare . 4900_9640
*PAR0:	&-uh they have a whole sink stove and refrigerator set . 10060_12560
*PAR0:	and he really [/] really liked playing with them . 12660_15260
*PAR0:	he was making a whole meal . 15320_16540
*PAR0:	he took the sauce pan . 16920_18080
*PAR0:	and he was emptying food into it . 18080_20600
*PAR0:	and then he put it into the bowl . 20660_21960
*PAR0:	and he put it back into the saucepan . 22140_24220
*PAR0:	and it's really interesting because a lot of times when I'm cooking I'll explain to him what I'm doing . 24220_28680
*PAR0:	so &-um it was funny to like watch him mimic the same type of things that I'm explaining to him when I'm doing it . 28680_36600
*PAR0:	so &-um so that was neat . 36600_38200
*PAR0:	but yeah he really liked the food . 38200_40760
*PAR0:	and then seemed somewhat interested in the dolls but more like interested in their shoes . 40760_45720
*PAR0:	and &-um and then he went over and sort of playing with the animal magnets . 45720_51720
*PAR0:	but I [/] I was surprised . 51720_53320
*PAR0:	he wasn't really that interested in these the like more real like life like looking ones . 53320_58860
*PAR0:	yeah that's kind of interesting for me because he's really interested in animals . 59000_63320
*PAR0:	and he especially really likes to watch like videos of like mice and stuff like that . 63320_69100
*PAR0:	and he didn't seem interested at all in playing with the realistic ones . 69100_74240
*PAR0:	but there he is back at the food . 74240_76400
*PAR0:	you like the food . 76400_77660
*PAR0:	don't you babe . 77660_79280
*PAR0:	does he have anything like the . 79280_92320
*PAR0:	yeah those are cool . 92320_93440
*PAR0:	it's [/] it's funny maybe because he's used to playing with food . 93440_95860
*PAR0:	like he likes that better . 95860_97780
*PAR0:	I don't know . 97780_98600
*PAR0:	maybe he's more familiar with it . 98600_100400
*PAR0:	it seems like things . 100400_101800
*PAR0:	that he's really familiar with . 101800_103220
*PAR0:	he's more comfortable with . 103220_104920
*PAR0:	he likes to explore new things . 104920_106800
*PAR0:	but he does seem to show preference for things that he's more comfortable with maybe too because he's usually sees the dolls that he sees . 106800_115700
*PAR0:	he has a doll that's a baby doll . 115700_117680
*PAR0:	not this is not quite a baby doll . 117680_120580
*PAR0:	this is one of the you know an older child's doll . 120580_123880
*PAR0:	so &-um maybe that was the difference too . 123880_127800
*PAR0:	did he play with the baby doll at the other one at the other sessions he did . 128600_131920
*PAR0:	yeah he and it was more like he'd pick it up . 131920_134500
*PAR0:	and he'd pat it on its back and try to feed it . 134500_136840
*PAR0:	but he didn't like interact with it that much . 136840_140000
*PAR0:	he has a baby doll at home that he does the same type of thing with . 140000_143740
*PAR0:	but he doesn't like really sing to it or cuddle it . 143740_146900
*PAR0:	<he didn't> [/] he didn't play with it the way that I played with a baby doll when I was little . 146900_150520
*PAR0:	so that was interesting too . 150840_153040
*PAR0:	does air you guy like kinda getting him used to the idea of a new baby too . 154160_157420
*PAR0:	yep exactly . 157420_158340
*PAR0:	so I'm like we feed the baby . 158340_160260
*PAR0:	and we take care of the baby . 160260_161660
*PAR0:	so that was the primary motivation for getting the baby doll . 161660_165780
*PAR0:	is it a do you know if it's a girl or boy it's a little boy . 166380_169000
*PAR0:	aw it's actually anatomically correct . 169160_171220
*PAR0:	so we know it's a little boy doll stripe jumper like a sleeper . 171220_188360
*PAR0:	aw that's cute . 188400_190220
*PAR0:	and <you said> [/] you said like he tries to in the kitchen like help you out or like ask you what you're doing . 191160_196920
*PAR0:	a lot . 196920_197560
*PAR0:	he does . 197560_197900
*PAR0:	and I he watches a . 197900_199560
*PAR0:	lot I'll [/] I'll let him sit at the table and watch me . 199560_202260
*PAR0:	and I'll bring the food over and show him like this is what I'm doing . 202340_204940
*PAR0:	and this is how I'm making it . 205160_206480
*PAR0:	so &-um that was interesting . 207360_208940
*PAR0:	how much he was imitating . 208940_210200
*PAR0:	yeah . 210360_210960
*PAR0:	do you think he recognized food that he was playing with . 211280_214100
*PAR0:	yeah . 214100_214740
*PAR0:	<and he> [/] and he would pick up like green beans and peas and things that he was used to eating . 214740_221720
*PAR0:	he didn't really talk that much . 222020_223360
*PAR0:	which he usually doesn't . 223360_224520
*PAR0:	he's usually when he plays I notice he usually is like I could it's almost like I could see him like mentally processing things . 224580_235160
*PAR0:	like he's like analyzing as he's playing . 235160_237780
*PAR0:	and he doesn't really talk a whole lot . 237780_239980
*PAR0:	it's like he's learning as he's playing . 239980_242540
*PAR0:	so &-um I wasn't surprised that he didn't really talk much to me because he was playing independently . 242540_249700
*PAR0:	he try to like engage you with what he's doing or a lot of times . 250660_253740
*PAR0:	he'll even if I'm like sitting on the couch he'll bring me down and ask me to sit [/] sit [/] sit mommy . 253740_259260
*PAR0:	and he's seen you eat some of these things too . 260020_263020

*PAR0:	we eat them together as a family . 263780_265480
*PAR0:	it's funny because he talks about pizza all the time . 265840_268980
*PAR0:	but we don't really have it very often . 268980_271220
*PAR0:	I'm I have food allergies . 271220_272760
*PAR0:	I'm allergic to dairy and wheat . 272760_274100
*PAR0:	so the only time that we have it is if I make it from scratch which it's a lot of work . 274100_279360
*PAR0:	so I usually don't . 279360_281080
*PAR0:	yeah . 281080_281560
*PAR0:	so it's [/] it's funny . 281560_283320
