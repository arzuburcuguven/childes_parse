@Comment:	MOT tells Chi that they need to write a letter to the author. Chi begins the letter by herself , with Mot quickly interjecting suggestions on punctuation and format. Chi initiates her own ideas , but Mot eventually leads Chi through much of the rest of the content. Mot often assists Chi with spelling and punctuation but keeps her comments light and encouraging. Chi knows to sign the letter but Mot says to put address at bottom. After finishing the writing process , Chi reads the letter out loud and receives much affirmation from EXP.
