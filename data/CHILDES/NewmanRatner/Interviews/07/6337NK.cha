*PAR0:	can I ask you some questions now . 2620_5560
*PAR0:	sure . 5560_6300
*PAR0:	alright . 6300_7080
*PAR0:	I'm gonna actually let's position him more over here that way . 7080_11600
*PAR0:	he's away from the wire as well we talk . 11600_13920
*PAR0:	and he'll feel safe . 13920_14880
*PAR0:	I know what you're talking about . 14880_16260
*PAR0:	&-um so what do you think his favorite thing to play with . 16260_22820
*PAR0:	I don't know any of the plastic stuff that he could stick in his mouth . 22820_27120
*PAR0:	I don't know that he was focused on any one of them specifically . 27120_29960
*PAR0:	but I you know anytime I tried to give him a book or a stuffed animal he didn't care . 29960_35100
*PAR0:	he anything plastic that he can stick in his mouth . 35100_37360
*PAR0:	I think it [/] it was [/] was &-um like [/] like the [/] the [/] the color [/] color or [/] or the [/] the material [/] material I [/] <I think> [/] I think it's partly the color and sometimes the shape too . 38220_46840
*PAR0:	he also liked the soup cans which I think those are wood . 46840_48920
*PAR0:	so but anything that he can get his hand around and put get into his mouth because that's pretty much what he does is . 48920_55460
*PAR0:	he chews on stuff . 55460_56460
*PAR0:	so it he didn't I don't know that he necessarily favored any particular thing . 56460_61200
*PAR0:	the bottle and the pizza I think were probably the ones he played with the most . 61200_64200
*PAR0:	but &-um anything <any of> [/] any of this stuff in the middle seemed to be . 64200_73740
*PAR0:	yeah . 73740_76060
*PAR0:	&-um how do you what [/] what do you think was his least favorite of anything . 76060_81220
*PAR0:	I think probably the stuffed animals . 81540_83140
*PAR0:	yeah I m you know brought a couple over . 84660_87600
*PAR0:	and he looked at them for a second was like . 87860_89300
*PAR0:	Psh can't be bothered . 89300_91000
*PAR0:	he sat and listened to the book . 91560_93280
*PAR0:	the like when I was reading or you know even he like . 93280_95980
*PAR0:	grabbed at them a couple times . 95980_97220
*PAR0:	but then interest when he noticed that there was still all this other stuff to play with . 97420_102260
*PAR0:	do you &-um re take do you read books at home . 102260_105900
*PAR0:	we do &-um he doesn't . 105900_107860
*PAR0:	and he his babysitter reads him books a lot too . 107860_109980
*PAR0:	&-um he doesn't always sit still for the whole thing . 109980_112800
*PAR0:	but like we can kind of wrangle him . 112800_114500
*PAR0:	and you know hang on to him . 114500_116140
*PAR0:	especially like when there's other stuff to distract him . 116140_118320
*PAR0:	like if we just sit in his room without other toys around and read a book like he tends to do pretty well with it . 118320_124640
*PAR0:	but like if there's something there that like he likes to play with that you know like we were sitting here . 124640_129440
*PAR0:	and he saw that there was other stuff to play with . 129440_131460
*PAR0:	and so he was like . 131460_132540
*PAR0:	short attention span . 132540_133680
*PAR0:	do we have any of the same books that you have at home . 134200_137740
*PAR0:	I think we might have the Peekaboo book this one . 137740_140780
*PAR0:	okay . 140780_141540
*PAR0:	so we've probably only read that like once or twice . 141540_143900
*PAR0:	so we have a lot of books . 143900_145120
*PAR0:	we had a book shower . 145120_146220
*PAR0:	so do you play Peekaboo at home . 146220_148980

*PAR0:	well we noticed he [/] he got what was going on when he got out of the shower one day . 154580_158480
*PAR0:	and we threw the bath towel over him . 158480_160020
*PAR0:	he and we were like . 160880_162120
*PAR0:	<where is Nathan> [/] where is Nathan and he pulled it off his own face . 162120_164660

*PAR0:	yeah that was a couple months ago . 166740_168820
*PAR0:	and so he loves to do that . 169020_170260
*PAR0:	now he loves to do that . 170260_171280
*PAR0:	now he doesn't like cover up his face with his hands or anything . 171280_173860
*PAR0:	but like if he's his face is covered up with a blanket or a towel or something like he'll pull it off when he you know he'll realize we're playing Peekaboo and pull it off . 173860_181180
*PAR0:	so do you &-um have dolls at home . 181180_186720
*PAR0:	&-um we have like it's like it looks like a doll . 186720_189700

*PAR0:	&-um there's another little boy and his babysitter that he like he plays with . 354180_361880
*PAR0:	they're about I think they're like a month apart . 361880_363680
*PAR0:	and &-um maybe five weeks and no that's mommy's . 363680_369160
*PAR0:	&-um and he tends they like to what is that can bang on that makes noise too . 369160_392040
*PAR0:	like the babysitter has a little piano he likes to play with . 392040_394780
*PAR0:	and like she has those little things that pop you push the button . 394780_397520
*PAR0:	and it pops up . 397520_398420

*PAR0:	he likes to bang on and make noise . 403280_405000
*PAR0:	but he definitely doesn't like know . 405240_406680
*PAR0:	oh if I push this button it's gonna do this like it's more of a banging thing at this point . 406680_410860
*PAR0:	&-um but he [/] he and the other little boy will sit and play together . 411400_415560
*PAR0:	and &-uh they [/] they stroke each other's head and stuff but know sometimes they grab toys out of each others hands and stuff like that . 415920_426400
*PAR0:	and so we were discussing like . 426400_428060
*PAR0:	how do you work on sharing you know with a baby this little . 428060_431340
*PAR0:	yeah . 431340_431840
*PAR0:	so <we're trying> [/] we're trying aww so that they'll play . 431840_436140
*PAR0:	nice . 436140_436540
*PAR0:	do you think he played with the this baby doll does with the bear at home . 437020_443520
*PAR0:	&-um yeah kinda cause you know he chewed on it . 443520_447380
*PAR0:	&-um but and also like he's he does I was trying to watch and see if he was &-um acting with the doll like he does with other people . 447380_454920
*PAR0:	and he tends to . 455200_456480
*PAR0:	actually &-um like especially new people . 456480_459360
*PAR0:	he likes to grab their faces like that's how he explores . 459360_462200
*PAR0:	so that was the first thing he did with the doll . 462940_464700
*PAR0:	and then he'll sometimes too like suck on my neck . 465160_468140
*PAR0:	you know what I mean like <when he's> [/] when he's snuggling he'll especially if he's tired or hungry . 468280_472400
*PAR0:	hey [/] hey eat your ice cream . 472740_477660
*PAR0:	put your shrieking . 478000_478680
*PAR0:	&-um but he I mean he really just likes rolling around on the floor and chewing on stuff and making noise . 478680_486000
*PAR0:	and yeah he's pretty <easy to> [/] easy to please . 486000_492580
*PAR0:	&-um I had a question . 494180_497160

*PAR0:	and I think on my husband and I were talking about that last night . 502880_506140
*PAR0:	that's enough like he'll I think he understands tone more . 506520_511020
*PAR0:	no . 511540_512080
*PAR0:	and <he gets> [/] he gets that I'm covering his mouth . 513000_517380
*PAR0:	and he's supposed to stop . 517380_518300
*PAR0:	and then when I take my hand away he'll start up again you know like he's [/] he's definitely getting the defiance thing down too early on . 518300_524180
*PAR0:	but &-um he I mean I think he understands tone more than he understands words you know what I mean . 524180_534000
*PAR0:	yeah . 534920_535240
*PAR0:	like he'll definitely respond to . 535240_536700
*PAR0:	no if I like you know if my tone is [/] is urgent you know . 536700_542580
*PAR0:	yeah . 542580_543100
*PAR0:	and like if he's about to pull the stereo onto his head . 543100_547860
*PAR0:	and I say . 547860_548360
*PAR0:	no he'll stop what he's doing . 548360_550400
*PAR0:	and [/] and fight back . 550400_554040
*PAR0:	and then well he'll stop and look at me for a second . 554040_556680
*PAR0:	and then I'll keep going you know but I mean he stops and looks for a second . 556680_560180
*PAR0:	so I think he [/] he gets the tone at least that . 560180_563380
*PAR0:	like . 563380_563740
*PAR0:	oh well something's not right but I'm just gonna keep I'm gonna keep playing . 563740_568980

*PAR0:	probably less of that though . 662740_667140
*PAR0:	like he's definitely an independent player . 667460_669180
*PAR0:	he really likes to just sit and play by himself . 669400_671200
*PAR0:	and sometimes we'll sit and try to play . 671380_672880
*PAR0:	with him . 672880_673240
*PAR0:	and he'll be like . 673280_673900
