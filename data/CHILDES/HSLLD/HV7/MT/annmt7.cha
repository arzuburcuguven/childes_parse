@Comment:	Present during this mealtime (dinner) are Chi , MOT , FAT , Chi's young COU , Chi's GMA , and MAL , an unidentified adult male relative. As Chi lives with two of her uncles this might be one of them. Also , Chi's aunt Linda is in another room talking , probably on the phone , during the entire mealtime , and her words are heard here and there. The television is on in the background also during the entire mealtime. Often the conversation is a little confusing because the family members are often walking around and having many side conversations and making noise. COU and GMA have a running conversation during most of the mealtime , usually dominating the conversation at the dinner table. Chi enters this conversation frequently , and Mot , FAT , and MAL do briefly. Outside of this conversation , the family members discuss a few things , but mostly they center around the meal.
