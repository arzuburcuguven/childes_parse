*CHI:	what's this ?
@Comment:	Time is 15:00 , FAT and Chi play well together , but they don't talk to each other a lot. EXP stays in the background. For the most part , FAT and Chi spend the activity building different towers. Chi leads the activities , and Fat takes a mild interest in the activity. Discussion dealing with the magnetic qualities of the object is limited to a question Chi asks about why the yellow wand is pulling and a comment made by Fat that there's metal in the balls. Chi's question is not answered , or acknowledged. Chi does a little experimenting: she notices that the turtle and a nickel are not magnetic.
*FAT:	magnet .
*CHI:	cool .
