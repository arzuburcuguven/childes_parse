@Comment:	Chi completes the letter writing task in a room full of noisy children. She doesn't seem distracted by them or by Mot asking them to leave every so often. She shares what she is going to write with Mot , and includes some of her suggestions , but seems very capable of writing the letter without any help. She asks EXP if Eric Carle will write back to her. When Mot asks her why she writes sincerely if she doesn't know what it means , Chi answers <because I like the way it sounds>.
