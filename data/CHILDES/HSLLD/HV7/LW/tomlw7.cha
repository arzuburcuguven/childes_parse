@Comment:	MOT suggested that Chi reread the book to refresh his and her memory before starting the task. After some discussion about Chi's favorite part of the story , MOT asked Chi how he would start the letter. She suggested addressing the author as <Mr Carle> instead of <Eric Carle>. Throughout the letter writing task , MOT asked Chi questions which started discussions about the book. Both Mot and Chi came up with ideas for the letter. Chi often asked Mot how to spell something , and Mot would say <close your eyes and visualize> so that he would figure it out for himself. When he got stuck or could not guess the right letter , MOT would give the correct spelling. Mot also helped with punctuation and capitalization , and suggested that Chi make a new paragraph at one point in the letter. Rapport between Mot and Chi was excellent. Mot was extremely encouraging , supportive , and patient.
