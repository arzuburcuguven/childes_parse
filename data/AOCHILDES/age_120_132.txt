someones hitting me with a balloon
under the table
on my foot
i feel long underwear and it must be
no it cant be bro

i think he went somewhere with dunston the monkey
but they went off together in a taxi
he didnt leave
oh he just pretended he left
where do you think he is
well i just think bro left and he didnt even say goodbye to us
here he is
careful with the balloon
dont talk
dont talk
what do you mean dont talk
whos gonna keep mummy company at the breakfast table
mom stop
can you can you give me attention
can i give you what
when im seeing dunston unde under the table because when im gone
i always give you attention

when i say

but i cant do that
but i sat with you for hours yesterday bro

i always give you attention
im talking to brother before he goes to school

when i stay under the table when i see dunston
go under the table
when i say
okay goodbye
now bros gone again
yeah so because they switched the practice back to six clock it doesnt give you as much time before practice
so i thought wed get that done right away
now today is the twenty third
your puzzle projects due tomorrow
well the book is read so this afternoon what do we do cut out the pieces of the puzzle and you just write the different clues
and then it fits together like a square or something
do you need a piece of posterboard to put it on
well i needta run out today so is there anything that you need for it
more pencils
do we need a new pencil sharpener again
because mummy lost that one at church
you know i wasnt even thinking when i was working on that card last night
because i was using one of the marking pens for the laundry
to do the black border for the
hi honey
-um of the card
now say
there he is
not you
chi and you
chi look
there he is
shut up
im gonna hit you i can that i want
good thing its only a balloon
your brother wouldve been bruised all over the way youve been beating him with it bro
ill show you
doesnt that come out nice
and then what i do is when i cut the arch into like a stained glass window
this s piece here and this piece here and then s around the edge is gonna have to be black
thats the lead in the stained glass window you see
so the this is for the older children in sunday school
i shouldnt call them children theyre young adults
then i have to design one for the younger children
but see what happened when i was coloring in to do my leaded stained glass with the black marker
so i cant draw my wheat and my grapes on the inside because
i shouldve put a piece of cardboard in there
but i cant do it like that i have to make sure that it it matches
look at that
well the one good thing is is that i can quickly trace over this
because my drawing is so dark
but i needta remember to put something in the middle here so it will not bleed through
well so thats nice huh
but i havent decided what to do for the children
you know like bros age
i still like my original though
on on the -um
so heres my what do you think
i was thinking of writing that down the bottom or maybe across the front
no i think ill call pastor or stephanie and run it by them
no only in one spot
i dont know
i still have to come up with what
stephanie and i have to figure out what were gonna put inside for a prayer
do you have homework this week for first communion class
you dont have any homework
no reason to stop right here
well i had it taperecorder going before but you didnt know it

a while ago
sometimes i think that its not a bad idea to start it up without anybody knowing it
it said
im sorry
well bro has school today
and i have to pick him up so i needta come get you at school
instead i have him get on the bus
no which means we will not get here until like almost three thirty
so that takes out some time of your homework too so
do you want some more apple jacks
i know
i had a coupon for them
well ill ask melissa if shes gonna use her coupon
if shes not ill ill get it from her
thats enough please
may i have it cereal box
thank you
box of cereal lasted approximately twelve hours
they liked apple jacks
did you have any yet dad
i had some this morning
i havent had them in so long
theres nothing in them im just
i already did that
i just do that every one thing
more milk
that bowls full of milk chi first and middle name
yes it is
i couldnt put more milk in it if you wanted me to
youd be floating down the hallway
his basketball practice has been switched back to six instead of seven
which kind of cuts across for me you know what i mean time wise with dinner on tuesdays with picking bro up at school
but thats the story
yeah so
you know i dont
im on your side
whatever makes it easier
is this your math homework for tomorrow today i mean
honey i really want you to start using the graph paper i got you so you can make some better organizational skills in terms of keeping your numbers square
you keeping them ov over and b up above and below the right way youre doing better with that and your decimal points
but in terms of the size and youre going up hill when you do your problems or down hill
with the the graph paper will help you get into a better habit
well still
you know what im saying
youre going up hill
you gotta keep all your numbers the same size
yeah but he needs to use the same amount of space for a problem
and i thats why i got him the graph paper
that will help
so how come hes using that paper
you know thats what they give you at school for math
and of course theyre not gonna spend money on graph paper
when im down there the table can you say something from the table

the very hungry caterpillar
for my sister christa
in the light of the moon a little egg laid on a leaf
one sunday morning the warm sun came up an and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar
oh yeah mr suns happy today
he started to look for some food
on monday he ate through one apple but he was still hungry
on tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still
on wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry
on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry
on friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry
look at all that junk
chocolate cake
one pickle
one slice of salami
one piece of cherry pie
one cupcake
that night he had a stomachache
the next day was sunday again
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he lef felt much better
now he wasnt hungry anymore and he wasnt a little caterpillar anymore
he was a big fat caterpillar
he built a small house called a cocoon around himself
he stayed inside for more than two weeks
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and
he was a beautiful butterfly
looks like he tried to eat through this book too
thanks chi for doing that

tied isnt it
yeah it is
you gotta clean that thing up off

clogs up your pores and makes you you have pimples
where you going

i dont remember buying orange cheese
do you remember eating orange cheese
now how do you suppose that happened
they could have been disguised as yellow cheese
orange cheese
i like the yellow cheese
hey look
they wanna hear about our orange cheese argument
why else would it be of interest to anyone to tape a dinner conversation
because someone in this world loves orange juice
fans unite
another friend of orange cheese
not cheese
velveeta is not cheese
fake cheese
its yeah its fake cheese
im cold
cheese whiz
-uh bring back the book
what do you what did you say

yeah well -um i dont know why
this size
i never heard that before
at the pet store
well chi i just wanted to help
because i wanted to see what these things thin flat refrigerator-type magnets were
only two balls can stick together
you might have a green one
oh my god
hm sure
oh yeah
its its magnet set maybe for both of you
you can have whatever you want
its just making a design
well if theyre the same on both sides
i think thats what a design
percent sign
i get you
now maybe someone is brilliant
i know
but i cant
let me see the box black base
there must be a magnet in the box black base
oh i like watching these balls on black base
i like those magnetic balls
im not timmy o toole
i think just the bar is
oh you got it
i think just the bar yellow wand is
not these washers and silver pieces because theyre not sticking to each other
i cant get this guy silver man to stand up
i got one a silver men to stand
not right now
its gonna stick to this
that blue plastic bear doesnt stick to anything
neither does this blue arrow magnet
i know but how come nothing else will stick to this black base
its blue arrow not really sticking because its like i used all the magnets black base power
its blue arrows not
its blue arrow like to big to stick
looks like a tool tower of nuts on the wand
get out
well i got the guy silver man to stand up first
well stand him silver man on this black base
-uh hes silver mans kind of laying over
this magnet one in the black base is really strong in this box black base
oh i could lean him silver man and do it stand the silver man in a leaning position too
feel how stro
when you put this silver man down on black base feel it magnetic force pulling
can you feel it black base pulling him silver man
feel right here a certain spot on the black base where this her silver man is
i dont think so
its square thin magnet not sticking on that black base or yellow wand either
i know
but theyd thin magnets stick to that yellow wand too but there not enough magnet in them
i know
it blue arrow wasnt sticking to this black base
i didnt say it blue arrow wouldnt stick to anything
i got it silver man to stand on the silver stick to work already once
i got one guy silver man to stand on his head
then i had one guy silver man on each step silver stick
it was my fault
youre done
now hes done
all done
thanks for doing that
these are some objects that we asked you to play with like four years ago
oh thats good
is that a light
whats that
somebody bro looks interested in that
i put that up there because it rolls
can you pick them various objects all up with that yellow wand
can you pick everything up with it yellow wand
a turtle
oh what did you do
you left the balls going in a circle
that referent unclear ought to go over there
what happening bro
look at that wand stuck to base
oh jeez
wh watch your sister play with the balls huh
i dont think its referent unclear that strong
thats objects stuck to base pretty good
there you go

careful it silver stick doesnt stick into here
that piece that was just sticking out

that red thing horseshoe magnet
you could put ear rings in it face construction
use the two little monkeys there
or men
ear rings
these referent unclear all came out

see if this will silver man stand on it black base
so that one magnet ball jumped on top of the other one magnet ball
do that one magnet ball
theres one over there too
it construction of silver men stacked on one another gets weaker as it goes up higher
it magnetic force gets stronger that way
lets see what you got
wait a minute
hes lifting heavy weights
