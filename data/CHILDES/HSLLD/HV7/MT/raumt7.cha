@Comment:	Present at this mealtime was Mot , Chi , and Chi's younger brother. The tv was on throughout the meal in the background. Chi and Bro commented on the meal a few times. They did not say much else , so that Mot grew angry and yelled at them for not saying anything , and promptly turned the tape recorder off. It was hard sometimes to distinguish between Chi and Bro , especially because they are only one or two years apart , so some of their utterances may be ascribed to the wrong child.
