@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	23-JAN-1994
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Comment:	Chi and Bro are playing with the magnets simultaneously , but separately. In order for this transcript to be comprehensible , only Chi's activities with the magnets are recorded , except in places when Chi and Bro are interacting. The transcript JAKET7.TXT has Bro's interaction with the magnets , and the transcript FULLET7.TXT has both children's interactions recorded simultaneously (but it is very hard to follow)
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*CHI:	what's this ?
@Comment:	Time is 37:34
@Comment:	Chi , Chi's twin Bro , and Mot are present at this activity. Chi and Bro play independently of each other , interacting rarely. Chi experiments with how high he can build towers. A large proportion of Chi's speech is to himself , mainly thinking out loud or describing what he does as he does it. At one point , MOT mistakes a metal piece for a magnet , and Chi shows her that it's only the pieces' indirect connection with the strength of the magnetic base which allows them to stick together. A couple of times , Chi engages in fantasy play. Although Chi interacts very little with the other people in the room , the interactions he does have are generally cheerful and pleasant , although at one point he does emphatically correct Mot when she describes the boys' art projects to EXP incorrectly. Videotape does not start until later , up until that point transcript is from audio tape only

*CHI:	hey [<] .
%int:	breathy
%sit:	Chi discovers an interesting trick with the two silver men: the two men are touching at the point of contact with the black base; when Chi pushes one silver man so that it is straight up and down (perpendicular to the base of the magnet) , the other silver man becomes suspended at a 45 degree angle <this shape>; when he pulls the first silver man back , the second one snaps into the straight up and down position , and the first one is suspended at 45 degrees on the opposite side <this shape>
%act:	experiments with his silver man trick for the next 0:30 or so

%com:	videotape continues at this point
%sit:	in the intervening time , Chi has built an elaborate construction on the black base; most of the metal pieces and silver men are now on the black base; Chi has arranged many of the pieces so that the nuts and silver mans are standing on washers , which are stacked straight up and down rather than flat
