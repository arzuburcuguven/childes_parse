@Media:	joeet7, audio, missing
@Comment:	SES of Mot is lower
@Date:	23-JAN-1994
@Location:	Boston , MA USA
@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Comment:	Chi and Bro are playing with the magnets simultaneously , but seperately. In order for this transcript to be comprehensible , only Chi's activities with the magnets are recorded , except in cases when Chi and Bro are interacting. The transcript CALET7.TXT has Bro's interactions with the magnets , and the transcript FULLET7.TXT has both children's interactions recorded simultaneously (but it is very hard to follow).
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*BRO:	what's this ?
@Comment:	Time is 37:34. Videotape does not start until later , up until that point transcript is from audio tape only
@Comment:	Chi plays mainly with the yellow wand , affixing various objects to it. When one of the objects does not stick to a certain point on the wand , Chi and Mot briefly discuss where the wand is magnetic. Unlike Bro's abstract creations , Chi several times builds representational constructions , including a hulk figure and a play+ground. Although for the most part Chi and Bro ignore one another , Chi does initiate some very brief interactions with Bro. Chi interacts a great deal with both Mot and EXP , showing them his creations. Chi seems to enjoy the magnet play very much. Chi's interactions are emotionally very positive and cheerful , although there is a somewhat strained interaction in which Mot criticizes and Chi defends what the boys and their father do when they go to visit him.
