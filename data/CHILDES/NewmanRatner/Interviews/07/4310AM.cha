*PAR0:	I don't need you to get any more . 0_1000
*PAR0:	&-um I'm tape recording this . 1000_3940
*PAR0:	that's why I don't have to write down everything . 4060_5220
*PAR0:	but &-um now I just wanna ask you some questions about what you thought about his &-um preferences and what you thought he liked . 5520_15000
*PAR0:	so you can go ahead and him and he can play with toys . 15560_17560
*PAR0:	sure sit however you want him to sit if you want him on your lap . 17580_19960
*PAR0:	that's fine . 19960_20500
*PAR0:	oh no it's fine . 20620_21540
*PAR0:	&-um it's you're still studying him . 21700_22820
*PAR0:	so it's probably better that he does it himself . 22900_24500
*PAR0:	but right now I just wanna &-uh actually I'm interested in what you observed and thought . 24520_29860
*PAR0:	and &-um particularly about which toys you thought interested him . 30200_34360
*PAR0:	most . 34360_34900
*PAR0:	okay . 35800_36360
*PAR0:	okay . 36660_37080
*PAR0:	&-um well isn't that funny . 37800_39160
*PAR0:	well &-uh I [/] I [/] I think you can tell that . 39560_42100
*PAR0:	s [/] s [/] s right . 42100_43840
*PAR0:	ex initially this interested him in a most that's because . 43840_46720
*PAR0:	well I think besides the color which I know he responds to colors it was something different . 46720_51120
*PAR0:	this was a he's never felt anything like this . 51220_53400
*PAR0:	huh . 53520_53620
*PAR0:	and it was interesting that he [/] he well listen I think I initially picked it up if we could reround it . 53840_59120
*PAR0:	but &-um he right away took to it . 59200_60920
*PAR0:	and he was playing with it when I think about it . 60940_62620
*PAR0:	yeah we don't have any material at home that has this kind of rubbery thing . 62620_65640
*PAR0:	&-uh huh . 66040_66280
*PAR0:	so he seemed to respond to that because he was holding onto it quite a bit . 66320_70460
*PAR0:	I think that just you know initially because it was something well new and the texture . 70940_74740
*PAR0:	mhm . 75180_75400
*PAR0:	&-um but then you know as you see he kind of goes from one toy to the next . 75860_81240
*PAR0:	he loves you know he's always interested in [/] in [/] in activity . 81540_86580
*PAR0:	so move on to the next . 86820_88180
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh that means but he you know anything that he can grab you know get a hold of &-uh huh . 88700_94080
*PAR0:	obviously certain things are familiar . 94180_95760
*PAR0:	the sippy cup the bottle right . 96000_98240
*PAR0:	some [/] some the books the you . 98460_99460
*PAR0:	yes . 99460_100120
*PAR0:	oh yeah the books . 100120_100920
*PAR0:	and you saw he was able to turn the pages himself . 101060_103780
*PAR0:	I know that we haven't quite gotten the &-um the tension level where you know <where we're> [/] where we're thinking . 104600_111080
*PAR0:	sure we're not at the point yet where we have [/] have to read all the words right . 111540_118460
*PAR0:	what's interesting is in the page and the colors and the images . 118460_124560
*PAR0:	I like that . 124560_125880
*PAR0:	he likes anything that he can touch and do things with . 125880_128260
*PAR0:	like . 128260_128460
*PAR0:	that's why he was having fun with this . 128460_130600
*PAR0:	I mean he saw me doing this . 130600_131660
*PAR0:	and he was touching it . 131660_133260
*PAR0:	and of course again the texture of it . 133260_135580
*PAR0:	so that's why he was telling putting us it down about this texture he's familiar with because we have a whole &-uh we have a floor full of this &-uh at home you know where &-uh you know those . 135580_144280
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know those [/] those &-uh the abc boards that take up the whole floor with that material . 144280_150820
*PAR0:	but he loves he he's familiar with it . 150820_153320
*PAR0:	I should say he loves familiar with this texture . 153320_155660
*PAR0:	but again here because he's able to do something with it because he's handling it . 155660_161620
*PAR0:	yeah handling anything like has something on it . 161640_163940
*PAR0:	that he can you know manipulate touch you know . 163940_167220
*PAR0:	see . 167220_167520
*PAR0:	yeah . 167520_167980
*PAR0:	see he's gr so he can grab that anything . 168260_171260
*PAR0:	he can grab manipulate touch . 171260_173160
*PAR0:	&-um just like let's see you know like let's see what he does . 173900_178340
*PAR0:	just begins making to make noise like he knows like when he gets this he knows to make noise with it . 178580_184360
*PAR0:	see he immediately picks it up and knows to shake it . 184580_187580
*PAR0:	&-uh huh &-uh huh . 187760_188760
*PAR0:	seems like he likes that . 189020_190920
*PAR0:	yeah he easily has a little what did you think . 191140_193980
*PAR0:	he likes <the least> [/] the least goodness something that doesn't . 193980_199160
*PAR0:	let's I like least let's see . 200200_202220
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know . 202840_205420
*PAR0:	isn't it funny anything . 205500_206540
*PAR0:	I &-uh that I gave him or that he picked up he played it or checked it out . 206540_210860
*PAR0:	<and then> [/] and then he moved on . 211160_212480
*PAR0:	let's see what did he like . 212600_213260
*PAR0:	I guess actually if anything except that the some of the stuffed animals didn't you know didn't have a noise or just didn't have more than just being a stuffed animal . 213320_222160
*PAR0:	let's see must be he's actually did [/] did not like [/] like . 222340_224520
*PAR0:	what [/] what why do you wanna tell me what would you like to tell me . 225260_228860
*PAR0:	what would you like me to . 229200_230280
*PAR0:	oh don't worry it's okay . 230560_232820
*PAR0:	do you quickly &-um have a sense of which book he liked the most . 233100_237340
*PAR0:	oh isn't it interesting . 237360_238300
*PAR0:	I well what's funny is this one we have at home . 238500_241820
*PAR0:	so he's familiar with it . 241820_242940
*PAR0:	but I actually the texture I think he prefer preferred the one with the texture . 243100_247040
*PAR0:	yeah . 247480_247940
*PAR0:	he seemed to while he was turning the pages with the other book because again it's just a book . 247940_252460
*PAR0:	and he's familiar with turning pages on the book . 252460_254420
*PAR0:	but he . 254420_255340
*PAR0:	yes . 255340_255880
*PAR0:	oh I know what it is . 255880_256840
*PAR0:	it's [/] it's time for actually . 256840_258920
*PAR0:	do you mind if I &-uh here oh it's I don't mind at all . 258920_261380
*PAR0:	here we go . 261380_262340
*PAR0:	honey bunny here we go . 262340_264000
*PAR0:	yes <I know> [/] I know it's time . 264000_266220
*PAR0:	it's time because you had a nice little nap before we came here . 266220_270260
*PAR0:	and I can her then I can talk . 270260_272760
*PAR0:	okay . 272960_273180
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah so the book that of course had the texture . 274300_277020
*PAR0:	he seemed to then go back to more . 277020_279200
*PAR0:	mhm . 279600_279780
*PAR0:	&-um because it was more than just turning the pages it was exploring what was on the page . 280180_284800
*PAR0:	so he seemed to go back to that one more that . 285020_287700
*PAR0:	mhm . 287840_287920
*PAR0:	more definitely . 287920_289700
*PAR0:	as I said the stuffed animal over all the others because it had something unique to him . 289700_295740
*PAR0:	which was his you know rubbery head . 295740_299220
*PAR0:	so I already know the answer to my next question which is . 299220_301240
*PAR0:	do you have any toys like these at home . 301240_303320
*PAR0:	I know you don't have something like that . 303320_304900
*PAR0:	because you just said that . 304900_305540
*PAR0:	don't have that . 305540_306540
*PAR0:	actually I to tell you we don't have &-um these were all new . 306540_309200
*PAR0:	I can't tell you that these were all new to h to him . 309280_311380
*PAR0:	the &-um toys that resemble food . 311720_314120
*PAR0:	we don't have toys that resemble food at home . 314480_316180
*PAR0:	I'm thinking maybe now I should get that . 316300_317700
*PAR0:	but &-um he was in not that he knows peanut butter but [/] but I think anything to him seems like food but . 317980_324120
*PAR0:	&-uh he was obviously familiar with the bottle and the sippy cup because he has those not as toys as real things but these . 324120_330340
*PAR0:	yeah these are new to him . 330340_331480
*PAR0:	toys that are food items are new . 331560_333260
*PAR0:	&-um so that's yeah that he doesn't have at home stuffed animals and books . 333820_339740
*PAR0:	he have I know he's a little young . 339740_342040
*PAR0:	so probably the answer is gonna be no . 342040_344200
*PAR0:	but does he play with &-um with dolls . 344280_347220
*PAR0:	oh actually that's I was gonna say . 347220_348620
*PAR0:	we don't . 348620_349280
*PAR0:	ha I have never that's when I first picked up the doll . 349280_352000
*PAR0:	oh and that was interesting too . 352000_353220
*PAR0:	yeah . 353220_353420
*PAR0:	where is it <right here> [/] right here . 353420_354380
*PAR0:	he did seem &-uh you know that was I do wanna put that in even if you wanna go back to those other questions . 354380_359460
*PAR0:	he definitely seemed interested in it . 359460_361960
*PAR0:	okay . 362160_362340
*PAR0:	&-um yeah . 362340_363080
*PAR0:	as [/] as you know as you saw he was exploring each of you know the ears the nose . 363080_367500
*PAR0:	like he even went for the nose . 367500_368800
*PAR0:	<I was> [/] I was enjoying that he can recognize the little nose . 368800_372040
*PAR0:	but that's probably I mean I know that I'd play with his nose and ears and eyes . 372600_376140
*PAR0:	and we played those games . 376140_377300
*PAR0:	but yeah he doesn't have a doll . 377760_379100
*PAR0:	&-um thinking maybe I should get him a doll . 379320_381220
*PAR0:	I don't know you know it's nothing wrong with getting a doll . 381560_385240
*PAR0:	he doesn't have to just be a girl but he seemed but he is definitely knows &-um he doesn't have siblings . 385400_391080
*PAR0:	&-um &-uh but he recently &-uh you know been doing little play dates here and there . 391580_397140
*PAR0:	and &-um it [/] it is f funny you know &-uh him noticing the other child . 397260_403500
*PAR0:	think at first the first time he seemed to be thinking he was like you know the image in the mirror . 404120_408800
*PAR0:	like is he looking at the mirror . 409080_410480
*PAR0:	is he looking not that he knows the mirror so you know but because it was just the way he was reacting to that other child you know sort of what he does in the mirror . 410580_419120
*PAR0:	so I think initially when I brought you know this in front of put this in front of him a little play date . 419560_424280
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah like a play date or is it again like the mirror because he looks in the mirror every day several times a day . 424280_430800
*PAR0:	and &-uh when &-uh we do bath time and a little Aidan yeah [/] yeah . 431500_435280
*PAR0:	so he definitely this was &-uh definitely curiosity for sure . 435600_438940
*PAR0:	so . 439280_440100
*PAR0:	yeah it'll be interesting to see what he plays with when he comes back . 440100_443980
*PAR0:	yeah . 443980_444560
*PAR0:	as he's a little older right . 444560_445920
*PAR0:	yeah Exc exc [/] exc [/] exc [/] exc preference because I think right now I don't it's hard to say a preference . 445920_449880
*PAR0:	he was interested in everything that was put in front of him . 449880_453200
*PAR0:	you know he like <I was> [/] I was doing art to me . 453200_456620
*PAR0:	this was new again these toys with the food . 456620_458480
*PAR0:	so decided . 458480_459460
*PAR0:	okay . 459460_459940
*PAR0:	because this is me . 459940_460640
*PAR0:	I'm an adult . 460640_461480
*PAR0:	let's put the food on the plate . 461480_462900
*PAR0:	and see . 462900_463260
*PAR0:	oh I mean I'm doing that at home now with him and food . 463260_466600
*PAR0:	so I thought I would do that . 466600_468240
*PAR0:	not that he doesn't eat . 468240_469720
*PAR0:	he doesn't eat these kinds of foods yet . 469720_471560
*PAR0:	but &-uh but we do I am trying to put things on plates . 471560_475100
*PAR0:	&-um so yeah so it was interesting to see him you know . 475100_479740
*PAR0:	then pick it up . 479740_480420
*PAR0:	maybe if I'd just put on the fly he would have picked it up anyway . 480860_482920
*PAR0:	but so we'll see if he then later on starts mimicking that or doing it . 483180_487860
*PAR0:	you know he'll be I would su I'll tell you that he has a lot of stacking toys at home . 487860_492180
*PAR0:	and I noticed you didn't have that here . 492260_493640
*PAR0:	&-um he likes to stack &-uh what kinds of stacking toys does he have like you know the Fisher that's the classics . 494100_501080
*PAR0:	they've had him I think since back you know for our own parents &-um you know it's [/] it's [/] it's the stacking rings that goes on . 501100_509300
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah he [/] he pulls them off and he'll put them on . 509480_512120
*PAR0:	&-um he does <with the> [/] with the when I say stacking the little &-um different shapes that go inside buckets . 512740_520420
*PAR0:	now he hasn't quite figured it all out . 520920_522980
*PAR0:	he knows certainly how to take them all out . 523140_524600
*PAR0:	that's for sure mean like the little sorters yes the sorters . 524700_527660
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah . 527940_528520
*PAR0:	mhm . 528660_528780
*PAR0:	and he definitely plays with that . 529040_530780
*PAR0:	okay . 530880_531840
*PAR0:	can see the hair . 531840_532380
*PAR0:	but I mean no [/] no not a criticism something like that's what he he's definitely familiar go for &-uh huh . 532380_537840
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 538080_538920
*PAR0:	but I mean he right does he do anything with like stacking cups . 539260_542120
*PAR0:	does he have those kinds of things . 542160_543300
*PAR0:	oh I haven't &-uh cut cups . 543320_545460
*PAR0:	I like it . 545700_546040
*PAR0:	I'm perhaps stacking cups . 546040_547320
*PAR0:	yeah I don't have them here but I know you what I mean I [/] I think I remember them . 547340_551060

*PAR0:	yep . 552640_552860
*PAR0:	yep . 552860_553100
*PAR0:	&-um I don't have one of those . 553440_554840
*PAR0:	but I'm sure I'm he would probably like it . 554840_556980
*PAR0:	yeah . 557000_557200
*PAR0:	he's definitely that you know . 557200_559380
*PAR0:	yeah he's at that stage I think that's a stage . 559460_562020
*PAR0:	yeah . 562140_562320
*PAR0:	but &-um &-uh he's &-um he's [/] he's a curious kid . 562320_565920
*PAR0:	so anything I can tell . 566140_568380
*PAR0:	yeah he is he was interested in all of it pretty much he was but it was as I said . 568560_574260
*PAR0:	definitely there were certain things that was new . 574260_576240
*PAR0:	so he grabbed &-um yeah things that are colorful for sure . 576240_582000
*PAR0:	I see that's why it was funny . 582380_583140
*PAR0:	when I &-um I knew he'd go for that frog . 583140_585380
*PAR0:	I just had a feeling you know the yellow the green . 585560_587820
*PAR0:	do you think there are colors that he responds to more than others . 588220_591960
*PAR0:	just &-um I'd say definitely bright [/] bright colors . 591980_595920
*PAR0:	so whether I mean here [/] here it was yellow . 595920_598300
*PAR0:	mean I think if he had something that was you know bright orange or even the you know well there was something in the red . 598300_604220
*PAR0:	I mean he [/] he [/] he maybe this is just my I think he seems to respond to colors I don't know especially bright colors . 604220_612180
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah I know . 612180_613580
*PAR0:	&-um yeah when I put him I'm trying to get him some of the more colorful toys . 613580_619740
*PAR0:	so that he has some more plush toys . 619740_621640
*PAR0:	mhm that he has with the same color . 621640_623080
*PAR0:	I &-uh well that just could be his mom thinking he's doing that . 623080_626380
