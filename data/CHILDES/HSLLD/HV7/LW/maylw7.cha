@Comment:	Time is 0:05
@Comment:	MOT and Chi briefly review the story in the beginning , and Chi gets it mixed up , thinking the butterfly turns into a caterpillar , resulting in lots_of laughter. Mot doesn't want the letter to be too bland , just <I think your book is great>. Chi thinks of writing him! a story but Mot and EXP nix the idea. Chi sometimes asks Mot for both ideas and spellings throughout the letter. Mot prompts and provides Chi with words , sentences , and spellings. A lot of interaction and laughter between Chi and Mot. Mot encouraged Chi and was generally very patient with her. Minimal interaction by EXP.
