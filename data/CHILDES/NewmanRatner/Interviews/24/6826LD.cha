*PAR0:	you wanna go for a walk . 0_1260
*PAR0:	you wanna go outside the hall . 1260_4260
*PAR0:	it's okay . 4260_5380
*PAR0:	you see the water fountain up there . 5380_7240
*PAR0:	you should go look at the water fountain . 7240_9920
*PAR0:	you sound good . 9920_11480
*PAR0:	now he's like . 11480_13320
*PAR0:	I don't know what I just committed to . 13320_15380
*PAR0:	yeah that's fine . 15380_17560
*PAR0:	&-um okay . 17560_18180
*PAR0:	so what was he really interested in . 18180_20160
*PAR0:	today it looked like it was more like the kitchen and houseware items . 20160_24040
*PAR0:	mhm . 24040_24800
*PAR0:	he's not been exposed to dolls because he has an older brother . 24800_28180
*PAR0:	and so that's probably why he didn't have any interest in the doll . 28180_31520
*PAR0:	it didn't even like when I went to him he was like . 31520_33340
*PAR0:	no . 33340_33840
*PAR0:	&-um so [/] so he's never really played with them at all . 33840_38300
*PAR0:	I mean he's stuffed animals but not actual dolls . 38300_41560
*PAR0:	I think that's part of the reason why he was probably reluctant and didn't seem to be too interested . 41560_46620
*PAR0:	yeah . 46620_47180
*PAR0:	so what were some of the things you were trying to get him to do with the doll . 47180_49580
*PAR0:	so he wasn't just hold it . 49580_51560
*PAR0:	he was like . 51660_52080
*PAR0:	no I didn't I s he said . 52080_53900
*PAR0:	no right away . 53900_54580
*PAR0:	said . 54940_55120
*PAR0:	do you wanna rock it like a baby . 55120_56080
*PAR0:	no . 56180_56400
*PAR0:	he tried to help me put the boot on . 57160_59440
*PAR0:	but that was about the extent of it . 59440_61780
*PAR0:	&-um so what kind of things was he doing with the food . 61780_66780
*PAR0:	he seemed to pretend to cook a lot . 66780_68600
*PAR0:	&-um put the pot on the stove . 68600_70600
*PAR0:	&-um he loved playing with the muffins . 71660_73940
*PAR0:	and I don't know if it was because it was kinda like a puzzle and putting the pieces back in . 73980_78420
*PAR0:	but every time he dropped it he would try to put them back together . 78740_80760
*PAR0:	he was really obsessed about the muffins . 81940_83560
*PAR0:	mhm . 83700_83900
*PAR0:	&-um is food something he plays with at home at all . 85000_87620
*PAR0:	we have some play kitchen stuff that he got from his &-um older cousin . 87660_91020
*PAR0:	but &-um it's very &-um generic . 91960_94780
*PAR0:	it's nothing like what you have here . 94880_96120
*PAR0:	so it's just like pieces of toast and like a pizza and some pieces of fruit . 96220_100100
*PAR0:	so probably liked that it was something different to play with . 100240_103740
*PAR0:	but he does play with that kind of stuff a lot at home . 103800_105660
*PAR0:	okay . 105920_106220
*PAR0:	&-um so were any of the foods were they familiar foods for him that <he saw> [/] he saw the banana . 106980_113100
*PAR0:	and he noticed that &-um he seemed to recognize the green beans but wouldn't tell me what they were . 113420_118680
*PAR0:	mhm . 118900_119260
*PAR0:	so I was trying to get him to talk to me about the foods . 119660_122080
*PAR0:	but he didn't seem to be too interested in talking about them just playing . 122120_126460
*PAR0:	&-um were there any foods that were new to him that he might never have seen before . 126880_130940
*PAR0:	&-um he might not seen like this cut of meat like the rib or the whatever that is chop . 131300_138620
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know lamb chop . 139080_140840
*PAR0:	don't know he didn't but he didn't seem to be too interested either way in it . 140980_145380
*PAR0:	yeah . 145760_146180
*PAR0:	&-um that was about it . 147540_149440
*PAR0:	he most of the stuff . 149600_151180
*PAR0:	he most of the time he had held onto the muffins or the he played with the cheese a little bit . 151180_155920
*PAR0:	mm . 156160_156180
*PAR0:	hm . 156180_156320
*PAR0:	he recognized what the juice was . 156560_158180
*PAR0:	mm . 158480_158600
*PAR0:	hm &-um I can't think of anything else . 158600_164460
*PAR0:	he just was really obsessed about those few little things the whole time . 164660_167800
*PAR0:	yeah . 167820_168300
*PAR0:	&-um not much about the animals either . 169180_171780
*PAR0:	yeah . 172120_172380
*PAR0:	he was a little bit towards the end . 172700_174540
*PAR0:	were there any animals that he had seen . 174600_176220
*PAR0:	were they animals he had seen before . 176220_177440
*PAR0:	&-um I think so because I pulled out a cat and some other things that might be familiar to him . 177960_183880
*PAR0:	&-um but he didn't . 184980_185860
*PAR0:	and he noticed things that would make a loud noise which was funny . 185860_188800
*PAR0:	he'd always pick something that would make r [/] r sound or something like that . 189320_193720
*PAR0:	but &-um he didn't actually name a lot of them right out of the box . 193740_197140
*PAR0:	okay . 197320_197520
*PAR0:	&-uh does he play with animals a lot . 198420_200140
*PAR0:	is that &-um not too much . 200280_202620
*PAR0:	okay . 203220_203580
*PAR0:	&-um were any of the animals new ones that he hadn't seen before . 204500_207560
*PAR0:	yeah <I'm sure> [/] I'm sure he hasn't actually seen a peacock before or a lobster . 208500_213240
*PAR0:	so I'm sure those are definitely new to him . 213240_217700
*PAR0:	and does he look at books with animals anything like that . 217700_225080
*PAR0:	yeah I were trying to steer more towards those kind of things . 225080_228720
*PAR0:	and just the baby books like &-um get more like animals in there . 228720_232940
*PAR0:	and he does watch a lot of tv with his older sibling . 233160_236060
*PAR0:	and like those science shows . 236060_237840
*PAR0:	and they talk about animals a lot . 238000_239840
*PAR0:	so I'm sure he's getting it . 239940_241620
*PAR0:	but he's just not really talking about it much . 241620_243200
*PAR0:	he likes making the noises I guess . 243480_245160
*PAR0:	yeah like he loves dinosaurs . 245160_247000
*PAR0:	&-uh because his brother has a bunch of dinosaurs . 247280_248900
*PAR0:	he plays with &-um let's see . 248900_252040
*PAR0:	does he play with anything else . 252040_253300
*PAR0:	or he didn't even make his way this way at all . 253300_255780
*PAR0:	and so yeah he pretty much stayed on that . 255940_259240
*PAR0:	end . 259240_259500
*PAR0:	okay . 259940_260200
*PAR0:	did you notice anything about his play today that was different from what either he normally does or different from what he had done in previous play sessions . 260620_268040
*PAR0:	well this time he was definitely more active in the play session before I had to really encourage him to do things or to engage him right where now at this age he definitely can do it more himself . 268760_280480
*PAR0:	&-um I just think because &-um he's able to figure things out himself more . 280480_285980
*PAR0:	he seemed to enjoy trying . 285980_287840
*PAR0:	and he doesn't have like a pretend stove top . 288100_290300
*PAR0:	so that probably was interesting to him . 290300_291960
*PAR0:	so the difference in toys probably made it . 291960_295700
*PAR0:	yeah . 295700_297340
*PAR0:	and does he &-um when he plays at home does he usually I mean does he really gravitate towards food . 297340_303920
*PAR0:	is he pretty directed at something . 303920_306780
*PAR0:	and then it's funny because at home we he have so many more like cars and just other boy toys . 306780_313220
*PAR0:	that &-um I mean we do have a few of the kitchen things . 313220_316720
*PAR0:	and he will play with them on occasion . 316720_318140
*PAR0:	but &-um this is the first I've ever really seen him play longer periods a lot of times . 318420_324460
*PAR0:	I walk in our playroom and he's sitting in front of the bookshelf just opening books and playing with them or running a car around the room . 324460_330820
*PAR0:	so you ready to eat . 330820_333380
*PAR0:	yeah . 335140_335220
*PAR0:	I think you can get something like that on the way out we'll get a bagel not a donut . 335220_339200
*PAR0:	and yeah I think if we had cars or you know balls or like real boy toys they'd be going all over the . 339200_347420
*PAR0:	yeah I think that would . 347420_348580
*PAR0:	be it yeah different story but really nice . 348580_350840
*PAR0:	&-um and did you notice anything today . 351260_353000
*PAR0:	just during the whole session that you wanted to bring up anything . 353000_357420
*PAR0:	you were concerned about anything . 357420_358580
*PAR0:	well he actually just had his recent two year checkup . 359140_362440
*PAR0:	and the Pete pediatrician's a little concerned about his speech . 362440_365960
*PAR0:	&-um but I think a lot of it is because he's a second sibling . 365960_370480
*PAR0:	I probably don't take the attention that I used to with the first one . 370480_373500
*PAR0:	like . 373500_373640
*PAR0:	here's your cup . 373640_374440
*PAR0:	and you know right . 374440_375420
*PAR0:	so &-um we're just we're gonna be more aware of that and try to make him more . 375540_380660
*PAR0:	what did you find a muffin . 380920_382500
*PAR0:	yeah . 382500_384120
*PAR0:	so we're just gonna try to remember that you know to be a little more &-um articulate about what we do with him so that he'll pick up stuff more . 384120_395240
*PAR0:	okay . 395240_396000
*PAR0:	and we are gonna have an evaluation done just to make sure through the infants and toddlers . 396000_400180
*PAR0:	yeah I called yesterday . 400180_401160
*PAR0:	and he's waiting for a call back for an appointment . 401160_403280
*PAR0:	okay . 403280_403720
*PAR0:	because his brother at this age was talking sentences . 403720_407540
*PAR0:	but he was in a daycare setting with some older kids at that point . 407540_412020
*PAR0:	and &-uh being the first one I guess we talked our ears off to him . 412020_415680
*PAR0:	we're now are like . 415680_416180
*PAR0:	no I'm just kidding . 416180_417620
*PAR0:	and it's not . 417620_418480
*PAR0:	and I remember being I was the older sibling . 418480_420480
*PAR0:	I talked for my younger sibling a lot . 420480_422780
*PAR0:	so my poor brother didn't talk until he was like three . 422780_425080
*PAR0:	yeah so yeah &-um and we will &-um we did do a number of standardized tests today . 425080_432420
*PAR0:	so we'll &-um also send you a letter with the results from that . 432580_436120
*PAR0:	okay . 436260_436480
*PAR0:	&-um do you know . 437120_437520
*PAR0:	did you say you don't know when he's having the evaluation . 437520_440040
*PAR0:	&-um I got a message that they're trying to make the appointment . 440600_443160
*PAR0:	so I'm trying to get back in touch with them . 443160_445140
*PAR0:	but it's in the works to start the appointment . 445140_447040
*PAR0:	&-um so I'm hoping to get something soon . 447040_449900
*PAR0:	okay . 450200_450440
*PAR0:	&-um and we usually try to get the letter out within six weeks or so . 450940_454460
*PAR0:	but &-um we'll &-uh yeah we'll [/] we'll look at all the tests . 454460_458460
*PAR0:	and &-um yeah it is good to you know if [/] if you are a little concerned getting the evaluation will be good because he was talking but sometimes it was hard to understand him . 458460_469300
*PAR0:	yeah . 469480_469700
*PAR0:	and &-um but he was engaged . 469900_472240
*PAR0:	so it wasn't you know I thought <he did> [/] he did pretty well today . 472240_475880
*PAR0:	so &-um I have to admit he does a lot of his own solitary play . 476040_481240
*PAR0:	so he is like he'll be fine if we just left him in a corner . 481240_484600
*PAR0:	and he could play . 484600_485300
*PAR0:	it's funny . 485300_486420
*PAR0:	all righty . 486420_489120
*PAR0:	you ready to put the toys away . 489120_490440
*PAR0:	&-um actually I have &-um just two consent forms to go over with you real . 490440_493860
*PAR0:	okay . 493860_494340
*PAR0:	and then we'll let him get his prize . 494340_496220
*PAR0:	and then we'll be all done . 496220_498400
*PAR0:	Lou don't lick the lamb chop . 498460_499600
*PAR0:	no it doesn't taste good . 500240_504080
*PAR0:	huh it doesn't taste too good . 504080_507900
*PAR0:	okay . 508320_509580
*PAR0:	yeah those all look pretty familiar . 510320_513900
*PAR0:	he's between him and his brother . 514400_517320
*PAR0:	he probably done these like twenty times now . 517320_518820
*PAR0:	oh yeah [/] yeah . 518820_519940
*PAR0:	alright so I can &-um since we are at the &-uh let me get your keyboard . 519940_528080
*PAR0:	did you finish filling these out . 528080_529160
*PAR0:	yes I did . 529160_529700
*PAR0:	okay . 529700_529840
*PAR0:	so I'm just gonna grab those and I can explain . 529840_534380
*PAR0:	these to you real quickly . 534380_535800
*PAR0:	&-um since we are at the end of this study we can explain a little bit more what we were looking at . 535800_541960
*PAR0:	you know more depth . 541960_544040
*PAR0:	so basically this explains that we've been recording Luke's speech from seven months until now . 544040_550780
*PAR0:	but we've also been recording samples of your speech . 550780_553700
*PAR0:	and so we already have these recorded . 553700_556760
*PAR0:	but this is just giving us permission to go back and analyze it . 556760_559980
*PAR0:	okay . 559980_560220
*PAR0:	so some of the things we're looking for are your speaking rate . 560220_564660
*PAR0:	how carefully you pronounce new words . 564660_568400
*PAR0:	just length of your sentences . 568400_570000
*PAR0:	and just really comparing it to kind of when you're talking to him and then when you talk to an adult . 570000_576820
*PAR0:	so &-um one of the things we're looking at is really the sound of the vowels when you're talking to you know Lou versus &-uh an adult . 577220_585300
*PAR0:	so . 585540_585600
*PAR0:	okay . 585600_585880
*PAR0:	&-um so this is just going back &-uh just giving us permission to go ahead and analyze that . 586160_591440
*PAR0:	and we didn't explain this [/] this in the beginning because we didn't want you to feel self-conscious or you know no that makes sense as natural as possible . 591540_598420
*PAR0:	yeah exactly . 598420_599020
*PAR0:	so &-um this one we just need initial date up here . 599020_602580
*PAR0:	okay . 602580_603040
*PAR0:	and here and then your signature down here . 603040_606360
*PAR0:	okay . 606360_606780
*PAR0:	&-um I see . 606780_610320
*PAR0:	and then the additional consent form . 610320_612880
*PAR0:	this is a voluntary part of the study . 612880_615200
*PAR0:	it's really not attached to this particular study . 615200_618120
*PAR0:	okay . 618120_618540
*PAR0:	but what it is it explains that researchers are putting together an international database of child and parent language . 618540_627120
*PAR0:	so what we'd like to be able to do is contribute to that international database . 627120_633120
*PAR0:	okay . 633120_633460
*PAR0:	and as I've said it's entirely voluntary . 633460_635520
*PAR0:	and it comes in three options . 635520_638240
*PAR0:	so you can choose . 638240_640060
*PAR0:	I do not want any of my data or my child's data to be made available to other language researchers . 640060_644080
*PAR0:	meaning it would just be available to us here at University of Maryland for this study . 644080_648160
*PAR0:	okay . 648160_648420
*PAR0:	the next one is allowing anonymous transcripts and test score data . 649140_652300
*PAR0:	so that would be someone here would listen to it . 652300_654420
*PAR0:	do a written transcription . 654420_656000
*PAR0:	&-um and upload that . 656000_657480
*PAR0:	&-um and then the third option is allowing anonymous audio recordings . 657480_662200
*PAR0:	&-um so the real benefit of the audio recordings is when we listen we're listening for very specific things . 662200_668040
*PAR0:	we can capture that in our transcription . 668040_669840
*PAR0:	but we might leave out something that we can't really capture because we're not listening for it that another researcher &-um wants [/] wants to look at &-um so like I said &-um any of those three you can pick and sign this . 669840_683100
*PAR0:	&-um and like I did I think I said &-um any identifying information will be removed . 683100_688060
*PAR0:	okay . 688060_688440
