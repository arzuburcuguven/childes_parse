*PAR1:	and she's also that girl . 605265_606845
*PAR1:	and Ross are gonna be good at resisting cold . 606905_609525
*PAR1:	okay . 610275_610565
*PAR1:	and they'll have little babies who can also resist the cold . 610865_613485
*PAR0:	see I'm sure they'll be he'll find enough . 613585_616685

*PAR1:	so do you understand now how they can find . 623635_625535
*PAR1:	and then all those babies are gonna be able to resist . 625595_627175
*PAR1:	the . 627175_627335
*PAR1:	okay . 627685_627975
*PAR1:	yeah . 628005_628295
*PAR0:	simple . 628675_629095
*PAR1:	now how did Darwin figure this out . 629355_630815
*PAR1:	let's see what how Darwin figured this out . 631065_632855
*PAR1:	okay . 632965_633255
*PAR1:	so he found these bones . 633795_635895
*PAR1:	okay . 636165_636455
*PAR1:	first of all his daddy Darwin's daddy . 636665_639575
*PAR0:	daddy . 640785_641135
*PAR1:	&-um and his grandpa was a very [/] very smart man . 641635_645295
*PAR1:	a physician naturalist . 646535_647855
*PAR1:	and he thought . 648595_649455
*PAR0:	maybe . 650225_650575
*PAR1:	okay . 650845_651135
*PAR1:	in the old days . 651155_651895
*PAR1:	do you know that they didn't believe in Oli did you know that . 652195_654535
*PAR0:	they didn't believe in . 655365_656215
*PAR1:	it before Darwin they did not . 656215_657575
*PAR0:	believe in Oli what did they believe . 657575_659215
*PAR1:	what did they believe in . 660165_660935
*PAR0:	god . 661195_661415
*PAR1:	god . 662395_662615
*PAR1:	what does it say in the bible . 662725_663655
*PAR0:	God created everything . 666035_667855
*PAR1:	how many days did it take . 668115_669095
*PAR0:	about seven . 670225_673005
*PAR1:	yeah . 673235_673525
*PAR1:	six days . 673905_674325
*PAR1:	and he rested on the sixth on the seventh day . 674325_676285
*PAR1:	right . 676295_676645
*PAR1:	yeah . 676955_677245
*PAR1:	okay . 677475_677765
*PAR1:	so it didn't take like millions of years right [/] right [/] right . 678185_682925
*PAR1:	so when Darwin said it just . 683145_684645
*PAR0:	went boom [/] boom . 684645_686165
*PAR1:	right . 686455_686805
*PAR1:	so when Darwin said it took millions and millions of years to get like this . 686805_689965
*PAR1:	how do you think people felt about that . 690265_691565
*PAR1:	okay . 695475_695765
*PAR1:	now &-um let's now there was another guy called Lamar do you know about Lamar think . 696545_704605
*PAR0:	you think . 704605_705005
*PAR1:	think Lamar had a different theory . 705005_706365
*PAR1:	do you want me to tell you about Lamar's theory . 706365_707685
*PAR1:	can I read this to you . 707745_708525
*PAR0:	why don't I just read myself huh . 709025_710685
*PAR1:	this is interesting . 710715_711485
*PAR1:	let me read it . 711485_711925
*PAR1:	okay . 711925_712125
*PAR1:	okay . 712155_712445
*PAR1:	Lamar liked to refer to a Giraffe because its long necks seemed to be so . 712695_716445
*PAR1:	odd . 716505_716725
*PAR1:	okay . 716955_717245
*PAR1:	he said that [/] that the giraffe may have grown from an animal much like an antelope . 717585_721405
*PAR1:	then at some point he began to eat the leaves of trees in order to do this . 721875_725285
*PAR1:	it had to stretch its neck . 725285_726325
*PAR1:	at first these parts that body was stretched just a little in the longer neck . 727305_731405
*PAR1:	tongue and legs were passed on to its offspring . 731525_734045
*PAR1:	see . 734105_734325
*PAR1:	and every time they grew up they got their necks longer and longer . 734545_737365
*PAR1:	do you believe that . 737385_738045
*PAR1:	okay . 739195_739485
*PAR1:	then what would Darwin say instead of that . 739485_741085
*PAR0:	they just grew because I mean <it's like> [/] it's like the same as humans . 743975_748865
*PAR0:	basketball players were would be considered tall when and my teachers in the old in the days when you were little the &-um people your size right now would consider you a tall person . 750235_768385
*PAR1:	yeah . 769055_769345
*PAR1:	but what about the draft . 769345_770265
*PAR0:	and [/] and . 770285_770745
*PAR1:	and what about the draft . 771045_772105
*PAR0:	they keep on . 772255_772905
*PAR0:	<it's like> [/] it's like a tall person . 772935_774665
*PAR0:	and it's like a per you would be &-um in real [/] real [/] real old days . 776645_783945
*PAR0:	you would be considered practically a giant . 784245_786705
*PAR1:	sure . 787615_787905
*PAR1:	but wait a second . 788045_788785
*PAR1:	let's talk about the giraffes . 788955_790145
*PAR1:	how did the giraff get their long neck . 790645_792225
*PAR0:	&-uh . 794485_794705
*PAR1:	did he keep on stretching to reach the leaves . 795645_797465
*PAR1:	what did Darwin say . 799125_800175
*PAR1:	I don't know . 801635_802115
*PAR1:	Darwin says that only the animals that had long necks survived because the trees kept on getting higher and higher . 802215_808635
*PAR1:	okay . 810735_811025
*PAR1:	and the longer you got a neck the and if you had little babies that didn't have long necks you couldn't reach the leaves . 812915_818715
*PAR1:	only <the piggy> [/] the piggy your ass that [/] that ate the leaves up with the long necks . 818785_823875
*PAR1:	would he get all the food . 823875_824715
*PAR1:	and the ones that had short necks would die . 824715_826155
*PAR0:	why didn't what . 827855_829075
*PAR0:	wait dad . 829075_829675
*PAR0:	why didn't the &-uh . 830175_831155
*PAR1:	see they bite all the books . 831335_832315
*PAR0:	off the . 832315_832675
*PAR0:	why didn't the long necked mhm . 832695_834515
*PAR0:	parrot give food to their little neck to babies . 834775_839395
*PAR1:	because the giraffes don't help their babies like that . 839745_841995
*PAR1:	they're not nice to the babies like that . 842385_844195
*PAR1:	oh they might help them a little bit . 844695_846035
*PAR1:	but <when they> [/] when they get older they still have to . 846535_848755
*PAR1:	and they [/] they the giraffes work on their own . 848775_851115
*PAR1:	they don't work in [/] in families . 851115_852595
*PAR1:	okay . 853955_854245
*PAR1:	okay . 854675_854965
*PAR1:	do you understand now . 855025_855885
*PAR1:	yeah . 856075_856365
*PAR1:	okay . 856515_856805
*PAR1:	so it wasn't that they stretched . 856945_858405
*PAR1:	<it's that> [/] it's that the ones that didn't [/] didn't have long necks died . 858595_861485
*PAR1:	and now they kept on families . 861625_863805
*PAR0:	and that made us to believe that they stretched because all of them had own necks . 863805_868845
*PAR1:	right . 869335_869685
*PAR0:	all of the ones that lived . 870265_871605
*PAR0:	and we only saw the ones that lived . 872065_873765
*PAR1:	right . 874295_874645
*PAR1:	mhm . 874785_875205
*PAR1:	okay . 876875_877165
*PAR1:	now one now are we ready for the next thing . 877265_880205
*PAR1:	yeah . 880355_880645
*PAR1:	okay . 880645_880805
*PAR1:	now this is where the Beagle went . 881145_883085
*PAR1:	this one of the places that the Vigo went is through the Gala Galapagos Islands aren't they strange looking weird . 883085_888485
*PAR1:	this is the Galapagos Island trees . 888635_890525
*PAR1:	there lots of little islands . 890525_891885
*PAR1:	there's Narre Almar Barrington Chatham trees . 891885_895645
*PAR1:	okay . 895755_896045
*PAR1:	would you like to go visit the Phil Island sometimes . 896135_898245
*PAR0:	it would be no way . 898705_899565
*PAR0:	the trees were ugly . 899585_900485
*PAR1:	okay . 901555_901845
*PAR1:	now Darwin studied all these little birds . 901845_904005
*PAR0:	different . 904835_905445
*PAR1:	types of fins boots different . 905445_907405
*PAR1:	and he asked himself . 908345_909405
*PAR1:	why are all these little birds all different . 910065_912565
*PAR1:	what do you think . 912915_913525
*PAR1:	why are they all different . 913665_914565
*PAR0:	they're different species . 914675_915925
*PAR0:	yeah . 917315_917605
*PAR0:	yes . 918025_918245
*PAR0:	you know this now . 918425_919205
*PAR1:	every little island had its own species . 920495_922805
*PAR1:	okay . 923635_923925
*PAR0:	cool man . 924555_925125
*PAR0:	no . 925505_925725
*PAR0:	and . 925745_925965
*PAR1:	that was because [/] because <they could not> [/] they could not bleed together because the birds . 926315_931445
*PAR0:	couldn't breathe . 931445_931885

*PAR1:	all the children went to different islands . 989225_990765
*PAR1:	and they lit they got slightly different by evolution . 990765_993045
*PAR0:	this is the small . 993275_994245
*PAR0:	this is the small . 994955_996045

*PAR0:	is the . 997485_997725
*PAR1:	small in the old days . 997725_998525
*PAR1:	Darwin went down . 998705_999485
*PAR1:	he dug into the fossils . 999485_1000965
*PAR1:	he found the old days . 1000965_1002045
*PAR1:	there was only one type of finch in the Galapagos isn't . 1002375_1005245

*PAR5:	well when . 2136825_2137365
*PAR5:	well . 2137995_2138285

*PAR0:	mhm . 2148265_2148685
*PAR0:	sort of like eat up the bad sauce . 2148765_2150325
*PAR0:	and they use the bad sauce as good sauce . 2151505_2154325
*PAR0:	they change the bad cells and used the bad cells as good cells . 2154635_2158405
*PAR0:	hmm . 2158925_2159045
*PAR5:	then [/] then you have more good cells in your body than bad cells . 2160875_2163805
*PAR5:	right . 2164295_2164645
*PAR5:	well I see . 2165355_2166005
*PAR0:	so being sick can is sometimes the [/] the [/] the little thing the little don't know this . 2166945_2173485
*PAR0:	but being sick can sometimes help you right after [/] after you've been sick it can sometimes help you . 2173625_2182845
*PAR5:	well I know that when you are sick after you've been sick you because you were fighting those bad germs . 2183835_2192765
*PAR5:	then your body has a new way of fighting them . 2193355_2198125
*PAR0:	what does that mean . 2198835_2199525
*PAR5:	well I guess sort of like what you were saying . 2200795_2202805
*PAR5:	they develop they get good at fighting that particular germ . 2202805_2208845
*PAR5:	at first the germ takes them by surprise . 2209865_2212165
*PAR5:	and they say . 2213185_2213765
*PAR5:	oh my god we better get busy and fight . 2213785_2217125
*PAR5:	but they have to learn a new way of fighting . 2218105_2220045
*PAR5:	and so they do . 2222105_2222885
*PAR5:	and then the next time that germ comes along to <your body> [/] your body knows how to fight that germ . 2224665_2230565
*PAR5:	and it's pretty good at it . 2231425_2232605
*PAR5:	and it fights really hard . 2232605_2233765
*PAR5:	and it's strong . 2233785_2234565
*PAR5:	and it won't let you get sick that way again . 2234585_2236845
*PAR5:	but if a new germ comes along and it's never fought that new germ . 2237625_2241325
*PAR5:	it's got to learn how to fight the new one . 2243165_2245415
*PAR0:	called . 2246435_2246855
*PAR5:	antibodies . 2246855_2247495
*PAR5:	it builds up antibodies in certain . 2247635_2249615
*PAR0:	there's . 2250085_2250575
*PAR5:	a there's this . 2250615_2252335
*PAR0:	&-um there's this little &-um piece of your body . 2252395_2255935
*PAR0:	&-um like sort of your guts or something . 2256235_2258735
*PAR0:	I forget what it is . 2258895_2259775
*PAR0:	but it's there . 2260275_2262985
*PAR0:	and it bites off the germs . 2263205_2265585
*PAR0:	there's sort of a . 2266495_2267505
*PAR5:	some something . 2267505_2268185
*PAR0:	or one thing in your body that fights off the germs . 2268205_2271025
*PAR0:	and if the germs . 2271845_2273105
*PAR0:	and if the germs kill that one thing in your body then this other thing takes over . 2274045_2279465
*PAR0:	and then it fights the germs . 2279925_2281665
*PAR0:	and if they kill that thing then you [/] you just die . 2282525_2285465
*PAR5:	goodness . 2286665_2286825
*PAR5:	if I can't imagine what that would be . 2287005_2288785
*PAR0:	well actually I don't know if you die but you might die because [/] because the you would get an infected gown . 2290495_2297785
*PAR0:	and it just go it infects the whole body without anything fighting it . 2298125_2302585
*PAR0:	oh so there's two things that fight the bad &-um self . 2302965_2309915
*PAR5:	bad germs . 2311975_2312675
*PAR0:	yeah . 2312905_2313195
*PAR0:	germs . 2313835_2314075
*PAR5:	the blood cells that surround it . 2315825_2320045
*PAR0:	yeah . 2321315_2321605
