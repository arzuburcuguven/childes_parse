@Comment:	Chi's letter is written very neatly. She finished it quickly and easily. Chi included all of Mot's suggestions. She confirmed the spelling of favorite and beautiful. Mot gave her an incorrect spelling for sincerely , but helped when Chi had questions about punctuation. Mot also suggested that Chi include the date.
