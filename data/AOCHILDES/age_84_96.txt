and write a story
dear eric carle
from clara
i like the book you made the very hungry caterpillar
becuse it is so funny it is like the caterpillar is loving to death
do his or her mother know that him or her is doing this
well also can be just a regular old letter to him
if you wanna just write a letter to him asking him
so you can ask you know
well its a letter
how do you do a letter usually
ill give this to you
thats exactly what were thinking of doing
this taperecorder baby going
yes he is going
yeah dont you dont have
how is it
let me see
you did a nice job
just sat down and did it
dear eric carle i like the book you made the very hungry caterpillar because it is so funny and it is like the caterpillar is
starving to death
oh good
do his or her mother know that him or her is doing this
like he went through and ate all the things in the kitchen without -um without asking
thank you that was nice
good question
so do you need a surface to write on
dear eric carle i like your book the very hungry caterpillar
i like the nice colorful pictures especially the page with the colorful butterfly on it
but the best part i like is when he kept on eating and he got big and fat i never knew caterpillars can eat so much
from chi
let me get you something
will this help chi
a tv tray
if its not its okay
well what do you write in letters to people
its your letter you can say whatever you want
what do you think about the book chi
do you remember
lets first listen go over the pages so thatll refresh your mind
you havent seen this book for years huh chi
you enjoyed it so much
do you remember
wait a minute the last page
this is the author
who is it
youre writing the letter to him right
how do you start a letter
dear mister
blah his name
you might wanna read a little bit about the author
that gives you an idea how he wrote and then illustrated the book
lets see
hes known all around the world as an outstanding original artist and designer
he does all the designs right
theyre beautiful and colorful
born in the united states he spent some years in germany
hm what else
can we use all this information to help you chi
his first -uh childrens book were immediately successful and he now devotes his full full time to their writing and illustrating
you could ask him a question
you could just tell him something about the book
you could tell him something about yourself
oh he has two grown children and his -uh wife barbara live in massachusetts
he lives at the other end of the state
isnt that something
and and look his books have been translated into over a dozen languages
very interesting huh chi
im sure hell love that letter
i was in a toy store yesterday looking for christmas gifts and -um they have a very hungry caterpillar game out now
we we didnt make you play that though
like the hungry hippos only sort of
i was sort of like oh my god
ricky you wanna say hi -um
no he doesnt wanna say hi
i didnt realize how famous this book is and the author
over six million copies of his -um beloved book have been sold since then
it says -uh what is it illustration
translated into a dozen languages chi
wonder if they have it in spanish
probably a good -uh thing to look for huh
i mean you speak spanish right
understand it
so i started -uh talking to them in spanish for the last two three years
see that wasnt their primary language
so that makes it harder
and they dont listen to it
well you could -uh tell him why you like it
maybe because you are an artist too chi
like -um drawing and coloring
such a beautiful story huh
careful there
why do you have it spelled differently chi
easy to understand him no
dont you think
the ending
-uh i dont know what else can you say
you may even ask him write
tell him that you are learning spanish
you might wanna ask him if he is -uh selling his book in spanish too
there are so many things to say about this book chi
you got a lot down there
not only he got big and fat but what else
he developed into a beautiful butterfly
think the ending is the best part of it
well my opinion chi
they wanna hear from you
by the way talking about this book now i kept thinking you know because i lost a lot of my spanish l learning more english how do you say in spanish
how do you say in spanish
and i checked in the dictionary
its a funny word
what is it
not not spa
doesnt it sound funny huh
so it
very unusual w word in our language
and i was like wow
first time i ive seen that word in my lifetime
no one ever says it thats probably why
that is why chi
kind of cute his face
kind of funny looking huh
yeah with big eyes
like hes looking at you
yeah he looks a little scared
caught in the headlights
shes a writer
and a reader
she has this -uh great -uh teacher this year now
she -um encourages them and -uh really motivates to reading and writing
i can tell
shes a good teacher
so she has been doing a lot of that lately
anything else
why dont you sign it
now see chi dont you find his information interesting
how famous his book is and how many -um books that he published
thats it
thats usually how it goes on a letter but put it at the top if you want
so funny
that you never knew a caterpillar could eat so much
i would like to know where he gets all that stuff he eats
this -uh at the of the spring huh
went to a picnic for that one
not in winter yeah
thank you
thats a nice job
can you read it
you dont have to i can read it to myself
ill read it to myself
dont have to
thats really precious chi
i mean i know you can read it i guess i was waiting for you to read it out loud
giving yourself a break huh
good one
nice job
you may remember some of these things
we brought them to a visit a couple of visits back
but what wed like you guys to do is to play and talk with them for about ten minutes or so
so you guys can just play
i want that
is that nickel gonna stick to it black base
i didnt think so
what about these legos red flat legos
this magnet set is like the one at the doctors office huh
guest starring the cat
oh jeez
this is kinda kind of neat huh
oh look at that orange ball stuck to yellow wand
i thought that orange ball was a regular marble
its ball not a regular marble
how did you know
you remember
goes all the way down
hm thats paper clip staying on top of the silver stick what i wanted to do with the other one paper clip which slid down the silver stick
thats referent unclear weird
think we could hang him orange man from the top of the silver sticks
yes i can
gonna hang him orange man and then put it orange man hanging from the two sticks on the black base
get her cat out of there
now look
im gonna do it hang the orange man from the two silver sticks and then stand the sticks on the black base
put that flat silver circle back on the black base
wonder if that flat silver circle has something to do with that making objects stick to base
there you go
its standing the orange man on the silver sticks not gonna going to work
wheres something he orange man can stand on
there we go
hes orange man gonna fall
where are you
oh whoops
that putting silver man across the top of two silver sticks was a good idea
didnt work
these flat checkerboard square magnets
but theyre flat checkerboard type magnets like the ones we have on the refrigerator
this second silver stick or orange man one doesnt stay up there black base or top of the silver man does it
put him silver man up there underneath orange man
i orange man can stand on his silver man head
hes orange mans gonna fall
i feel him orange man falling
go get the glue
well glue his orange man hands to it two silver sticks
how about if you try chi
wait a minute
it looks like he orange man died
there you go
gotta stand now right
nice job
i knew it chi could make the orange man stand on its own
your mechanical mind would figure that out
feel how these referent unclear fight
knocked him orange man over
made it washer sit down
how did you do that make the washer stop moving
chi look
feel them washers fighting
put it washer down like that next to the edge of the silver circle and base at a slant
it washer will not go down onto silver circle
can i put
nah i dont wanna
gonna fall
put him orange man over with the legos
hell orange man go to bed
hows that
cover him orange man up
pretty brave chi
if you lay it silver stick down
think its gonna stand now
why dont you put the nuts and the washers down here on the base and build the guys silver men up
oh just the washers
well chi i think im gonna knock it tower over
thought for sure go then
put these green triangle and purple star on the bottom on the base
hows that
its like some olympic structure
oh yeah
kind of like lint huh
cant get rid of it lint and magnets
move this black base
move your body a little bit
so she exp can see
im missing you
i was getting your thigh
oh thats chis new arrangement on the base interesting
a little cat fur
oh yeah
you got the guy silver man up on the two sticks
go ahead
start all over
i like the guy silver man standing on him on the two silver sticks
how did you do it get the guy to stand on the two sticks
oh look at that
oh here
do that make the silver man hold the two silver sticks again
what are you gonna do
very nice
what about two guys
thats not how i had it at all
go like this
make them silver men like theyre walking
see if we can put a washer on their silver man head
dont think so
oh i thought thats green triangle what you were gonna going to use
i dont know
i dont know if that star like standing up tall
little too far
i knew you were gonna do that try to put washers on silver stick
its raining washers
put everything on
another idea huh
oh neat
i just wrecked it half-arch made of nuts huh
i wanted to do that knock over half-arch
can do that with washers on one side
i dont know
will the washers do it form an arch
oh you dont need this flat silver circle on there black base
no washers are too skinny i think
can put two together
wouldnt that be neat if you could clean your toys up like that with a sweep of a wand
i know
just wave the magic wands
i like that idea with you having them nuts like this
yeah well
i dont want you to have that nut one
go ahead
looks like mickey mouse
heres another one nut
well it tower of nuts looks good
pretty tall
very good
pretty good
very nice

monday ill give you that book to take back
i dont know
she might have just given it to us because we order a lot
and it was an extra one or something you know
and she knew bro would like it
i think it probably belongs to somebody
you should see their library
david you know the old card catalogues things like they useta have
well theyre all on computer now
their card catalogue is on the computer
and theres no directions or anything on how to use the computer
severe problems
because it would say press help
you know it would come up on the screen press help so i pressed
and it said lesson one page one
and i found that made it advance
just to use the card catalogue computers like nine pages long
i wasnt gonna sit there and read all that
we just went looking
we found what we wanted huh
its real nice down there but they havent really
well you never were in the childrens room before
it was probably if you knocked all the walls out of here it was about this size
now theyve got that whole block where the library is
down in the basement is a childrens room
they havent got enough books to fill it up
you know theres like if you put it along the living room wall with shelves from floor to ceiling
thats all the nonfiction
this giant room for it and there wasnt anything there
the the library that we went to was a en ente enti entire state building
state building
i dont know why librarians are so strange
theyre all strange
hes not hogging it you can eat it
theres not that much there
i didnt give you a whole bunch
its not a telephone
well what happened to your telephone
bro got special treatment today
what is that
well if you wanna take a library book out linda does library time first thing in the morning right
and i told bro before i left make sure you get a library book today so you can have it for the weekend
but bro didnt do it
so at the end of the day i said you didnt get a library book
you know i didnt know that they hadta do it first thing in the morning
so i said well why dont you go pick one out real quick
and laurie said something they have to do it first thing in the morning
well linda was standing there and she said bro come over here can you keep a secret
and i said no ha
and -uh she said dont tell any of the other kids but go over there and very secretly pick out a book and you dont even have to sign it out
oh linda does it for him
she just keeps track of them because nobody
oops sorry
nobody brings them back
im getting it chi
just the books they have in the classroom
well they got another book at my school
they do
whats that one
mom guess what
what mom guess what
i felt bad that they sat in a line
you feel bad for who
i think the last ones in a line
oh i know laurie told me but lets see if its what laurie told me
the hen -um the dog had -um the cat
and guess what
do you know what laurie told me
she said bro is really in touch with his feelings isnt he
and i said
and she said because we were reading the little red hen and linda said how do you think the little red hen felt when nobody would help her
and bro said i bet she felt real sad and bad that nobody would help her
you didnt
well laurie told me you did
i dont know i dont know that story
oh i told lenny about that newspaper reporter
he he assured me he was quite busy and he only had two minutes you know
so i told him and he said oh gee i dont know
guess the answer
im gonna have doctor zoch about that
freedom of the press as far concerned
if its publicized how bad the schools are doing and theyre looking for donations
what babe
well there would go mr ariveno
no he -uh
thats it folks
thats all all thats left
did you eat your sandwich at school today or just your pie
yeah i was gonna say aha tricked you didnt have milk
you shouldve seen what the central kitchen sent for bros lunch today
we were all sitting there trying to figure out whether it was peanut butter on the bread because you couldnt tell
and guess what
it was peanut butter and orange juice
well i told linda
on bread
macaroni and
you leaving bro
well if mr ariveno wouldnt eat it mustve been pretty bad huh
linda said shed like to -um
she would like to buy the food outright
instead of using the money
you know how they contract with them
to give the centers the option of purchasing their own materials to make the lunches with
she said id rather see them eating sandwiches every day than this stuff
i mean the macaroni and cheese looked like it was albino it was so bad
i mean it was really
so she says they said that we could do breakfast however we wanted
but the lunch in order to meet the requirements of the federal government
-um why cant
to have a hot lunch you know
goes down to that high school at least every other week complaining about some
she showed me a roll of hamburgers she had and she said wed just rather have it bulk and prepare it ourselves so itd be hot
she showed me a roll of hamburger patties they sent her
there was so much grease in there that there was white all stuck to the plastic
you couldnt even see the meat
and the minute she opened it up there were like big chunks of fat sitting in the the patties
so linda said theyd like to do like oatmeal and stuff
so i told her id go over to the the bakery and arrange for her to pick up on tuesdays
to get some muffins and some regular bread
she said shed get like real peanut butter and jelly instead of that stuff that you cant identify
dont make sense
they pay three thousand dollars a year for their food in the high school
id like some of them eat it
want more milk
-um well linda was sitting there eating it
and she said
god ive been here too long it tastes good to me
but what gets me is its sposta be like the nutritious meal of the day for low income children that supposedly dont get fed balanced food at home
and theyre eating garbage
i told bro because he was looking at it and he went like this ew
to eat when we go home
because they they put that peanut butter on all the bread and make sandwiches out of it cut it in half and stuff it back into the bread loaf wrapper
because i went up and i said linda you want me to go get that stuff theres a a loaf of bread down there
she said they sent us bread
then she said oh no its probably that nut butter stuff that they use
who the kids
oh you mean the kids at your school dont know what theyre missing by eating
monday mini subs tuesday pizza wednesday hot dogs and beans thursday
see and the thing is
like i told you carole over at eds school
she said two thirds of the school have the free lunch meal tickets
and -uh you know giving them stuff like that theyre just throwing away taxpayerss money because i can guarantee that them kids toss that stuff
do the kids that have the lunch tickets have to buy their lunch
do they usually throw most of it away or just a little bit
throw up
well that meeting that we had with bill minny over that
right before i he resigned
lenny said hed like to see them lose that peanut butter stuff because what it is like government you know federal government peanut butter
thats like all mealy tasting
and they take that and mix jelly with it in a bread mixer up at the high school
they mix it all together so the kids dont drop it on the floor and like get it all stuck all over everything
and you cant even see the jelly
its way too much peanut butter in proportion to the jelly you know
the trash
no wait -uh youre losing me
i dont get it
yeah the little foil dishes
oh you see
you mean what the kids are done with and dont want he
i believe it looking at anthony
ew is right
who was saying the other day right
what he likes you
yeah its because he sees you with all the good snacks hes hes working on you and hoping one day youll fork over your
arent you sick of those yet
he eats other peoples leftovers
youre exaggerating
yeah but what dont the other kids say something

for your christmas party
mom theres twenty five people
i know
bro she cant expect you to buy a gift for every person in the class
you told me one person
either that or i can bring like a football in for everybody
i mean one that like everybody can use without anybodys permission like that
the kind that we have in school
what do you mean
to donate like to the classroom you did for everybody in the class
like a nerf turbo football
what an official one
i mean because these are all the girl things that they have
chi hows your tooth
a hula hoop
-um three jump ropes

the football in the christmas grab

mom she will not even let us spend two dollars on a gift for the christmas grab
she wants you to spend a dollar right

i know
just always took it for granted
deu meaning children
and deu meaning garden
oh yeah
i guess it is
no it wasnt he meant it to show he wants to help children grow
i i dont know maybe when he started kindergarten people were wary of him
maybe they were wary he was gonna plant their kids in the ground

and then after you have some more food id like to hear more of your day
we spent four hours in the edit room
and we got about another t three and a half minutes of finished tape done
four i know i
and i meant to time it
sorry i i didnt
so how much do we have done all together
oh i have to time it
its about thirteen and a half fourteen minutes done
we should time it id like to see what ive done if its okay at the end
so were somewhere between thirteen and fourteen minutes into the tape
have to time it to be positive
so id say that were probably gonna end up with a thirty minute story
thats what i thought all along
you think -um that right about that
im i dont know
we have a thirty minute master tape
well i told you i thought id be thirty minutes
yeah but a thirty minute master tape means that its about thirty two minutes
of actual running time on the tape
yes thats why its thirty two minutes
so that you have running time in and out of the piece
because you think about the story
im trying to think
more than halfway through the story
still -um the end part
when she wakes up and then theres the credits
next time we edit we can do the credits and put that onto a tape
put it all on to the end of tape seven
but thursday night youre coming with me straight from after school to
im working on a show
and mas going out with carol so youre gonna be at with me
carols gonna take me to dinner
and then im gonna go hear a poetry reading
thought you might find that kind of boring so
you going with rex trailor
its an old family joke chi
have you ever heard of rex trailor
ever see that guy he advertises
what does he advertise
the woman this morning we saw going to
she wanted to do an exercise show
and so she went to rex trailors company
and had rex trailor direct her first exercise video
if you know rex trailor youre really trying to hide
well she said that he was very nice
not extremely confident as a director
and charged too much
well hes a local celebrity
he useta have a kidss show when we were kids
he was a cowboy
he was on channel five
weve told you about this
and havent we seen davey and goliath
on five it was going to be on
hes never seen davey and goliath
hes never seen davey and goliath
i just do that for him
they had this little song
and all the kids would go
and itd be like a variety show
and thered be this guy whos sposta be mexican i guess
that was his side kick
and they would do like funny stuff and
and they would show cartoons and they had
they did on sunday
they would pretend
the kids would walk with him up to this little church in the hill
like a little new england church
white church on a hill and they would sit there
i remembering this wrong
they walked to a church in a hill
they didnt
they did
they did
and then they watched davey and goliath
the kids watched davey and goliath but they didnt
they would go to a cut away of rex trailor riding his horse goldie across a field to the chapel
the kids went to the church
the kids did not go to the church
well i was never on the show
so i cant say for certain
but i believe the kids went to the church
and he rode his horse
he rode his horse
i forgot that his horse was named goldie
and pablo walked the kids over
im completely fabricating this
its not true
i fibbed i he did
its a one set show right
not that big a studio
and this fake little western street
in this dingy little
i bet it didnt look like that on tv
it didnt look like that on tv
and theyre gonna march these kids from the studio okay
on a live show
up a new england hill
up a new england hill
the little white church
the little white church
it was very solemn
and then they hadta watch davey and goliath
it always had a moral to the story
gee davey
what was goliath
goliath was a dog
a dog
remember what goliath was
and shes gonna argue with me about this
hes not a cartoon
it was animated
it was what dear
but it wasnt a cartoon
is that what they were like clay puppets or something
sort of like clay
no claymation
i guess they were kind of like little dolls
it was before claymation
the ride
i can even sing you the song that to the chapel
hoof beats hoof beats hoof beats
ride goldie ride
ride across the prairie ride
hoof beats hoof beats hoof beats ride cowboy ride
and he looked so dashing on his horse
anyway now he sells trips
like bus trips or something
those tours
you should work for the boston globe
maybe the herald huh
dont laugh
sit up and eat
he sells vacations to disney land
and to disney world
and to knotts berry farm
and he has a name like something tours
whats the name of the company
its usually done through crimson travel
i dont know what the name of the company is
anyway he dresses up in his cowboy outfit and he has his
new side kick sergeant billy because pablo kicked the bucket
and and they sell these trips
on tv
next time we see it ill point it out to you
nonna gotta meet rex trailor
i think theyre called getaway tours
thank you
i knew the word was in there
to the church on sunday
they did
they must have painted one of the tv towers over channel five in needham to look like a church
you know where channel five is right
right near you do it electronics
be that as it may they still had the kids go up to some new england church
did they have a set
that where the kids walked through a doorway
the kids walked inside the set
they walked down the little street
and they would walk into one of the doors
they had all these doors
but the just walked to the other side of a flat
yes but there was no hill
they never left the building
they stayed inside
a hill
they showed him riding across a hill
so thats the magic of tv honey
no thats the magic of a little girl that believes too much
i do not know dont know
sometimes i wish that
whats that
we would be able to go anywhere we wanted
anybody want a compliment me any more
i love you
id still marry you
thank you
id still marry you
did pablo really kick the bucket
i still wanna know the effect that butch for a day had on the young girls on bozo
never mind
why worry about
well hes in the bathroom
must you ask him
what is it
go ahead
the guy pablo died okay
does that make you feel better
now eat up
and ill tell you the story about nonna and rex trailor
while you eat
as a you know you can probably tell from the conversation that i was a big fan of rex trailor
and i watched in town very faithfully
as a child
once when i was a a kid
i was on this group trip
kids in our neighborhoods went on this trip
with the peabody house
when she was a child
when i was a child
eat up
you may not speak
because im concerned about the rice okay
so what happened was they had this big bowl
for everyone to fill out a contest thing
you put your entry in the bowl and i did that like everyone else who could write
and -um
as it turned out
i won the grand prize
go lightly on the pepper because its mostly going onto your spoon
oh yeah dont
get it on the food
the grand prize unfortunately most of it i couldnt have
it was mostly stuff that you hadta be over eighteen to get
yes i know but thats a lot of pepper
watch him and see and -uh spout fire out of his mouth here
i do not mean to make you laugh
i really didnt mean to make you laugh then
with milk in your mouth
anyway chi
the prizes were a little shopping spree
for i dont know like thirty dollars real fancy store
i dont know
bonwit teller i think was the store
and a night out for two people with rex trailor
the people get to choose
the winner gets to choose anywhere they wanna go
since i was too young for the prize
i got a token -uh flower arrangement
fresh flowers all pretty all around this candle in the middle
well i liked in anyway
but the other part i got out of it was really good
because the people on their trip with rex trailor get to have a limousine pick them up
was it a limousine
a rolls royce
how could i forget
i dont know
you still have the picture
its fading
i need a copy of it before its gone
well itll never go forever even if it fades completely from view
we can bring it back
oh good because a lot of my childhood is
but if we sepia tone chemical name them
oh okay
we can take whatever silver base there is
and bring them out
and bring them out
anyway chi eat up
what happened was
since i was the winner and i didnt get to go on a trip with rex trailor
when the rolls royce guy came to our house in the projects
to pick up n nonna and -uh steve smith was her boyfriend who lived with us
a real nice guy
-um they decided to go to a poetry reading of dylan dylan thomas poetry reading
and rex trailor hadta go with them to the
and anyway so this beautiful rolls royce with real firm seats comes in
and since i didnt win
i won but i couldnt go
i we gotta have a ride anywhere we wanted before they took -uh
before the took nonna and steve over to their -um big event for the night
no no
not that anywhere
what we did was we went to nanas and back
so nana gotta see all of us in a rolls royce in everett
and then back to some of the projects and we had the guy beep his horn
so everyone would look out and see us in a rolls royce and
and uncle george was there
he was
no we kicked him aside and said george this is
george this is mine
yeah no
george came along
he was georgie back then
he was
so we had fun
because we had this great trip -uh in a rolls royce which -uh was very exciting
and then
im sorry
if youll excuse me
i understand
so anyway nonna gotta go to bonwit teller and buy herself a fancy pair of shoes i think
i dont know what else she got
and they decided to go to a poetry reading of dylan thomas which
hm ive heard was a childs christmas and what else
dad reads it sometimes
and we just saw a thing about it on the tv once s story of it
and rex trailor apparently
doesnt really like poetry reading
he was not very pleased
he hadta go and they had dinner with rex trailor
and then they went to a poetry reading and
-uh i guess he was really bored and
he wasnt pleased and nonna was very embarrassed to have dinner with rex trailor
she thought it was a thing that was embarrassing
she didnt want me to tell any of her friends
that she had dinner with rex trailor
oh she thought it was silly
but she gotta have a
and that was the story
thats why dad said dont bring rex trailor to the poetry reading
because of that story
you can ask nonna about it
next time you see her which will probably be sunday when we have a birthday party for dylan chis older brother
say ask her about it
and you see shell have an embarrassed face
and sometime when i come across the photograph ill show you
the driver of the -um rolls royce took a picture for us
and -uh gave it to me
of -um me and nonna and steve and
-uh me george
you know it i cant remember if uncle george was in the picture
i might have said it was you cant be in the picture
i i cant remember if i was that crummy
i dont think uncle george really cared about whether or not he was in the picture
because he gotta ride in a rolls royce and both of us were having a lot of fun in the back seat
it was all real furs
fancy car
real fur
fur on that seat
it was very strange
i i know
theres a
see at the time i really didnt have a problem with it
-um i really cant tell you
i thought it was very luxurious
now it would really gross me out
the thought of
you know
but people have fur coats
you just watched -uh
whos the boss
what kind of coat did that samantha get
where do you think they got the fur
it was a real fur coat
people still have real fur coats
and buy them
fewer people now then there useta be
it useta be a s
you know what you call a symbol of greatness
to have a fur coat
people still think its a symbol of greatness
but a lot of people think its
i wouldnt
i wouldnt want a real fur coat
and eat
aw yuck
its over there
and dont drop any more
its getting late
there at the rate youre going
youre not going to be able to have a dessert
because youre eating too slowly
i will ask you one more thing though
did you eat all your lunch
there hm
why are you shaking your head
youre eating dinner
youre not doing a dance
did you eat your peanut butter and jelly sandwich
did you eat your pretzels
your raisins
drink your juice
great you have an empty lunchbox
you ate the sandwich
you really ate it right you didnt
do anything else with it did you
how was it
how was the peanut butter
what kind of peanut butter was it
just checking
just checking
just in case chi you trying to pull one over on me and
just pretend that you ate it
because that would be very bad
chi did you eat your lunch
just questioning you because
no offense
you have this real guilty
and i figure that it means something or it might mean something
alright now its getting real late
what youre gonna have to do is start your homework
you wanna start your work while youre eating
to give you a little bit of a break here with your food
thats what happens if you eat too fast
which you will not have
thats what happens if you dont eat enough
okay so
oh you can barely read this
i can barely read this
one question one
your blank helps you breathe
so its one across
do you have something to write
you can grab it over there
you know how to spell lungs
tr try it
you do capitals
is that what your teacher said
i noticed that they dont have any capitals on this little picture
well how many letters is
how many is that
so how many letters are on this across
its three across so how many letters
this count this
one two three four five six
so how many letters are in this other word
maybe thats it
does your tongue help you to taste
and swallow
oh thats easy
lips dont help you chew
lips dont help you swallow
youve just eating
you mustve noticed that
oh my
well have a bite
it might help bring this back to you
dont be slow with me
check off the one you already did
so do three across
thats correct
why thats readable
oh its not in capital
i dont personally think its gonna make a difference
might as well do it perfectly
so check that one off and go to the next one
does not
whats the word
what do you think
you know what this is when youre learning about your body
thats learning about places on the earth
its called anatomy
not that you needta know that
check it off
now what number is that at the top
well lets check out
whats just well
i would say whats disgusting about digestion
it it isnt disgusting once you really think about it huh
so you know that you have the right one
so write that out
very good
check that
oh you did
so now
take a bite food
lets move this over chi
this is ridiculous
just read to yourself
ill help you
make it possible
blank makes it possible for you to move
without your blank your head a blank
oh okay
but thats two different ones i believe
so five across is what
what makes it possible for you to move
think so
find five across
thats what popeye calls them
yes sir
its not an expression that you use
and well check that off
got food all over your homework
i know
thats enough
you ever hear of the readers digest
its a magazine
its the truth
its a real magazine
its called readers digest
for people who cant stomach long articles
they cut everything down to a small size to read
come on
have another bite
here have some milk
no actually i cant
a what
i really dont get it chi
im very sorry
i i but i still dont -um see
i dont get what you were picturing when you say that
with the manuscript
oh i do not know dont know
ill but ill take your word for it chi
lets just go on
now without your what
your mind is a blank did you say
to see
oh you checked it off before you did it
okay well why dont you leave that
oh wait a minute
its the last one across
see what else is across
what is across
now i bet its seven
well use your brains
without your what you could not think
see he keeps forgetting
his mind is a blank again
well isnt it
without your blank
you could not think
its your paper
so when they say without your
theyre talking to you
come one chi
if you write it like that its brian
you know i think we ought to take down the nineteen ninety one calendar
its too bad
i i like it
well we didnt put it up until the second half of nineteen ninety one
well we could always
no it was in the summer
we could always just cut out all the pictures and put them up
just use your brian and get on with it here okay
yeah so now
go the down
are you sure
its not your tongue
you to speak and form words and your lips help you to chew
maybe you have it right after all
i cant because you havent finished your milk
if spill the milk chi ill just pour you more
very good
that was interesting
and then they were going
no its the same ones
then that bone they had looked like it mustve been the bone of
that dog guy catcher guy
it was gross
especially the way the bone looked
you know
well i think that we missed the beginning of it
but i believe like he was the kid that just came there for the summer
they didnt say that the dogs killed the kid on the movie
i dont think so
when the dog gave back that retainer
the kids retainer
i thought that it was a sign that he was giving that retainer back for the kids for them
they saw their friend again
chi what
dont look at me
dont look at me
just hand me your milk
i ate all my dinner
so if i wanna have a little taste of sugar now
its red crystal sugar
drink your milk
because if dad were to come in while you were there
spitting your milk out or anything disgusting like that
hed probably get ang aggravated
hide the sugar
where is sugar where is sugar here i am here i am
how are you today
run and hide
little kids do that just to be fresh
am not
what do you call it
who useta do that
not you
you just remember seeing other kids do it
in open center
put your fingers in your mouth
you didnt have sugar on them
oh speaking of sugar chi
i was walking in the kitchen
and guess what
i walked over by the refrigerator right
and there was sugar on the floor
white sugar on the floor
and i was just wondering
do you know how it got there
what were you doing
with the sugar
i would say thats gross except
it would be hypocritical of me
there we go
now put it down
and now i say to you chi
thats disgusting
dont eat handfuls of sugar
you got sugar on the floor
you dont want sugar on the floor
believe me
somehow i thought it was
it was either you or dad
i thought about it long and hard chi
and i eliminated dad as the one who may have spilt spilled sugar
it could happen
your dad doesnt spill things right in front of the
in fact i cant remember the last time your dad spilt spilled anything in front of the fridge
i know
but i knew that i wasnt the one that spilt spilled the sugar
but by the time i noticed it i think it was either after bedtime or you were out playing
i dont know
there was some reason why i could not ask you about it
dont do it anymore
im innocent
look at that
my hands clean
no sugar
no its not
leave my finger alone
a little reddish there her finger -eh
mustve been that nail polish
well over on the other side hm
chi leave it
you are still eating dinner
whatever dads listening to or watching has interesting music on
can you hear it
no i like the sound of it
honey what are you watching
what are you watching
a special about indians
a special about an indian
it might be interesting
the music sounded good
it sounded kind of
it sounded kind of sad
eerie indiana is outlandish
thats when things are so strange that they dont
when they seem sort of out of context
if you were working in a bank where everyone wears s
you know how they wear the suits
and the women wear dress in kind of quiet colors
lets say you came to work with big feathers sticking out of your hair and stuff
and red tassels
that would be outlandish
because it doesnt fit in with your you know what you would wear to work in a bank
yeah that would be outlandish
aw chi
oh my gosh
i just looked at the time
i believe we were watching jeopardy when we sat down to dinner
i believe youve been eating for over an hour now
and ive been doing most of the talking so
there really isnt any reason that you should be at this point
not only that but you really need a bath
youre gonna have to hop in the tub real fast

quit bitching
you go to bed
obviously you didnt get enough sleep over marshalls last night seeing youre taking it out on me
well now im nervous mom
no its
have we started yet
looks like mom already had a french fry
now lets be thankful
well id like to be thankful but we already started eating so
im thankful
whats your problem chi
youre thankful
oh well thats good to know
im glad your thankful
wheres the microphone on this
put it like here
try and rearrange the table so that the recorder can hear things
i guess were about as thankful as we can get
you know one of my guilt provoking little little pagan grace things
but -uh
thats okay
looks like i got the fork with hot chocolate on it
its sticky
i think its the way you sleep
whats happening in the living room
where did chi go
to get a drink
some grey poupon in the fridge
in the morning when i snore
you dont look bad
was she making faces at you
its only an audio recorder
its not gonna pick up the faces that mummy makes at you
i think they have video cameras that are just a little bit bigger than that
little sony things
the video cameras are just like so heavy
well these use little eight millimeter cassettes
about the same size as a audio cassette
a little bigger
it has got like a door thing on the top
is the rice too watery
fine with me
its not sticky
but its not watery
i wouldnt call it watery
but for some reason its a different kind of rice than that im useta
mm try a little pepper on it its good
in something like this chili you dont really taste the pepper as much
hm the sunset seems a lot further south than it useta
no its not
it is further south
the sunset
it useta be part way
it useta be that way
almost exactly west
a little to the south
but now its all the way around the that wing of the building
thats its been since ive sat down to eat dinner here
at this time of the night
its a great sunset
thats what you get for having to work twelve thiry twelve thirty to nine
you dont get to sit and eat dinner with us
only on the weekend
and even then its like were always on the go and everything
and we get everything we couldnt get done during the week
even when i worked at the hotel though we wouldnt have dinner
well we would have once a week
sunday nights wed have dinner
but itd be much later than this
its only twenty of five
thats because the sun set later then
its already twilight
so howdya how do you like -uh vegetarian chili with rice
you have very interesting eating habits chi
i useta do things like that when i went to summer camp
use to make like little landscapes out of my food
especially the mashed potatos
mashed potatos was great for making like mountains and things with
make some peas like in the middle
oh yeah
especially if you got peas you can sorta sort of like roll them down the side
like a little landslide down the side
oh theyre great
its hard to make a fort with mashed potatos
you can do it maybe with french fries
make like a little log log cabin design
what mashed potatos
i never had mashed potatos there
i always did
oh you did
i always did up until i moved here
and now like the only time i dont use real potatos is when i make potato pie because you cant
you cant use it with that
its not necessary to make mashed potatos from fresh potatos
its nice and all but its much harder
well i have potato pie in the freezer
yeah because i just threw one out that was in the fridge
but its in the freezer and you just throw it in the oven about a half an hour or so to brown it
on mashed potatos
chi you remember that
-um answer my question
are you telling a tale
because i im not interested with your making up a story
but what
call the publisher
its okay to tell stories but please tell us youre telling me a story
its good to have an imagination chi
people needta know whether youre telling the truth or not
so that people dont think youre gonna be lying all the time
you know the one about the boy who cried wolf dont you
whats it about
oh its about a boy who cried wolf
i use to do stuff like that in school
no this morning no kidding
i told him turn off the tv and go get a book
he comes out here with a book
flips through it
and he says okay im done now what
i say chi whats the book about
he says its about a boy and a tree
you know the giving tree
thats because i read it to him about a million times
he says its about a boy and a tree
and i said chi you needta think
the book is designed to provoke you to think
it is not about a boy and a tree
about a boy and a tree
and if you come out here and tell me its about a boy and a tree im gonna tell you to read the book again
but you read it so fast the first time i thought it wouldnt make any difference
yeah but weve read it so many times in the past
its a good book but i think its sad
mm can i have a napkin please
because there was nothing left of the tree really
until it had nothing else to give
and then th the boy still had demands for the tree
i just need a place to sit
well come sit on my stump
so what did he do
he made a boat out of the trunk
there really only a few cultures that make boats out of tree trunks
that hollow out the inside of the trunk
mostly pacific -uh pacific island cultures do that
only thats not a commonplace thing
usually when they make boats they make them like rafts
no other cultures
i mean like -uh you know just the average person would not make a boat out of a tree trunk
excuse me
you have to eat more
you do not have to eat all of it
eat it
you were eating it before
mix it with the rice
with the
im not kidding it really tastes better
you dont have to eat all of it
you do have to eat some of it
you ate the rice
you didnt eat any of the chili
he conveniently ate around the chili
you made a circle
a square
eat it
you love it chi
well youre not getting any french fries
put it back
why do they call them french fries if theyre not really fried
dont you think the food and drug administration would have something to say about this
you done
i might have a little more
i havent decided
dad whats the matter
want me to get it for you
no i havent decided
i know you havent decided
but do you want me to get it for you
no thanks
remember just squeezed orange juice
up to six months ago
eight months yeah
eight months ago
frozen whole
i mean it really is
as soon as you pour it in the glass it separates immediately
i mean
they have it on the menu as fresh freshly squeezed orange juice when in fact its nothing of the sort
well for that price you would expect freshly squeezed orange juice
its like three dollars a glass
but where where you know where is the same people who cracked down on citrus hill
i know
a little more
its not gonna kill you
you know it might give you a little gas thats all
making you ill
well then you dont have to eat it if its making you ill
chili and then well put you in and you can take a bubble bath
you got bubble bath
its a joke about you know how he likes to take a bubble bath
nobody got it but me
so thats alright
i dont think in those terms fat
you dont have to eat any more if you dont wanna
you cannot eat anything else either
excuse me
oh just like when hes so full he cant eat another bite and he orders dessert
i know
hes funny
beautiful sunset
it is
it is down all the way
the suns down all the way
cant see the sun any more
so eat around them
you can pick them up with your fork
i dont care
i dont think the beans will be too offended
that thats both cans of -um vegetarian chili
used both cans of vegetarian chili
oh really
because the one i opened the first one didnt look like very much
because i was thinking that doesnt look pinto beans
theyre small
i had some pinto beans in here
and kidney beans
lentils are kidney beans right
but theyre the same size
lentils are the little tiny ones
oh yeah
i thought they were the big ones
no kidney beans are those ones shaped like a kidney
well black eyed
you know i mean theres a lot of beans that are generally that size and shape
thats fine but you cant eat anything else
if you cant eat chili your chili you cant have french fries
oh but you said youd eat it
yes you did
yes you did
before dinner when i said would you eat chili
i shoulda shouldve had the taperecorder going then
play it back
but i didnt
because i woulda wouldve like a macaroni and cheese or something if you didnt like it
you said you would eat it
it is plain chili
it has no meat in it
how do you define plain chili
you know what you do
with the beans and then theyll be like meat
theyll be mashed beans
ew dont do that
thats gross
so clean out the plate and go give him some more
actually chili with meat is is rather quite disgusting
but you dont know what kind of meat i is in there
sometimes they use hamburger
sometimes they use like ground pork
what do you think sausages are made from
they take the you know the pork that they dont want anymore
they grind it up
they stick it into the pigs intestine
they tie a little knot on either end
and they fry it up
oh sounds lovely
im glad im a vegetarian
i happen to like sausages
but eat them
thought you were vegetarian too
i am
doesnt mean i cant like them
is that like now that im married i dont have a particular type of woman i prefer over others
like peopleve been telling me that for years
oh hes youre married
you dont have a type
i dont have a type
what did i marry
an inflatable doll
of course i have a type
so theyre always gone for months at a time
i couldnt take that
and their insurance sucks too
it does
they tell me they have really bad insurance
watch your language
watch your language
did i say a bad word
you did
i dont know what i said
see its like a habit
no its just my mouth was going faster than my brain
you better eat that before your chili gets cold
then itll taste even worse
when its cold
you know whats even worse
is if you make like chili with meat you know with all that fat and everything in it
and you throw it in the fridge
and then take it out it has got like this layer of orange jelly on top of it
its gross
you dont have to
and chicken soup is even worse
youre not having any dessert or french fries
youll be lucky if you get to eat breakfast
no chi if youre not full
no youre not
no youre not
got any clean spatulas
theyre in the dishwasher
plug your ears
come on
come on
i wanted to spank him
now or never
sit chi come here
this is being taped
that means that this is sposta be
a typical dinner with us
and this is like
our typical dinner at home probably does not consist of chi playing with his food
not eating
begging for dessert
slapping daddys hand
yes it is
you know im beginning to think we should stop the tape and well start it again some other time
when chis actually going to eat what we put on the plate in front him
as a matter of fact i dont think it would be out of line to say chi you cant eat anything else until you finish whats on the plate
whether its cold or whether it has been sitting in the fridge for a month
somalia is not funny
they can eat you
chi if you lived in somalia
if you were a kid living in somalia you wouldnt be living any more
no they dont live very long
of them die every day
every day
i dont know what that is times three hundred and sixty five but it has been going on for years
its theres nothing funny
eat your dinner
and i bet you if you sent that off to somalia that will would probably have to go go be split up between about a hundred people
so they wouldnt even get like half a bean each
and thats what theyll
i could imagine that they would have quite a with our garbage
and just the little that weve managed to throw away
i know
its pretty sad
i think we ought to send this kid up to the peace corps
arent we going into mozambique too
i dont see a tongue
eat your dinner
just eat it
just eat it
come on eat that chili just eat it
just eat it
weird al yankovic
yeah he did write a song like that
eat it
and he did a little parody of michael jacksons little song
-um which was
and theres weird al you know like there was this huge fat person across from him sitting at the table
kinda kind of like that monty python thing in the meaning of life
ew yeah
i mean just just huge beyond the limit of of human proportions
covering -uh the kinks
of course also simultaneously making fun of the star wars trilogy
to make fun of
a what
yeah right
youve been knocking among the doors around here asking if you can borrow a cup of hamburger
have you seen this commercial
this guy whos tossing and turning all night
he goes over to his neighbors house
now he hasta go outside the house
its the middle of winter
hes out there in his pajamas to borrow a cup of nyquil
the man has got a cold
and yet
i mean maybe he put on his little bunny slippers or something
hes out th
i mean its like snowing out
why he needs the nyquil
just eat it
eat it
ny nyquils an evil little concoction
its alcohol
its like forty five percent alcohol yeah
which is pretty high as medicines go
ninety proof
as high as medicine go but youre only taking really like a shot
or a shot and a half of it really
but yeah i mean it would be like you know
in the olden days they useta take a shot of brandy when anybody was sick
everybody would drink brandy or whatever it was
in the central part of the country youre right
if you were sick break out the booze
like here in the northeast itd probably be like whiskey and scotch because you know we were doing a lot business with -um scotland and ireland at the time
and thats pretty much what they make over there
what should we have for dessert
although there are a few good irish beers
what would you like daddy
guiness killians
there a few good irish beers
daddys ignoring me
theres some good english beers
for dessert
did we get like an ice cream log or something
i thought we did
jimmy roll
like a jimmy roll yeah
i just thought we did
i guess i was wrong
yeah we ate
we ate that already
we ate that
who the hell was here
that was thanksgiving we had that wasnt it
no we had the turkey cake at thanksgiving
i remember friendly jubilee roll
for halloween or someplace
i mean this is like
they dont make them for halloween
theyre its thing
no the jubilee roll is is
we didnt buy them
remember we were at sup purity supreme and you were here
and looked at them to see what they were
and i didnt buy one
theyre good though
theyre like five dollars and something
im glad
when everybody comes up
speaking of which you gotta call them
yes i do

youre the one who likes to spend half you know half your life on the phone
i dont
i do it for
i do it for a living
i do it for a living

let bro see chi nickname

yeah look
just about
what happened when you went to the bird sanctuary
how was the bird sanctuary
what are you what did you do
i saw that your boots were disgusting
they had mud all inside of them
i know
what are you what did you do
was it a baby bird or an adult bird
so how did the mud get in your boots
th thats my question
so does skip live at the sanctuary
parents just run it
well thats pretty neat
so thats where his parents work
they run the bird sanctuary
and they live there sometimes
and sometimes when i guess during the winter when the sanctuary doesnt needta be taken care of they live at in newton
oh okay
i get it
i thought they lived in newton too but the address on the sanctuary was cape cod
so what did you do
how was the trip
you do on the bus ride down
and was it long
who did you sit with
you sat with who
who did you sit with on the way down
whos jennifer
which one
which girl is she
when i go in i say to all these kids and they dont say hi to me
kind of blondish brown
she has like kind of brownish light eyes
like her hair are kind of the same color
that sounds like the girl who asked me if she could come to your party
remember i told you this little girl ran up to me
and she said can i come to chis party and i said and i said i didnt know who she was
i didnt know her name
but i knew she was in your class
it sounds like that girl
that could be her
i remember
so you sat with her and who else
so was it a long trip
was it boring
you didnt seem to look like you played with any of your stuff on the way down
you didnt have time to play with it or you just
the blue thing
is it blue
what game is that by the way
who brought it
what are you what did you sing
what song was it
how does it go
that one
i useta sing that one when i was a kid
no it doesnt
but its fun to sing
its one of those songs
im amazed you didnt sing the wheels on the bus
did you
because thats a long bus song too
well im glad you had a good time
how long did it take you to get down there
do you have any idea
was it a long time or a short time
it did
thats a long time
and you all didnt get bored
yeah i bet
oh okay
how many adults went
because they stayed there and waiting for you
oh okay
he did
he didnt get out or anything
i bet he had a sore butt when he got home
oh well
so what else did you do
where did you have lunch
and you had lots of good junk food
and did the other kids bring junk food too
when i was a kid i useta love field trips
mostly because you didnt have to eat at school and you gotta bring a really big lunch
and a lot of it because the bus was hot
you didnt
oh well
you know one of the best parts of going on field trips was eating on the bus
any idea what field trips youre gonna going to go on next year
it was a test
was it really
who said it was a test
well i tell you be respectful behave and be quiet
well so you might go on some really neat you know trips next year
thats pretty neat
thats pretty nice
no fifth grade i know
doesnt fifth grade also go like to to new hampshire or something
i think that the science department takes them and they study plant life and
its pretty neat
sanctuary its a bird sanctuary
thats where birds -um are protected
and you know no one can hunt them and you know
they just kind of protect them so that they grow and they they have eggs and they roost and do all that
did you really
was it fun
did you climb on the rock
whats that
well yeah
thats pretty important
i guess it depends on how high the high tide gets
remember that story we saw on the news where that boy went on that rock
and it was really low tide and his friends were playing on the rock
and then the electric plant let out their water because it has you know a dam
its a hydroelectric plant
they use water to to make energy
and they let out their water all th his friends left him and he got stuck in that big rock with you know water spewing by him really hard
and he couldnt get off
no the water was way to strong for him to swim
he wouldve drowned if he wouldve jumped into the water so it was really smart of him just to stay there
and his friends went and got help
and then at like hours and hours later a helicopter hadta come down and and pick him up
he would have drowned
that water was way to strong for him to swim
well i dont even think even if he could swim
that water was too strong
i mean thats its like having a truck hit you
the speed that water was you know being forced at him
no see he was smart just to sit there but im sure when he got home he was cold and hungry
and wet and sore and stiff
well he was there for something like seven hours
he couldnt go anywhere until someone you know
well i think -um people like that are paid by the state
you know because its like a rescue team
you know like the fire department
gets paid by the state
and paid by the state
i think people who do like stuff like that rescuing and in the coast guard
thats right
they said he got a lot of telephone calls about being on tv and and doing interviews and stuff
i dont know i guess people were interested in him
yeah thats what he said he would like to do
i dont know chi i dont know
well i guess he just thought it was exciting
so anyway
well im looking forward to second grade
dont be silly
im looking forward to you going in and going on new field trips and having new friends and a new teacher
and learning new stuff
i know theres two of them right
ones young
-um ones old and theyre both white right
oh i thought she was an older lady
ones name is grace somebody or other
well i hope you get a really good teacher that next year
yeah and have lots of fun
you know most teachers are usually women
i think it is just one of those careers that women tend to go into
and they dont have many men
to go into it
but i think more at the high school and college level you have more men teachers than women
thats when the men start outnumbering the women
i dont know
its the way its divided up
its its a long story
long story
but if you ask like irene -um how many of her professors are male versus female i think she will probably tell you that most of them are male
no that was in preschool
right that was john
his name was john
i cant think of his last name but sister also was a preschool teacher
so and i think they had another sister that was a preschool s teacher so teachers just kind of ran in his family
you know all of them kind of went into that career
well youre right youre lucky you had a lot of teachers
i didnt particularly like miss marazo this year but as long as you did i guess it was alright
but i thought louisa was great
yeah louisa was fun and funny
and interesting
you know she asked us to go to mexico with her
theyre going down for -um the month of july i think
and and she well
i dont think well be going this time but they go down every summer
so what we might do is you know plan to go down one summer with her
and that would be really nice
and so she said shes practicing her spanish this summer
and i told her you and i would be practicing ours and maybe what we could do is make plans to go down next summer
when our spanish is all polished
and we will speak like the natives
what do you think
and i think that will be fun
she sent us a postcard last -um summer
no they dress pretty much like you and i do
yeah they have we have chi just like boston
exactly like boston
because what what you see in pictures usually is what they
lets see
what their cultural dress is
what their ethnic dress is like when you see pictures of africa you see people you know wrapped up in in kenda cloth and saris and sandals and hair corn rows
but we know africans chi that dont dress like that
we know africans that wear suits and ties and high heels and you know
i mean thats their cultural dress
-um thats their
no some of the villages -um are kept in their original state
you know when they were
well yeah it does
right mexico still does have old buildings
-um i mean theyre historical
youve gotta keep them around so people can see what they useta look like
but they also have houses just like ours
im quite sure they have apartment buildings
i mean you know
yes they do chi
they have hospitals and schools and colleges and universities
i mean they have everything
you know what you see in postcards is the historical stuff
you know the the
excuse me
i i dont understand
whats the question
the old stuff
what about it
no they didnt destroy it all
the whole point is chi theyre keeping it all -um together
how do i say this
theyre taking care of it so that people from generations on generations can see what it looked like
you know
like if we go into downtown
right near my office
and you see those those brown stones
those houses made out of brick theyre all in a row and they all kind of look alike
theyre real fancy up by beacon hill
well anyway
near the state house and the boston common
alright well ill take you around there
some of those houses have been around from the seventeenth and eighteenth century hundreds of years ago
and you know regular people live in them now
but what they do is they keep them around so that people can see what old boston useta look like
so -um you take books back to the library this week
chi yeah you do

between nine and eleven

how come they can actually look around and see if they can actually find the termite
you he probably did male and thought it was flea or something
its just a little flea looking bug
okay so
we need two of those big lights
so for a light to be on like this the last thing you need it the light bulb like that up there
and it say you need two of those for this
you put those kind of lights and they can last for years without blowing
a regular light blow will blow
like solar
so its best to have two of those kind up there
id buy just two of those type there
put in your door
my door
so you will start cleaning and dusting while youre on vacation

the tall ladder down there can get up to the top ones too

nobody wanna steal him
oh well he may be good for something in the long run

you always buying something when you have no money

no you have practice on thursday and then you have a game on saturday
and on wednesday the harvard language people are coming to school remember
and youre gonna give them this tape after we make it
its okay we can talk about it
theyve probably talked to mrs brado by now so you gonna wear the backpack again you think
eat your chili too dont just eat the bread
why dont you wanna go to camp
-um what if you just went to camp a little bit
not every day but like maybe a couple weeks
think youll wanna go at all
you had a good time last year though
are you worried because youre going into the bigger kids camp
what are you worried about
well you know what
the kids that were in small frye last year are getting bigger now just like you are so theyre probably gonna be in the big kids camp this year too
not everybody that you went to small frye with you is gonna going to go again this year but a lot of the kids will and theyll be in the bigger kids camp because they all turn seven this year too
yeah some kids stay back a year
oh well is she going to camp
well i think yo youre gonna know a lot of the kids
and theyre all gonna be your age its not like theyre gonna be you know a lot older than you
theyre gonna be your age and theyre gonna going to be all from beverly and -um a lot of them will be from either the y ymca or from the edwards
and you know the teachers noelle will probably be there and ward
but she worked with you as guys last summer
remember you did swimming with her
so what do you think camp is going to be like this year
what do you think its going to be like
basketballs fun
you know the thing is i think that in the big kids camp they do a lot of the same stuff nature walks and arts and crafts
oh sure they do everybody does nature walks at camp
thats part of being in camp
its like a rule of camp you have to do nature walks
you want two
i dont know
did you
i dont think it was these other seventeen people that are sitting at the table with us
well you know i dont think you have anything to worry about
the big kids camp is going to be a lot the same as the small frye camp
do you know how to pronounce it
no i dont think so
it begins with a i cant pronounce it though
its a fancy indian name
well yeah i have to decide whether i wanna work for rella
what about you and whitney
because if im gonna take care of whitney and erin all summer long its going to be you me whitney and erin every day all day and you and whitney sometimes dont get along
and this wouldnt be
you want some more juice
well do you say that
so what im saying is you and whitney have a hard time getting along sometimes even when you just play over each others houses
and i think you needta think about do you wanna spend your entire summer with whitney every single day because thats when its gonna be
i mean every day chi
this doesnt really have anything to do with camp
regardless of camp what im saying is that if you stay home from camp and you stay with me this summer then im going to be taking care of erin and ah whitney and
yeah i know that but what about you and whitney
you guys argue all the time
shes nice huh
well i guess im just a little bit concerned because i would like to have some time just this summer without being with everybody else also can do some of the stuff we talked about doing
so im trying to figure out rellas gonna want us to start taking care of the kids right when school ends
which means you wouldnt get any time just with you and me
it would be you and me and erin and whitney everyday
which one way would be good i mean youd have kids to play with we could go and do things
-um weve got lot of good ideas about what we could do but you and whitney would have to be able to get along this summer and work out your problems
i mean i guess i havent been around the two of you enough to see how much you fight
is it a lot
what do you guys usually argue about
what do you mean who gets to be yellow
so you guys fight about games
oh yeah
well thats good
so i wanted to find out what you wanted to do
i guess our three choices are we could have the kids with us all summer
and have some more money we could the kids with us and not have any money
or you could go to camp
thats actually a really good idea
thats an excellent idea
-um erin might also be taking music classes that i would have to drive her to
but thats a really good idea chi because if you were taking karate lessons every day you could go to the karate studio for a couple hours and that would give you a break from whitney for awhile

thats a good way to break up the day
is there any other lessons or stuff that you wanna do this summer
art lessons

has she mentioned it to you
well the thing is i think that little league stops when school stops and i dont think they have little league during the summer and then it starts up again in the fall
they do have farm league but i think it also ends at the end of the school year
well you needta speak with your coach about that and i will also because he had just mentioned to me that you and his son kevin right
you and kevin -um might be ready to move up to the farm league by the end of the season because you guys are doing real well and youre the big kids on the team
but why dont you ask him about that at practice on thursday okay
you still have a ways to go youve only had youre first game
but anyway they dont have little league in the summer

it can be a very short letter or a long letter
dear daddy how are you how was work
why not
yes you do
why not
yeah but we talked about this
you have to start writing
it can be really short
just like inv said
it could be one sentence
one sentence
or it could be really silly
you could write something a little bit crazy
you could write something to the turtle
you could the turtle and ask him a joke or you know
i mean
this is not like a school paper or test or anything
right doesnt
hey the world has turned upside down
its whatever you wanna write
or you could write to the one of the birds
well you said you wanted to change larrys name
because larry we found was
because it has a blue beak
that means theyre female
i didnt know that
i didnt either
the color of the beak
the little piece above the beak
where the nose is is blue
blue is means theyre a girl
oh wow
i didnt ever know that
i had no idea
thats the only way you can tell
the coloring
it was larry bird
thats so cute
larrys mother
i know
you can make up a joke
well write that
how about just writing something like what your name is
oh no refers to the pencil which is dull
did it the pencil work
use the sharpener
i think its on top of the bed
do you want me to get it
me too
sounds like its working hard
its too old
its like ten years old
oh really
it is working hard
question cards
sound it out
because i useta be a teacher
what does it sound like
say the word again
well do the next word letter
well you know it starts with an right
go ahead
if it doesnt work you can cross it out and start it again
have to get you a dictionary and words you dont know you can look them up yourself
did you already tell me
the joke
oh yeah
it says whats the vampires favorite candy
do you want me to spell the last one word for you
the answer
you write an answer
its upside down
just turn the paper upside down
you okay
could have something with blood wouldnt it
lets see
mm can you figure out
i do not know dont know
we give up we give up
a sucker
thats a good one
the lollipops that were called suckers
very good
cant believe i couldnt think of that
thats a very good one
well thank you for writing that joke
now i can go share that with people
i always forget jokes but
and we will have a good joke for everyone
you have your own pencil thats great
i the only one that actually needs a pencil
joy joy
joyful noise
anyways what wed like you to do is to write a letter to anyone in the whole wide world
-um one thing though is that we actually keep the letter
so were not sending it
a stamp right
were saving you twenty nine cents
so anyway
about anything
its your letter to write to anyone you want
he answers back

there you go
well how do we start off a letter
yeah you did

alright erase the
thats thats how it sounds
im just gonna ask you about the punctuation
nope not a period
dear santa claus
did you learn about commas yet
its a hard language
just the
youve been thinking this letter out for a long time havent you
you know exactly what youre writing
power what
power screwdriver
oh power wheels okay
i know when you put the you dont need it
and when you need it you
you want an accordion
yeah you are spelling it right
theres just another in there
what i would like is
heres some nice paper
chi youre getting carried away here
anyways -um
very good
anyway what wed like you to do is -um
is to write a letter to anyone you wanna
and actually were gonna tell you the first thing is that well were gonna take the letter
so thats
name right
so anyways what wed like to try to do is try to write a letter to anyone you want and your mom can help you out
does that sound okay to you
here you go
heres a pencil
and heres some paper
and theres your mother
youre gonna take it with you
how about a letter chi
they know you can do that
let me see you write a letter
remember we wrote a story about the book
the bear book
something like that
just a short letter
who do you wanna write a letter to
somebody you havent seen in a while
someone like -um brian or christopher
do you wanna erase this or start a new page
yeah unfortunately i need a better eraser
so if you want want
no just do a new page
thank you
come on
start a letter chi
thats okay
we can scribble it out
cant we
now what did that mean
yeah i know but why did you
their -um their initials
people that youre thinking about writing to
now which one are you gonna write to first
well lets start
where do you wanna
write dear brian
come on you know how to do it
start there
is it the first letter
then write a capital
thats a capital
whats that
you be silly
chi youre being silly now
come on
let me see
you know
where the comma starts
starts with the same place you have a -um
oh god
wait a minute no
thats an apostrophe
you have to write and then we put the comma
dont write messy
write it the way you know you can
heres an eraser
-um so he can read it chi
whats that
you erased part of the
why dont you fix it
you dont have to write fast because theyll theyll wait for you to do it
now you put the comma
and you start it the same place you start a period
where do you put the period
very good good
dear brian
now -um down here
you wanna start
see where the is
wait wait
what are you doing
to who
you wanna write to all of them in one letter
okay why dont we write all their names right after
like dear brian chris and nicholas
how about that it will save space
same as you
now do it
very nice
he spells it
thats right
now you wanna put the comma in the same place
now put the comma in the same place you did for brian
well he spells it that way
yeah but thats how he spells it
even though sometimes it sounds a different way a person likes to spell it the way they like to spell it
so thats how we wrote it
okay you wanna to put a comma after their names
okay now you write the letter part
the part you wanna tell them
know about your new school or your new teacher or friends
because you havent seen them in a while
look what you wrote
can you read it to me
okay good
next time we write to all of them do you think theres an easier way to do it
can you think of one
instead of saying three times
how else can you write that
dear brian christopher and nikki
we can write once and then well save that space
so next time well do it like that okay
and itll save a little time
okay now what do you wanna tell them
you can tell brian youve seen nikki but brian and christopher what what do you wanna say
like if you were on the phone right now and you were talking to them what would you say
youd say instead of but what would you say
you know what
start in a little bit
because when you start the sentence you write in
just a little bit more
that will do it
put it
see where this starts
you wanna put it in a little bit
because this
you gotta write the letter chi
thats okay
you gotta write the letter part
okay you finished that part
well write la lauren afterwards
now you start the sentence a little bit farther in like the second letter in from dear okay
can you do that
so where do you start the
where you gonna put the
what did i just say
you put it in one letter in at least from the
so you start it below the
because thats just the way that it works
its called
you indent it a little bit out so the beginning of of your letter
its the first one
first letter of the sentence right
do you know how to make capital
you can just put the line high and what does it say
how do you spell
what does it sound like
say it
say the word
no say the word
whats the last sound
its really easy
just close your eyes for a second and think about it
get it
thats right
and then you wanna put an exclamation point
do you know what that means
what does it mean
how you do it
who taught you to do that
thats nice but you know what you wanna do
you wanna make sure that point is the same place where your period would be
so you start it way up here
so they go up there
now what else do you wanna say
how about saying something else because you already got their names up there
they know that youre talking to them
say hi how are you or
or i miss you or
well what do you think
say it slowly
say it slow
whats the first word
real easy
come on
thats how you spell it
the first letter
see how easy it is when you think
then what do you
whats the next word
what does it begin with
why dont you sit up and do it
you gotta sit up
come on chi
sit up because it you gotta finish
put the thing there
the part thats in it
now youre acting like a baby
come on
dont be silly
just sit down
whats what is the rest of it called
you just learning that in school
and then whats the last sound
now this word has
go all the way down to the bottom
you know how to do it
i miss you
how do you spell
because you miss him
whats with you
is that the end of the sentence
what do you put there
very good
so read it to me so far
what do you have
okay what else you wanna write
oh thats it
okay so sign it
how do you wanna sign it
w how do they know who its from
love chi
wait a minute wait let me see
you wanna say from or love or see you later
very nice
okay how about making a capital
now just put the comma in and youre all done
okay comma
put it after the
love chi
erase that
very nice
you wanna read it to us
one more time
you did a good job
what wed like you guys to do is try to write a letter to someone anyone that you want
does she get to look at this
as much as you want
you wanna write a letter to dad before he comes back
okay have to tell you though is that we take the letter
so if you wanna write a letter to your dad thats great but hes not necessary going to see it unless he comes back before were done
so we could write it and i could copy it down what you wrote and then you could give him the copy of it
who do you wanna write a letter to
so how do we write a letter
okay you can use this

do you wanna use a marker or pencil
good job
you okay
now you know how to spell
make make sure you leave a little space between
what do you wanna say
do you wanna

no because it says dear dad thats the beginning of the letter
and then you start on the next line
when youre writing a letter to someone
and you start with a capital

private marriage
its not going to be as fun
you in your wedding
you dont have to have a big wedding
you can have
you can get a girls that dont like to kiss much
some girls dont like to kiss
what for
you know what
youre going to change your mind
hes going to change his mind isnt he mark
youre not going to get married either
youre going to find when you get older that you think girls are really cute
you should see
youre going to be chasing all around after those girls

celia is nice
celia is a nice kid
and madeleines cute
and you cant marry them you know that
because you cant marry your cousin
you cant marry your cousins
they wont let you
the rule book wont let you
thats right
its against the law
thats right
its mostly against the law to marry almost any body if theyre not
no i dont ever think youll get married
youre just going to fall in love with a lot of girls thats all
its easier not more easier just easier
what is easier to do
for one thing
you dont get all the stuff
i know you boys love each other so why dont you just stick together
its okay
you guys just stick together
you dont have to get married those drippy little girls with all those kissie stuff
but if you change your mind and you say you know
those girls are pretty neat
you can both get married

mark was having trouble with reading some books that we got him and ross mark said dia
its because -uh the the words are too little dia

and what was interesting about that was this dia
my suggestion is dia
marks suggestion is dia
business is was well used dia
it was like part of a general solution to a problem that everybody was facing at this point dia
actually marks causing us all a lot of problems right now dia

pressure inside the earth
because its very hot inside did you know that
you know about the devil
do you think hes real
how do we know hes not real
he would have to live underground

what do you mean
you get into hyperspace
no marky means the mine layer
mine sweeper mine layer its the one that drops the mines
aha yes
when you start the beginning of the game it goes and it drops them all around in space right
i mean you have to clear them out
mhm yes
can you think of any other mines
what if your teacher says
you better
mind now does that sound the same as the one where you dig
if youre a miner
have you ever heard that a persons a miner
they dig in a mine
theres a difference between a and a
see one of
one has a on the end
which one of them has a on the end
what is that honey
what does that mean
your mind and so its not the same as when you are digging
it doesnt sound the same either well when youre paying attention
but if you talk pittsburgh style then it does sound the same right
its my
you are accusing ross of always blaming you even when you dont make the trouble
is that true
is that why
mhm yes
how many years did he do it
mhm yes you said you saw him blame you a lot of years even when you werent the person that did it
two years
four or five years he blamed you
mhm yes and what else does your horrible brother do
thats all
okay just a minute i have to get the phone
youre gonna tell me the story of youre not elected charlie brown

and thats the end of the story
mhm yes okay now who did lucy wanna win
linus okay
aha yes but how about the other kids
did they want charlie to win
aha yes
i see okay
okay lets see so did lets see if theres anything else in this story russell anderson what happened to russell anderson
he lost
how many people
and so how many
no one voted for what
mhm yes
i see
what is it that made linus lose
who won
but how come
linus won
but what did linus say that was stupid

and how many did linus get
eighty four just one extra one
that was called a
unless okay
mhm yes okay
so can linus fix the lockers
he couldnt do them right
what did he think he was going to do
right and so he cant do it
now what about all the parts in the beginning when they have trouble with their stupid lockers
thats not so interesting yeah
i think youre right so you wanna tell the whole story again one more time
yeah lets tell it one more time so daddy will listen to it
cause you have to do a real good job when youre up there in front of the class
well i think whats the most funny part of the story
i think its when linus talks about the great pumpkin
i think its when linus talks and also what does lucy do to get people to vote for linus
what did she do
you ought to tell them about that okay
okay tell them about that so what are you going to say
how did lucy get people to vote for for her brother
and what did she do with the other kids
yanked him by his collar
had been good to him yeah
and what of the other kids whatd she do to them
yeah but russell anderson said
im running against him
so he wasnt voting but he ended up voting for him anyway
okay so thats the funny part and the other funny part is when linus says instead of giving a speech hes gonna tell them about the great pumpkin
and that made him lose a lot of votes dont you think
thought it was funny
yeah hes a pretty
and because what did lucy say
thats the worst speech i ever heard now i know were going to win
