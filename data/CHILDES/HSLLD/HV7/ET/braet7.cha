@Comment:	MOT and Chi play together with the magnets in a cooperative manner , and the activities are largely suggested and directed by the Chi. Most of the time is spent building things on the black base. The silver men are used most often and are made to represent olympic athletes or wrestlers. There is some magnet talk , and the Mot does attempt to engage the Chi in play that focuses on magnetic forces.
