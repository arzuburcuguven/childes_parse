*PAR0:	shoving it in there . 0_2200
*PAR0:	oh yeah [/] yeah [/] yeah . 2200_9160
*PAR0:	I think the baby wins the day . 9160_17440
*PAR0:	no . 17440_18220
*PAR0:	but &-um they have a lot of stuffed animals at the at our house and then at the place she goes each day for her childcare which is just at another family's house . 18220_28900
*PAR0:	we share a nanny with another family . 28900_30480
*PAR0:	and apparently my husband does the drop off . 30480_33440
*PAR0:	but every morning when she gets there she and the other little girl feed all the babies . 33440_37560
*PAR0:	and they're all the animals and everything . 37560_39640
*PAR0:	and they walk around and feed them all . 39640_41480
*PAR0:	I think that's part of her [/] her routine these days . 42460_46040
*PAR0:	interesting . 46760_47500
*PAR0:	yeah . 48000_48480
*PAR0:	so what are some things that &-um . 48860_50720
*PAR0:	did you see her do anything new with the baby . 50720_53620
*PAR0:	well I've never seen her with a real baby . 53940_56120
*PAR0:	so that was kind of interesting to see her actually putting it in the baby's mouth . 56460_61820
*PAR0:	I mean usually we have things like this that don't necessarily have clear mouths . 61820_65520
*PAR0:	and so it's just kind of like anywhere . 65520_67800
*PAR0:	and this was clearly I know where it's supposed to go . 67800_72360
*PAR0:	yeah . 72360_73480
*PAR0:	but this is kind of her thing you know she'll [/] she'll just kind of go from thing to thing . 73480_80700
*PAR0:	yes . 80700_84220
*PAR0:	ow [/] ow [/] ow . 84220_87520
*PAR0:	and she'll kind of get fixated on something for a while . 88200_91440
*PAR0:	and need you to pay attention to it . 91440_93300
*PAR0:	you know &-uh &-uh oh [/] oh do you think she understands the concept of the bandaid and the words that you're using I think some but probably not all of them but I'm I mean from the time she was very little I've been shocked at how much she understood like things that sort of would freak me out . 93300_115080
*PAR0:	I would say something I thought . 115080_116340
*PAR0:	for the first time ever . 116340_117520
*PAR0:	and she would go do it or look to it . 117520_120600
*PAR0:	and so I've learned from the beginning . 120600_122680
*PAR0:	I just kind of narrate everything . 122680_125260
*PAR0:	I probably do it too much . 125260_126620
*PAR0:	watch out hold on stop Rosie there you go . 126620_130540
*PAR0:	&-um but I think she understands a lot . 130540_134800
*PAR0:	Rosie can you give the bottle to mommy . 134800_138580
*PAR0:	please . 138580_139760
*PAR0:	I don't like that . 139760_140360
*PAR0:	you're eating it . 140360_141220
*PAR0:	that's for other kids to play with . 141220_143080
*PAR0:	and we don't need to like pass germs around . 143080_148360
*PAR0:	how about the stuffed animals . 148360_150220
*PAR0:	how do you play with them . 150220_152360
*PAR0:	mommy's gonna take this . 152360_156500
*PAR0:	this is gonna be mommy's . 156500_157680
*PAR0:	you can play with this . 157680_159200
*PAR0:	I'm gonna stick it in your pocket . 159200_162540
*PAR0:	I think pretty typically she's very into the animals . 162540_166780
*PAR0:	it's bye [/] bye . 166780_167800
*PAR0:	it's bye [/] bye . 167800_168980
*PAR0:	it's all bye [/] bye [/] bye [/] bye . 168980_171660
*PAR0:	she loves dogs . 171660_172720
*PAR0:	so that didn't surprise me that she would look for dogs . 172720_175620
*PAR0:	she's she totally understands now . 176380_180300
*PAR0:	yeah . 180920_181200
*PAR0:	oh what's that . 182040_183020
*PAR0:	cookie . 183220_183640
*PAR0:	yeah I didn't know she knew Winnie the pooh . 183800_191640
*PAR0:	so that was of surprising to me that she would like call him by name and find him . 191860_197580
*PAR0:	I didn't know she knew that . 197580_198440
*PAR0:	so I'm sure they have that at the other house . 198440_201980
*PAR0:	and the same thing happened with Elmo like two months ago . 201980_207880
*PAR0:	I had no idea she knew any of these characters at all . 207880_210500
*PAR0:	and then she's we had a book . 210500_212880
*PAR0:	and Elmo was in it . 212880_213980
*PAR0:	I'd never even noticed that . 213980_215440
*PAR0:	and she was like obsessed with Elmo and it was one of those things where we really didn't even know she knew Elmo yeah [/] yeah . 215440_228080
*PAR0:	does she know the &-um animal names here . 228440_231360
*PAR0:	she probably knows she can point out animals . 231360_235400
*PAR0:	and then when we say it . 235400_236780
*PAR0:	she'll repeat us . 236780_238140
*PAR0:	so the ones that she can point out in a book are definitely you know chicken dog bee . 238140_245000
*PAR0:	<she knows> [/] she knows a lot of their sounds . 245000_248000
*PAR0:	I don't think she would ever like she wouldn't know that's a goose . 248000_251300
*PAR0:	but if we pointed out something and said goose she would know that a goose says honk [/] honk . 251300_255700
*PAR0:	so she probably I would think she would know zebra . 256300_259560
*PAR0:	come here . 259800_260100
*PAR0:	Rosie yeah . 260100_260840
*PAR0:	where's a zebra . 261020_261800
*PAR0:	do you know where a zebra is . 262260_263780
*PAR0:	can you show mommy . 263860_264580
*PAR0:	I don't know if you know that one zebra . 264900_267940
*PAR0:	where's the you mean the ones that she doesn't know or that she played with like this . 268980_291940
*PAR0:	any novel would be definitely novel . 291940_293280
*PAR0:	I have no idea if this is a gopher a beaver a hedgehog . 293280_298200
*PAR0:	I don't know . 298200_299180
*PAR0:	&-um I guess this would be a sea otter . 299180_303260
*PAR0:	we don't talk about otters very much . 303260_306800
*PAR0:	I don't Rosie what's this is this . 306800_311360
*PAR0:	a fox or a weasel . 311360_313840
*PAR0:	I don't know . 313840_314420
*PAR0:	we don't talk about them . 314680_315680
*PAR0:	oh here's two otters that's an otter . 315820_320920
*PAR0:	oh [/] oh yeah . 321340_326400
*PAR0:	but these are probably the only new ones . 326760_328820
*PAR0:	yeah . 328820_330820
*PAR0:	what's that . 330820_337500
*PAR0:	&-um you mean what's new or how she played with them or both . 337500_347560
*PAR0:	&-um she doesn't really probably know ice cream . 347560_351680
*PAR0:	we don't experience that very much . 352100_354100
*PAR0:	I [/] I thought she'd go more for the cheese . 354520_357320
*PAR0:	but maybe it she's starting to figure out that that's like fake or something . 357320_360640
*PAR0:	<we don't> [/] we don't have she just got for Christmas but we haven't opened yet . 360820_365120
*PAR0:	the giant thing of pretend foods . 365120_367740
*PAR0:	so she has a grocery cart . 367740_369620
*PAR0:	but she doesn't fill it with food . 369620_370980
*PAR0:	she . 370980_371180
*PAR0:	fills it with toys . 371180_371940
*PAR0:	and so here I think the pizza . 371940_375260
*PAR0:	she definitely like that's a very iconic thing that she can point out . 375260_378900
*PAR0:	but I don't think she can . 378900_381080
*PAR0:	I thought maybe she'd associate with that with peanut butter because she loves peanut butter . 381080_384960
*PAR0:	but I think the jar looks so different than the one we have that she doesn't get that that's what we're talking about . 384960_391060
*PAR0:	but I could be wrong . 391060_393260
*PAR0:	do you see any bread . 393260_395480
*PAR0:	where's the bread . 395480_397380
*PAR0:	no . 397380_398780
*PAR0:	don't want to you want a cracker . 398780_404220
*PAR0:	I don't see a cracker . 404220_407320
*PAR0:	do you see one . 407320_410520
*PAR0:	you know she it's funny because she used to like books would be the first thing she goes for . 410520_415660
*PAR0:	and now she's much more interested in sort of that dramatic play . 415660_419960
*PAR0:	and like you know the tactile sort of animals and books are more secondary now . 419960_427760
*PAR0:	so I read them a lot and push them a lot . 427760_430500
*PAR0:	but she used to sort of just sort of gravitate and look at books and things like that . 430500_435920
*PAR0:	and not really care as much about stuffed animals . 435920_438460
*PAR0:	and now it's sort of flip-flopped Rosie really seriously . 438460_442920
*PAR0:	they're gonna have to like wash everything down after you <are those peas> [/] are those peas . 442920_452020
*PAR0:	I know I think I was trying to get her to see like one of the things we've [/] we've been working with a specialist because she's so underweight for her age . 452020_464660
*PAR0:	and she's been diagnosed with a infantile anorexia feeding disorder . 464660_470080
*PAR0:	and essentially what they've kind of been working with us on is helping her understand hunger because they just think kids like this don't have the same hunger cues that other kids do . 470080_479700
*PAR0:	and so I try to do a lot of play of where like the baby's hungry . 479700_484520
*PAR0:	and we feed . 484520_485280
*PAR0:	the baby . 485280_485760
*PAR0:	and I try to do that to help her understand that food is for feeding not for playing and throwing and whatever . 485760_494340
*PAR0:	so I think I probably push that . 494340_496440
*PAR0:	and then I get self-conscious that I'm pushing the food . 496440_499480
*PAR0:	so it's always like this battle in my head which is characteristic they say of infantile anorexia is that mom is creating conflict in the feeding relationship . 499480_510560
*PAR0:	so that's always awesome . 510560_511940
*PAR0:	but you're but it's because you're just wanting them to grow and eat and be healthy . 511940_516320
*PAR0:	and you know that they're not &-um so I don't I've been working on that . 516320_521180
*PAR0:	mommy doesn't know exactly the way to play with you about food . 521180_524120
*PAR0:	yeah . 524120_528400
*PAR0:	does she have like favorite food . 528400_530840
*PAR0:	&-um yeah she loves sausage . 530840_533980
*PAR0:	it's like this random thing that we can almost always get her to eat . 533980_538920
*PAR0:	no . 538920_539760
*PAR0:	she does like peanut butter no night [/] night . 539760_544360
*PAR0:	and she loves night [/] night you want to go night [/] night seriously night [/] night . 544360_551720
*PAR0:	well that's later you just got up from a night [/] night . 551720_555200
*PAR0:	oh so we have some favorite foods but oftentimes our issue is not that it's a food . 555200_563660
*PAR0:	she doesn't like it's . 563660_564600
*PAR0:	that she will eat it in such small quantities . 564600_566960
*PAR0:	so she'll love a food . 566960_569080
*PAR0:	she'll take one bite of it . 569080_570160
*PAR0:	and then she'll be done . 570160_571500
*PAR0:	you know she'll start <all done> [/] all done down all done . 571500_575040
*PAR0:	and she's serious about it . 575040_576620
*PAR0:	if you try to like do anything else it starts a holy war . 576620_582360
*PAR0:	yeah you're just too busy . 582360_586600
*PAR0:	you're just too busy here . 586600_590900
*PAR0:	hold on . 590900_591660
*PAR0:	let's put this down . 591660_592740
*PAR0:	step up . 592900_593460
*PAR0:	put your foot up . 593460_594720
*PAR0:	yeah . 594720_596700
*PAR0:	oh now we see it . 596700_601220
*PAR0:	yes . 601220_602120
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 602120_606320
*PAR0:	oh yeah . 606320_607900
*PAR0:	she's [/] she's super aware of all that stuff . 607900_612400
*PAR0:	she's extremely social and perceptive . 612400_617680
*PAR0:	she picks up . 617680_618340
*PAR0:	on things really fast . 618340_619920
*PAR0:	that's one of the reasons . 619920_622040
*PAR0:	like for a long time we weren't really worried about the eating thing because she was kind of off the charts <in terms> [/] in terms of her gross motor fine motor language like everything seemed to be ahead of where it should be . 622040_635280
*PAR0:	so I was like . 635280_636000
*PAR0:	obviously we don't have a stunting issue here . 636000_638720
*PAR0:	but what I didn't realize is that that's also common with some of those feeding disorders . 638720_644840
*PAR0:	is that it's those kids that can't be slowed down to eat . 644840_648580
*PAR0:	food is more of a stimulation than a safety device . 648580_652880
*PAR0:	right . 652880_654080
*PAR0:	are you eating . 654080_661080
*PAR0:	no [/] no [/] no [/] no I that I didn't mess anything up . 661080_672560
*PAR0:	yeah they m- he's gonna fix it . 672560_686240
*PAR0:	my favorite new thing she says is see ya . 703920_706120
*PAR0:	we said it . 706120_707560
*PAR0:	I said it once . 707560_708200
*PAR0:	and she just like did it clear as day . 708200_710360
*PAR0:	see ya you ready to go [/] go you want to go . 710360_715020
*PAR0:	bye [/] bye go fun daddy bye . 715020_719620

*PAR0:	you're like wise beyond your years . 736620_739980
*PAR0:	little one . 739980_740680
*PAR0:	we finally just turned her car seat around because even though she hit a year eight months ago .
*PAR0:	she still is like just under the twenty pound mark that she was supposed to be . 742580_753160
*PAR0:	and we were like . 753160_754560
*PAR0:	okay we're doing a ten hour drive home for Christmas we're not keeping her face backwards . 754560_759380
*PAR0:	it's like she's oh thank you . 759380_761300
*PAR0:	she's in a whole new world . 761300_763140
*PAR0:	she sits in the seat and bounces and calls out everything she sees excitedly . 763140_768800
*PAR0:	she jumps up and down . 768800_770900
*PAR0:	she loves getting in the car . 770900_772880
*PAR0:	we're like . 772880_773500
*PAR0:	man we should have . 773500_774080

*PAR0:	I'm gonna put this up . 789320_790720
*PAR0:	Rosie yeah that was one of the things they actually told us to start working on was to like give her a challenge while she was eating . 790720_801380
*PAR0:	so she didn't get bored so quickly . 801380_803000
*PAR0:	so she has a fork . 803000_804600
*PAR0:	and I have a fork . 804600_805620
*PAR0:	and we both work on it . 805620_807240

*PAR0:	the first try fork it get it right to her mouth . 812060_815160

*PAR0:	it's . 1026920_1027020

*PAR0:	so it's weird . 1031880_1032660
*PAR0:	it's like she'll still drink a whole bottle because she knows to do that . 1032660_1035800

*PAR0:	but we tend to still use a bottle . 1044940_1047380
*PAR0:	and so she'll ask for a bottle . 1047380_1049000
*PAR0:	and if we give her a cup she'll say . 1049000_1051440

*PAR0:	baby . 1150100_1150420
*PAR0:	which is I think is what they say every morning when they feed the babies because that wasn't something we were saying . 1150420_1157780

*PAR0:	she keeps saying the same thing over and over . 1167460_1169720
*PAR0:	and she goes is she saying . 1169720_1171300

*PAR0:	yeah . 1173360_1173780
*PAR0:	and she said . 1173780_1174500
*PAR0:	that's because they get so they don't want to have their diaper changed . 1174500_1177240
*PAR0:	and so she said . 1177240_1177880
*PAR0:	I just sit there and say . 1177880_1178580
*PAR0:	<I know> [/] I know you don't . 1178580_1180300
*PAR0:	I . 1180840_1181080

*PAR0:	and I I'll have to ask the nanny what is this all about . 1208680_1213320
*PAR0:	and she just laughs because they don't do it for her . 1213320_1216280
*PAR0:	but they do it when no one's saying it they [/] they theythey know that it's supposed to be said . 1216280_1220080
*PAR0:	so then they'll actually say it right . 1220160_1223020
*PAR0:	and the other one was like &-um something like it's okay or it's okay . 1223640_1229240
