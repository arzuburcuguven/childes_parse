@Comment:	The tone of the conversation is friendly during this activity. In the beginning , MOT brings up how magnets can destroy tapes and the television set. Soon afterward , a conversation surrounding the purpose of the flat silver circle emerges , and Chi gives an explanation for how it works which isn't quite correct. Mot asks several questions about how things work. Towards the end of the activity Chi brings in his own magnet set , and Mot and Chi play with both sets. EXP remains in the background of the talk. Video taping does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
*CHI:	I only xxx the regular kind .
*INV:	www .
%com:	talking about setting up the camera and the amount of time for activity .
*CHI:	let's see .
*CHI:	what do we have here .
*INV:	there you go .
*CHI:	what is this ?
%act:	looks in a large plastic bag to see what's inside
%com:	videotape starts here
%sit:	MOT and Chi are on one side of a coffee table; Mot sits on the couch and Chi kneels on the floor
*CHI:	xxx .
*CHI:	oh acrobats [= magnet set] !
*CHI:	+^ I love acrobats !
*CHI:	+^ I have this [= magnet set] !
*MOT:	xxx .
*MOT:	oh .
*MOT:	oh like the &-uh +...
*CHI:	yes I have this exact thing [= magnet set] .
%act:	takes the box of magnets out of the plastic bag
*MOT:	oh with the little guys [= silver men] too .
*CHI:	so like what's our motive ?
*CHI:	+^ just to play with it [= magnet set] ?
*INV:	that's it .
*CHI:	okay .
*INV:	www .
%sit:	talks about camera
*CHI:	wrong way .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	this [= referent unclear] is the way it's [= magnet set] sposta be .
*CHI:	+^ and I didn't think xxx .
*CHI:	attachable .
*MOT:	don't tell me where it's [= referent unclear] sposta be .
%sit:	a plastic box containing the silver pieces and magnets is attached to the black base; Mot and Chi pull the box and the base magnet apart
*CHI:	no (.) I was just showing you which way [!] it [= black base] was sposta be .
*CHI:	this [= silver circle on black base , maybe] is the magnetic field .
*INV:	(wh)oops sorry .
%act:	dumps the yellow wand onto the coffee table; it makes a loud noise
*CHI:	it's alright .
*MOT:	wow we have a wand [= yellow wand] too .
*MOT:	Chi learned a valuable thing about these (.) kind of wands when he was young .
*INV:	yeah you can't put them near anything like this [= taperecorder maybe] right ?
*MOT:	right .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	and like the t@l v@l .
*INV:	yeah or the video [>] .
*MOT:	<we have> [<] .

*CHI:	sorry !
*MOT:	stain on our picture screen .
*INV:	really ?
*MOT:	it was years ago and at least the bright color has faded .
*CHI:	I'm sorry mom .
*CHI:	this one [= a washer] xxx .
*INV:	I'm gonna hafta put this [= taperecorder] way over here [= away from the magnets] .
*INV:	+^ I'll just put it [= taperecorder] over here [= away from the magnets] .
*MOT:	no I don't think it's [/] it's +//.
*MOT:	as long as you don't put it [= taperecorder] up to it [= yellow wand] .
*INV:	<it's [= yellow wand] not strong enough to cause any damage> [>] .
*CHI:	<great mom> [<] .
*CHI:	great mom .
*CHI:	look .
%sit:	a silver man stands on the black base with a washer on its head
*MOT:	why don't you just put it [= taperecorder] right there .
*CHI:	why don't you just lay it [= referent unclear] on top !
%int:	voice raises to scream on last word
%sit:	Chi is arranging the silver men , washers and nuts on the black base; Mot helps; Chi screams at the end because a silver man fell
*MOT:	hey .
*CHI:	he [= silver men that fell] is presumed dead .
*MOT:	he [= silver man that fell] can carry this load [= a nut] .
%act:	moves to place a nut on a silver man's head
*CHI:	&~ha !
*CHI:	watch .
*MOT:	oh yeah ?
*MOT:	+^ look at that !
%com:	refers to a nut which rests on the silver man's head while the man remains standing
*CHI:	real xxx .
%act:	places a washer on top of the nut
*MOT:	they [= referent unclear] don't have very many wands .
%act:	touches the objects on the black base with a silver stick
%com:	MOT may be referring to the silver stick when she says wands
*CHI:	why ?
*CHI:	nice mom .
%sit:	the stick falls out of Mot's hands
*MOT:	trying .
%act:	puts the silver stick through the hole in the washer and nut
*MOT:	no .
*MOT:	you know .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
%sit:	two of the silver men on the base fell as a result of Mot's actions
*MOT:	I know what I'm tryin(g) to do !

*MOT:	you're wondering about the San Andreas fault huh ?
*CHI:	now watch .
%act:	lays the silver stick across the tops of a washer and a nut which rest on two silver men on the black base , and then puts a silver man on top of the stick; one of the silver men on the base falls
*CHI:	here watch .
%act:	removes the sticks from the silver men and puts them aside
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	if you take (.) two normal people [= silver men] +...
*MOT:	normal people [= silver men] ?
*CHI:	people without anything (.) around xxx .
*MOT:	something without a &~l lug nut or whatever you call these things [= nuts and washers] ?
*CHI:	now go like this +...
%act:	lays a silver stick across the shoulders of two silver men
*CHI:	here .
%act:	lays another silver stick across the other shoulders of the two silver men; the formation now looks like parallel bars
*CHI:	now you go +...
*CHI:	this (.) like this .
*INV:	I'll do this .
%com:	camera moves as EXP finds a better position from which to watch
*INV:	that way I can see this [= Chi working with the magnets] .
*INV:	(be)cause I'm very interested in what you're doing here [= on the table with the magnets] .
*CHI:	like this .
%act:	places a silver man upside down on the <parallel bars>
*CHI:	this .
%com:	refers to the act described above
*MOT:	want a pillow or something ?
*INV:	no .
*INV:	+^ uhuh .
*CHI:	cool [?] .
*CHI:	+^ now you go +...
*CHI:	(.) this .
%act:	places another silver man , standing upright , on top of the other silver man which is on the parallel bars
*MOT:	yes .
*CHI:	very complex .
*CHI:	mind if I take this guy [= Mot's structure of one silver man and four nuts and washers] apart for a second ?
*MOT:	fine [>] .
*CHI:	0 [<] .
%act:	removes a nut from the top of the silver man
%sit:	Chi actually waits to see if it is okay to take the nut from a structure which Mot has made before he actually takes it
*MOT:	+^ go ahead .
*CHI:	and now go +...
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	places the red ball on the black base where Chi is building his structure

*CHI:	ah !
%sit:	the stack of three silver men falls because Mot put the yellow wand close to them
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	fine mom .
%act:	takes the yellow wand from Mot
*CHI:	mom .
*CHI:	oh !
%act:	puts the yellow wand close to the red ball; the red ball rolls over the silver stick and falls down onto the base
*CHI:	squiggly !
%act:	moves the red ball with the yellow wand
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	lifts a silver stick off one of the silver man's shoulders; it stands up straight and attaches to the yellow wand , then the stick falls
*CHI:	great mom .
*MOT:	0 .
%act:	lifts the second silver stick; the same process as described above occurs
*CHI:	perfect [>] .
*MOT:	<that's it [= referent unclear]> [<] .

%sit:	MOT is quiet; Chi sets down the yellow wand and picks up a washer
*CHI:	dad [?] likes to play horseshoes .
%act:	puts a washer over a silver stick which Mot holds perpendicular to the base
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	ugh !
%sit:	is unable to make the washer go over the stick
*MOT:	&=laughs [>] .
*CHI:	<I hate magnets> [<] .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	turns to face the couch , which is behind Chi , and burries his face in the pillow
*MOT:	having troubles ?
*CHI:	ugh .
*MOT:	I am too &=laughs !
%act:	tries to get a washer to stand on its side on the black base
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*CHI:	I guess you're having a bit more fun than I [!] am even .
%act:	turns around to face coffee table again
*MOT:	what happens if you take this [= flat silver circle] off [= the black base] ?
%act:	removes the flat silver circle , and all pieces on top of it , from the base
*CHI:	oh great mom .
*INV:	oh .
*CHI:	+^ you just took the electromagnetic field off .
*MOT:	did I ?
*INV:	unhunh [>] .
*MOT:	<no it's [= magnetic field]> [<] <in here [= black base]> [>] .
%act:	taps the black base with index finger
*CHI:	<it [= flat silver circle] made a force> [<] actually .
*MOT:	I bet you we can still do it [= make things stand , attach , etc.] on this [= black base] .
%act:	tries to make a silver man stand on the black base , now without the flat silver circle on top of it; the silver man falls flat
*MOT:	whoa .
*CHI:	oh !
*CHI:	I know !
%act:	tries to pick up a silver man from the table
*CHI:	the greatest thing +/.
*MOT:	different (.) isn't it [= base without the flat circle] ?
*CHI:	yeah it is .
*CHI:	sort of need the (.) magnetic .
*MOT:	why do you need this [= flat silver circle] ?
*CHI:	(be)cause .
*CHI:	it [= perhaps the magnetic force of the black base] can only relate +//.
*CHI:	see !
%act:	tries to stand a silver man up on the base
*CHI:	it [= silver man] wants to be like that [= standing up maybe] .
*CHI:	+^ but on this [= black base , without the flat circle] +...
*MOT:	yeah but why ?
*CHI:	why ?
*MOT:	why does having this [= flat silver circle] [!] on there [= black base] [!] make these guys [= silver men] stand up ?
*CHI:	(be)cause it's [= flace silver circle] relating to it [= black base] and it [= flat silver circle] makes the magnetic field sort of less .
%act:	places the flat silver circle on the black base
*CHI:	(.) so now you can go like +/.
%act:	prepares to place a silver man on the base
*MOT:	wait .
*MOT:	it's [= flat silver circle] upside down now .
*MOT:	isn't it [= flat silver circle] ?

*CHI:	watch and learn mom .
*CHI:	+^ watch .
*MOT:	+^ okay .
*CHI:	watch .
%act:	re-positions the fallen silver man to standing
*MOT:	but why ?
*MOT:	(.) does it [= flat silver circle] (.) disperse the &-um +...
*CHI:	yeah .
*MOT:	+, field ?
*MOT:	+^ (be)cause I never tried it without that (.) metal thing [= flat silver circle] before .
*CHI:	it's because I didn't detach mine [= flat circle] .
*CHI:	they're [= flat silver circle] like (.) sort of crazy glued on [= onto the base] .
*MOT:	oh .
*CHI:	now watch this okay ?
%sit:	Chi has rearranged two silver men so that they're back to holding two silver sticks like parallel bars

%act:	places the red ball on top of the thin round magnet
*CHI:	may I take your +...
%sit:	Chi was going to put something other than the red ball on top of the thin round magnet , but Mot put the ball there first before Chi could put an object on the thin magnet
*MOT:	&=laughs .
*MOT:	fine .
*CHI:	0 .
%act:	removes the red ball
