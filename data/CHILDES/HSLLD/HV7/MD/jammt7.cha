*FAT:	well fine then I'm leavin(g) .
@Comment:	Time is 0:05
@Comment:	the mealtime lasts approximately 19:32. Most of the meal is banter between Fat and Chi about Chi's Christmas wish list , movies , tv , the parents' wedding (when Chi was about 4) , and their pet snakes. The two of them seem to interact well , with both Fat and Chi teasing each other often , and there is lots_of verbal banter. A good example of this is their argument on orange cheese , somewhat near the end of the conversation. Throughout the tape , Chi wishes to turn off the tape and end the conversation , but Fat is resistent until the end. Early on Chi says <we usually don't have dinner conversations> but it may be staged to embarrass Mot. Also possibly staged to embarrass Mot is a segment on the tape after the mealtime is over , when Chi and a friend may or may not be sampling different types of alcohol while watching Rocky Horror Picture Show (they don't appear to know the extra stuff) ... Consensus is that they aren't actually drinking , but their liquor literacy is alarming.
