*PAR0:	&-um what are &-um . 10600_12040
*PAR0:	you just brought me through what you guys played with today . 12040_15400
*PAR0:	what she liked and didn't like and what was different . 15400_18400
*PAR0:	she was very into the food and the spoons which &-uh you know she likes playing with that stuff at home . 18400_24940
*PAR0:	but she's also hungry . 24940_25920
*PAR0:	so she doesn't so much play with it at home . 25920_30340
*PAR0:	but she does know that spoons go with food . 30340_32900
*PAR0:	so that doesn't surprise me at all . 32900_34760
*PAR0:	&-um she was a little bit interested in the baby . 34760_37720
*PAR0:	&-um yeah &-uh she was very interested in these things that had nice texture to them . 37720_44780
*PAR0:	she's teething makes a little sense &-um little bit interested in the plush toys . 45020_50500
*PAR0:	not as much as I would have expected at home . 51100_53920
*PAR0:	she's very into plush toys . 53920_55320
*PAR0:	&-um but I think she sees some other cool stuff that she's not used to . 56200_60320
*PAR0:	and you know she [/] she likes the Peekaboo book . 61300_63660
*PAR0:	so she enjoyed playing with that as well . 64360_66400
*PAR0:	so I think she enjoyed &-um you know a mixture of some familiar things and some new novelty things to her on the part of just food just &-uh background . 66960_78420
*PAR0:	&-um did she like some food from the back of the spoon or &-um I only see . 78980_85340
*PAR0:	&-uh she [/] she didn't go for any of the white spoons . 85340_88120
*PAR0:	went for the colored one blue one . 88280_89920
*PAR0:	and there's a little purple one here . 90380_91840
*PAR0:	and this is about the size of one of her spoons at home . 92360_95900
*PAR0:	so this looks somewhat familiar to her I think . 96060_99300
*PAR0:	but the other one I don't know she liked it . 99700_103520
*PAR0:	okay . 104100_104360
*PAR0:	and &-uh for the stuffed animals . 105040_109040
*PAR0:	&-uh flush toys . 109040_110620
*PAR0:	&-um does she seem to prefer some of them over other . 110620_114300
*PAR0:	she didn't gravitate towards any on her own . 114640_117080
*PAR0:	oh she would take an interest in them when I tried to get her interested and made noises with them and motions . 117400_122460
*PAR0:	and then she would take a little bit of interest in them . 123060_124920
*PAR0:	but she didn't gravitate towards any of them on her own . 125000_127320
*PAR0:	are did you pick ones that she's familiar with or [/] or [/] or was she familiar with ones before . 128220_133360
*PAR0:	&-um not particularly &-um I know that she likes puppets . 133460_137400
*PAR0:	so I started off with the one that I could see was a puppet . 137620_139860
*PAR0:	then you know I just grabbed for what was either within reach or had the sound that I know I mean <I don't> [/] I don't know what groundhog makes . 140520_149460
*PAR0:	so I didn't grab the groundhog . 149460_150820
*PAR0:	I grabbed a chicken . 151060_151840
*PAR0:	I grabbed a frog . 151960_152600
*PAR0:	I grabbed a bee things that were are sounds that we would make together or sounds that I would be making with her sister that would be familiar . 152720_159360
*PAR0:	okay . 159660_160020
*PAR0:	yeah that makes sense . 160360_162920
*PAR0:	yeah . 162980_163180
*PAR0:	&-um does she oh so you do make animal sounds at home . 163660_167160
*PAR0:	oh yeah all the time . 167200_168200
*PAR0:	okay . 168260_168520
*PAR0:	yeah . 168860_169080
*PAR0:	with her sister being just a couple years older and learning animals and animal sounds and stuff like that were making noises all the time . 169080_178880
*PAR0:	&-um were there any of the food that was familiar to her or did you have the boys at home . 178880_187540
*PAR0:	we got these little peas . 187540_188780
*PAR0:	and we got this waffle . 188780_190900
*PAR0:	&-um I'm sure we have these in the bin . 190900_194220
*PAR0:	I haven't seen them yet but we . 194220_195860
*PAR0:	haven't even dug all the way to the bottom of the bin . 195860_198460
*PAR0:	I she just I mean right away she honed in on this pink one . 198460_202360
*PAR0:	and then when I took this one away from her she found this one . 202360_205540
*PAR0:	I think the shape feels good in her mouth because it can go so far back which makes me nervous . 205540_211240
*PAR0:	but the [/] the texture I'm sure feels good to her . 211240_214560
*PAR0:	the [/] the shape is pretty . 214820_216920
*PAR0:	is she eating the cone . 217960_219820
*PAR0:	would she know what that is by name or she wouldn't know what an ice cream cone is . 219960_223440
*PAR0:	she's never seen ice cream in her life . 223460_224980
*PAR0:	okay . 225060_225220
*PAR0:	&-um peas . 225660_226300
*PAR0:	she well she knows peas . 226300_228080
*PAR0:	yeah I guess we have given you like real peas . 228380_231400
*PAR0:	yeah . 231740_232500
*PAR0:	she's just started eating her solid foods and a waffle . 232500_235600
*PAR0:	she would she's eaten but she doesn't see them like this . 235600_240380
*PAR0:	she sees them after they've been cut up . 240420_242060
*PAR0:	okay . 242780_243560
*PAR0:	and [/] and what's wrong with your voice . 244320_246800
*PAR0:	no . 246940_247720
*PAR0:	just cut . 247720_248580
*PAR0:	okay . 248980_249420
*PAR0:	how &-um about books . 250140_252220
*PAR0:	today she &-um she enjoyed the Peekaboo book . 252220_256060
*PAR0:	&-um she [/] she is a little bit familiar with it . 256060_259200
*PAR0:	but she likes &-um about anything that goes Peekaboo we've got lots of Peekaboo type books . 259200_264540
*PAR0:	lots of Karen Katz books in particular . 264660_266480
*PAR0:	but a few others where there are peekaboo things to them . 266480_269080
*PAR0:	and she [/] she likes that . 269080_270320
*PAR0:	she's just getting the concept of opening them herself . 270460_273520
*PAR0:	I mean just within the last week she's getting that concept . 274380_276840
*PAR0:	so she did enjoy that . 277080_278180
*PAR0:	she didn't enjoy it when I first pulled it up . 278240_280080
*PAR0:	and then the second time I pulled it up she was kinda into it . 280140_283140
*PAR0:	did it get a little bit more . 283320_284380
*PAR0:	mhm . 284380_284700
*PAR0:	warmed up to it . 284700_285620
*PAR0:	yeah . 285700_285980
*PAR0:	&-um was there any por part of the book or &-um page that you thought she was interested in for whatever reason more than the . 286660_295040
*PAR0:	she particularly liked the very last page with the teddy bear . 295040_299200
*PAR0:	okay . 299200_299740
*PAR0:	and I think it's because it's easier to [/] to do than some of the others that across or pull up . 299740_307380
*PAR0:	okay . 307700_307960
*PAR0:	and [/] and that's what my other daughter when she was into those books those were the first ones that she liked as well that she could pull down a more natural motion . 308380_316660
*PAR0:	mhm . 316940_317220
*PAR0:	&-um do you think there's any . 317500_320480
*PAR0:	do you think she was understanding what you were saying . 321600_323820
*PAR0:	&-um with like &-uh like the different items that she was seeing in the book . 324260_329500
*PAR0:	&-um I [/] I think that she understands what baby means . 329500_333100
*PAR0:	so when we're talking about the baby in here and this baby I I'm pretty sure she understands those . 333460_338020
*PAR0:	okay . 338300_338600
*PAR0:	she goes to daycare and she's in a room full of babies . 338740_341740
*PAR0:	so all she hears is baby [/] baby [/] baby all day long . 341960_344400
*PAR0:	but &-um but we can talk about babies . 344580_347380
*PAR0:	and she'll sort of hone in on pictures of babies . 347380_349520
*PAR0:	mhm . 349840_350080
*PAR0:	that's a clock . 351280_351940
*PAR0:	&-uh so you said she'd play with a baby doll or you two both play with a baby doll . 351960_356500
*PAR0:	what kinds of things did you do here . 356580_358420
*PAR0:	and types of things that you do at home with baby dolls . 358420_361140
*PAR0:	&-um she you [/] you like to kind of abuse your baby dolls . 362020_367900
*PAR0:	actually she I mean we just sort of played with it and kissed it and . 367900_372920
*PAR0:	she likes to you know go &-uh crawl over and pin them down to the mat and give them kisses . 372920_379600
*PAR0:	&-um she'll hold them by the hand and fling them over her head . 380380_383140
*PAR0:	but she like she gets to be very possessive of her baby dolls and likes to drag them around a little bit . 383940_389560
*PAR0:	oh that's funny . 389700_390500
*PAR0:	mhm . 390640_390920
*PAR0:	&-um is she doing anything where &-uh cause it sounds like she's treating it like a friend . 391560_397700
*PAR0:	mhm . 397820_398140
*PAR0:	you know her buddy is she doing things &-um like mimicking what [/] what how she's taking care of . 398160_404720
*PAR0:	you know <not yet> [/] not yet . 404720_406480
*PAR0:	although her sister's got a [/] a dolly stroller . 406480_409100
*PAR0:	and she's interested in it . 409100_410440
*PAR0:	but she doesn't quite get the concept of that yet . 410440_412920
*PAR0:	but she [/] she focuses on it . 413920_416200
*PAR0:	she likes to go and explore and try and figure out what it is . 416240_418840
*PAR0:	but she hasn't figured out yet . 418840_420000
*PAR0:	but it's like her stroller . 420160_421980
*PAR0:	yeah you just know that the baby doll sits in it . 421980_425080
*PAR0:	yes [/] yes [/] yes . 425080_436600
*PAR0:	oh now you're into the chicken . 436600_441660
*PAR0:	it's like . 441660_448600
*PAR0:	chicken dance . 448600_449180
*PAR0:	Elmo how do you play with the . 449180_456040
*PAR0:	how do you play with the baby . 456040_457920
*PAR0:	play didn't introduce anything yet . 457920_465780
*PAR0:	but hey here's a doll . 465780_468080
*PAR0:	why aren't you interested in playing with it . 468080_470360
*PAR0:	she was for a seconds when she didn't look interested anymore . 470360_475380
*PAR0:	I put it down and grab something else . 475380_476940
*PAR0:	okay . 476940_477460
*PAR0:	that's a truck that truck I guess . 480820_485440
*PAR0:	&-uh are there any similarity from last time . 485440_488120
*PAR0:	some things that you saw that . 488260_489300
*PAR0:	&-um she did la last time that you don't think you didn't need to do &-um still very much into the food toys . 489300_497660
*PAR0:	and [/] and she . 498100_499040
*PAR0:	hadn't seen them before last time . 499040_500820
*PAR0:	but she was very interested then . 500860_502140
*PAR0:	and she's very interested in them now . 502200_503940
*PAR0:	&-um I [/] I would say that's the biggest thing . 504800_509380
*PAR0:	mhm . 509700_509940
*PAR0:	mhm . 510200_510520
*PAR0:	okay . 511800_512440
*PAR0:	and how about any differences . 512540_513540
*PAR0:	&-um last time I was able to get her more interested in the plush toys . 514020_518900
*PAR0:	okay . 519540_519680
*PAR0:	and this time not as much she [/] she was pretty opinionated on wanting to play with the [/] the hard plastic stuff . 519680_526840
*PAR0:	that's interesting . 528040_529240
*PAR0:	yeah you think you're gonna get something good out of that cup . 529500_534800
*PAR0:	and I'm sorry you're wrong . 534800_536260
*PAR0:	but we can take care of that later . 536720_539500
*PAR0:	so she's kind of a interacting the way she's playing is similar to &-um she's interacting with him like that she would in [/] in her daily life . 539940_550220
*PAR0:	mhm . 550400_550740
*PAR0:	mhm . 551100_551420
*PAR0:	&-um can you give me an example of [/] of how she did that today . 551660_556880
*PAR0:	another example of the Mississippi Cup something else . 556880_559140
*PAR0:	she did . 559140_560240
*PAR0:	&-um the spoon . 560240_561520
*PAR0:	she's [/] she's you know taking an interest in learning how to use a spoon . 561520_565220
*PAR0:	I can't say she's learning to use a spoon . 565220_567200
*PAR0:	she's interested in attempting that . 567200_570260
*PAR0:	&-um you yes [/] yes [/] yes we're talking about you . 570260_577220
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know . 577220_582800
*PAR0:	I mean here goes the Lovey gonna steamroller the baby thing . 582800_588220
*PAR0:	&-um and now we're moving on to other things . 588220_591760
*PAR0:	&-um yeah I don't know . 592780_596500
*PAR0:	I mean she [/] she she's just starting on solid foods with I would say in the last two three weeks she's started to [/] to [/] to get those . 596640_608260
*PAR0:	and &-um so I would say that you know she's more aware of textures of things that are allowed to go in her mouth . 608780_615980
*PAR0:	so perhaps that's what . 616300_618960
*PAR0:	draws her to these . 618960_620020
*PAR0:	I don't know . 620120_620540
*PAR0:	mhm . 620660_620960
*PAR0:	I think that's a good point . 621940_622660
*PAR0:	yeah . 623100_623560
*PAR0:	maybe is she drinking &-um like a variety of different liquids too . 624220_631240
*PAR0:	mm-mm . 631240_631580
*PAR0:	no just breast milk and formula . 631580_633380
*PAR0:	and we've tried to introduce water . 633380_635340
*PAR0:	and she's not interested in water . 635340_636640
*PAR0:	but we keep trying with that . 636640_637840
*PAR0:	we're trying to introduce the sippy cup . 638320_639900
*PAR0:	and that's just a chew toy and a thing that she bangs on her tray . 639900_643240
*PAR0:	mm-hm . 643540_643800
*PAR0:	it's not a thing that she actually drinks from yet . 643880_646640
*PAR0:	okay . 647440_647840
*PAR0:	but you were really interested in that little sippy cup . 648780_651940
*PAR0:	weren't you . 651940_653460
*PAR0:	uh-huh all right I mentioned . 653460_662460
