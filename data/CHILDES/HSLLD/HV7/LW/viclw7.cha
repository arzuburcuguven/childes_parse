@Comment:	Chi resists reading the book aloud but Mot strongly suggests that she read it again. Chi reads the book , and Mot then encourages her to begin the letter. Chi begins the letter and tells Mot that she has to give her some ideas as well. Throughout this activity , Chi comes up with ideas , and Mot helps her rephrase the sentences. Mot also spells several words for Chi. Chi's brother is present during the activity , and tries to help out once in a while.
