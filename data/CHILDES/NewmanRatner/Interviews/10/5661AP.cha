*PAR0:	he was really into the food last time too . 17640_19520
*PAR0:	but [/] but he is definitely teething . 19740_22360
*PAR0:	he was more interested a lot more interested in the baby doll than he was the <last time> [/] last time he showed zero interest in it . 22420_29780
*PAR0:	and this time he had a little conversation . 29780_31820
*PAR0:	so &-uh so that was definitely a difference . 31820_35160
*PAR0:	&-um he didn't show much interest in the stuffed animals last time . 35160_38820
*PAR0:	a little bit more this time but not [/] not much more . 38820_42480
*PAR0:	now . 42480_42940
*PAR0:	look at you are you gonna go take out that camera . 42940_44740
*PAR0:	yeah . 44740_47160
*PAR0:	okay . 47160_51860
*PAR0:	I'm going to take that out . 57000_58320
*PAR0:	I'm going to take that whole thing out that way . 58320_63320
*PAR0:	I don't have to write everything down but I'll still get it if I'm holding it . 63320_66080
*PAR0:	yeah . 66080_66980
*PAR0:	maybe I'll just I can sit over on the side here we go . 66980_71080
*PAR0:	okay . 71080_72660
*PAR0:	so there were some differences . 72660_74240
*PAR0:	some differences . 74240_74720
*PAR0:	yeah . 74720_75440
*PAR0:	&-um did he show any interest in the books this time . 75440_80100
*PAR0:	I think he was interested in the books . 80100_81940
*PAR0:	&-uh the books are very similar to ones that we have at home . 82300_87060
*PAR0:	okay . 87180_87420
*PAR0:	&-um I don't know if maybe he was more interested in the things that he found to be different than what he already has because we don't have any plastic food or anything at home . 87720_98260
*PAR0:	he did a little bit of touching on the touch and feel book . 98260_104100
*PAR0:	so there are those things . 104100_107960
*PAR0:	you have some touch and feel type books . 107960_110900
*PAR0:	yeah we have . 110900_111560
*PAR0:	very similar to this one . 111560_112760
*PAR0:	we have a [/] a caring cat's book . 112760_115220
*PAR0:	that's a lift the flap book . 115220_116680
*PAR0:	and he what you what are you doing . 116680_119700
*PAR0:	and last time you said he paid no attention to the baby . 119700_123540
*PAR0:	but he did a little bit this time . 123540_125020
*PAR0:	okay a little bit . 125020_127280
*PAR0:	and &-um but he did also like the food a lot last time . 127280_131340
*PAR0:	he did also like the food a lot last time . 131340_133460
*PAR0:	okay . 133460_133700
*PAR0:	and do you think it's for any particular reason . 133700_137980
*PAR0:	and would the reason be the same last time . 138280_140820
*PAR0:	and this time &-um well I think one thing last time . 140820_146060
*PAR0:	and this time the same thing was that it was different . 146060_148000
*PAR0:	&-um and that he is still teething and likes the things he can put in his mouth . 148700_153340
*PAR0:	I don't know if he like he took the bottle . 153360_159980
*PAR0:	and he stuck it in his mouth last time with the cups and the bottles . 159980_163320
*PAR0:	<he didn't> [/] he didn't use them the way he would use a bottle that he has at home . 163320_167980
*PAR0:	so he might have viewed them a little bit differently this time . 167980_173300
*PAR0:	okay . 173300_176160
*PAR0:	and did he like any of those food items . 176160_182820
*PAR0:	like did he gravitate to any particular ones . 182820_186040
*PAR0:	the peas . 186040_187180
*PAR0:	and I think peas the texture of the plastic peas is different than the rest of them . 187180_193760
*PAR0:	so he seems to really like that and the toast and apparently waffles . 193760_201920
*PAR0:	I don't think he likes anything . 201920_203940
*PAR0:	that's in the texture some texture . 203940_206900
*PAR0:	&-uh huh yeah . 206900_210660
*PAR0:	so you did show him some of the same animals . 210660_217360
*PAR0:	okay . 217360_217820
*PAR0:	and did he &-um and did he show any interest in any of those . 217820_224200
*PAR0:	not that much . 224200_226000
*PAR0:	&-um he showed a little bit of interest in the hair of this . 226000_230940
*PAR0:	and I tried to do . 231240_233140
*PAR0:	the puppet . 233140_233920
*PAR0:	and he was interested just for a few seconds . 233920_235780
*PAR0:	and then kind of moved on . 235780_237160
*PAR0:	so . 237160_237540
*PAR0:	okay . 237540_239140
*PAR0:	and does he have anything like that at home . 239140_241320
*PAR0:	&-um he has some stuffed animals at home . 241320_243620
*PAR0:	&-uh but just a couple . 243620_246180
*PAR0:	and he'll you know sometimes he'll play with them . 246180_249520
*PAR0:	but he's just not as into them as he is into books and hard toys right now . 249520_257180
*PAR0:	so like and [/] and wires <and papers> [/] and papers . 257700_263000
*PAR0:	yeah all those good things . 263140_264080
*PAR0:	<I know> [/] I know we're torturing you huh . 264080_266660
*PAR0:	&-um let's see if you have more questions . 267520_270180
*PAR0:	so what did you think that . 272300_276200
*PAR0:	what did you spend the most time with [/] with him today . 276200_279220
*PAR0:	overall would you say . 279220_281100
*PAR0:	&-um overall I would say I probably spent the most time with maybe the books and the baby as far as what I was actually doing because I didn't really need to do a whole lot for him to pick up the food and eat it . 281560_294740
*PAR0:	we kind of discussed what he was looking at . 294740_296600
*PAR0:	but &-uh he tried to spend some time reading and &-uh did spend more time with the baby . 296600_307340
*PAR0:	definitely [/] definitely than . 307340_308660
*PAR0:	oh there's oh you found that little thing . 309240_311100
*PAR0:	yeah . 311200_311400
*PAR0:	yeah . 311760_312640
*PAR0:	he c he went over to it a couple of times . 312640_314500
*PAR0:	yeah . 314540_314720
*PAR0:	just right now when we were talking . 314780_316120
*PAR0:	yeah [/] yeah . 316640_317480
*PAR0:	oh and you said he was noticing things in the room . 317760_320560
*PAR0:	yes . 320700_321040
*PAR0:	he d towards the end he definitely started noticing &-uh you know he was looking up over there . 321040_326100
*PAR0:	and I think he was actually looking at the clock . 326160_327840
*PAR0:	I'm not sure if he made the connection between this . 328020_330340
*PAR0:	clock we were looking at and that clock . 330340_331700
*PAR0:	but it seemed like he might have . 331700_332980
*PAR0:	so you know sometimes it's hard to tell . 333120_336000
*PAR0:	but I [/] I do think that's what he was looking at over there . 336000_339400
*PAR0:	yeah . 339540_339580
*PAR0:	so and he had showed actually early on in the session showed a lot of interest in the clock . 339940_345100
*PAR0:	so yeah he did . 345100_349260
*PAR0:	and then do you think there's going back to the food items . 349260_354860
*PAR0:	I'm want to make sure I ask you do you think he would recognize the names of any of those things or any of these items . 354860_361220
*PAR0:	actually even the stuffed animals . 361220_362560
*PAR0:	would he well you know the with the food especially it's kind of interesting things . 362560_368420
*PAR0:	he spent the most time on like the peas and the toast are foods that he can actually that he actually eats right now . 368420_374400
*PAR0:	&-um he does not eat pizza . 374400_376740
*PAR0:	he does not eat ice . 376740_377660
*PAR0:	cream . 377660_377980
*PAR0:	&-um and he didn't really spend a whole lot of time on those . 377980_381100
*PAR0:	he did gravitate back towards the foods that he is allowed to eat at home . 381100_385620
*PAR0:	so maybe [/] maybe he did recognize them as familiar staples . 385620_392440
*PAR0:	so &-um as far as the toys I'm not sure he recognizes any of those animals &-um the names of any animals . 392440_403800
*PAR0:	perhaps he knows I mean he knows like doggies and kitties and that type of thing . 403800_407860
*PAR0:	we have cats . 407900_408580
*PAR0:	so he knows kitties really well . 408580_409960
*PAR0:	and I don't think there were any kitties over here . 410060_412100
*PAR0:	no but the [/] the little puppies I think he recognizes . 412360_416500
*PAR0:	mhm . 418200_418640
*PAR0:	so . 418840_419200
*PAR0:	okay . 419860_420260
*PAR0:	certainly we don't have any real bees that look like that . 420840_424980
*PAR0:	no [/] no . 424980_425420
*PAR0:	&-um and I think in the book he recognizes the animals in there . 425420_431940
*PAR0:	because those are familiar from his other book . 431940_434280
*PAR0:	true . 434280_435280
*PAR0:	and we have a lot of exotic animals . 435280_437460
*PAR0:	I don't suppose . 437460_438280
*PAR0:	suppose he [/] he would [/] would . 438280_438700
*PAR0:	yes you're he you're a [/] a real [/] real big [/] big animal [/] animal family [/] family . 438700_441440
*PAR0:	no [/] no [/] no I [/] I don't [/] don't think we've I don't think we've ever discussed otters or . 441440_445180
*PAR0:	well actually I didn't show him this one . 445180_447960
*PAR0:	but he might recognize a zebra . 447960_449320
*PAR0:	because we've looked at a lot of books that have zebras in them . 449320_451880
*PAR0:	they're fairly common . 451880_453340
*PAR0:	maybe a chicken or a rooster . 453340_458700
*PAR0:	do you know what's that . 458700_459780
*PAR0:	yum . 459780_460780
*PAR0:	well I think that's it for questions . 460780_465100
*PAR0:	okay . 465100_465520
*PAR0:	so &-um turn yours off . 465520_468500
