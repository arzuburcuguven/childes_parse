*PAR0:	like she [/] she knows the cow . 230400_232100
*PAR0:	and I mean she would know the horse and the zebra . 232100_235000
*PAR0:	I don't think she'd know like the rhinoceros but she'd know like the elephant . 235000_238700
*PAR0:	I mean more you know like common animals not common but just the ones you think of like you know the big ones I guess I don't know . 238700_247760
*PAR0:	but she didn't know what a whale or dolphin was . 247760_249800
*PAR0:	so she's not been to the Aquarium so I mean that makes a difference because then you wouldn't really know . 249800_255720
*PAR0:	yeah you know what I mean . 255880_256820
*PAR0:	so I don't know . 257000_257920
*PAR0:	yeah . 258080_258240
*PAR0:	some of these &-um animals in here are like really exotic you know . 258240_262100
*PAR0:	yeah . 262100_262260
*PAR0:	I don't even know the names of some of them . 262260_263980
*PAR0:	so . 263980_264320
*PAR0:	yeah I could definitely see that . 264400_265680
*PAR0:	well this one the one I was showing you I was like . 265940_267560
*PAR0:	I think this is I guess I don't know . 267560_270340
*PAR0:	yeah I [/] I think so beaver . 270340_271700
*PAR0:	I'm I mean yeah they're strange . 271700_273680
*PAR0:	but I'm sorry . 273680_274560
*PAR0:	I [/] I think a lot of kids tend to stick with the food . 274560_276960
*PAR0:	like at this age . 277100_277840
*PAR0:	they really like the cooking and stuff because maybe mhm they can do something with it rather than just kinda like . 277840_282960
*PAR0:	yeah . 283160_283460
*PAR0:	but although these are sorta like little scenes . 283700_286040
*PAR0:	so think maybe cute . 286040_287260
*PAR0:	they're just not old enough to get the idea . 287300_289140
*PAR0:	exactly . 289480_290160
*PAR0:	I don't know . 290340_290540
*PAR0:	I think her brother she has a four year old brother . 290620_292160
*PAR0:	I think her brother would enjoy those like I think he would probably be drawn towards that . 292280_295560
*PAR0:	but &-um I don't . 295740_296540
*PAR0:	know that's with my guess . 296540_298000
*PAR0:	I'm not sure . 298000_298480
*PAR0:	does she ever try to like play with his toys or like . 299060_301600
*PAR0:	are they . 301600_301900
*PAR0:	yeah they do they I mean she loves her big brother and tries to do most of the things he does you know . 301940_307960
*PAR0:	so . 308780_308820
*PAR0:	so . 311000_311340
*PAR0:	okay . 312460_312960
*PAR0:	was there anything that was different at all in other sessions . 313080_315860
*PAR0:	&-um I would say she's a little more since the last time that is she's a little bit more like ner not nervous . 315940_323600
*PAR0:	but she's at shy at first in new situations like she'll hang back a little . 323600_328600
*PAR0:	like when we first came in she kind of hugged me a bit . 328600_332060
*PAR0:	and sometimes when we go to a new situation she won't do anything for like fifteen minutes . 332060_335900
*PAR0:	and she'll just kind of hug me and burrow her head in my chest and not even look out . 335900_340080
*PAR0:	so I mean luckily she seemed like you know the toys kind of brought her out of her a little bit . 340080_345280
*PAR0:	but she'd definitely be more talkative than this . 345500_347620
*PAR0:	I would say . 347620_348180
*PAR0:	&-um she was a little quiet and a little more reserved but again her brother's not here either . 348900_353020
*PAR0:	so that's not typical . 353400_355440
*PAR0:	so she's used to having him . 355860_357020
*PAR0:	yeah they kind of play off each other . 357060_358840
*PAR0:	so but I mean other than that I think it was typical . 359080_362860
*PAR0:	mhm so yeah sometimes I've you know in this these sessions they sort of change their mind and wanna go like they've always been into like the stuffed you know animals . 362860_373160
*PAR0:	yes . 373180_373460
*PAR0:	they like randomly go for the food now or sometimes they always go for the food . 373640_376880
*PAR0:	so I . 377160_377640
*PAR0:	don't know if she usually go for certain . 377640_378680
*PAR0:	I think she typically has gone for the food last time though . 378680_381460
*PAR0:	I remember er a couple times she was into the books more . 381460_384920
*PAR0:	so . 384920_385340
*PAR0:	I don't know . 385340_386420
*PAR0:	well maybe the books had like the I think those were the fuzzy ones or white . 386700_390840
*PAR0:	I think that's probably what it was . 390860_392400
*PAR0:	so they were more hands on kind of things . 392580_395240
*PAR0:	don't know . 396440_398080
*PAR0:	alright . 398100_398220
*PAR0:	well I just there's one other thing . 398220_399840
*PAR0:	okay . 400020_400240
*PAR0:	have you guys read a book . 400260_401300
*PAR0:	and then . 401300_401680
*PAR0:	okay . 401780_402020
*PAR0:	you can actually leave that . 402760_403560
*PAR0:	okay . 403560_404020
*PAR0:	leave that on . 404020_404460
*PAR0:	okay . 404460_404640
