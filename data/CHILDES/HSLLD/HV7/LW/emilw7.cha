@Comment:	Chi is hesitant to write and takes a long time to get started. Mot provides most of the ideas for Chi's letter , including bringing up the holes through the pages. EXP also gives Chi idea of signing the letter. Chi pays close attention to proper spelling and is often prompted to do so by Mot. Chi does not want Mot to be able to see her work , and writes for most of the time with one arm shielding the page
