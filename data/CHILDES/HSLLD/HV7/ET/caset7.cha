@Comment:	Time is 11:47, video tape doesn't start until later; transcription is solely from audio tape until then
@Comment:	There is very little talk during this activity. Throughout , MOT and Chi engage in parallel play , independently piling and removing magnets from the base magnet. They do not cooperate at all , except once when Chi asks Mot to pick up the purple star from the base which he is having trouble with. The only talk seems to be about whether a certain piece will stick or not. Chi's younger Bro is present during this activity. For the most part he watches Chi and Mot play , and sometimes sings or talks to himself.
