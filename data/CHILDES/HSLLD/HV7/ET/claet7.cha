@Situation:	Home Visit 7
@Activities:	Magnet activity
@Types:	long, toyplay, TD
*INV:	and the last thing we wanna have you guys do together is [//] requires a little technical setup here .
@Comment:	Time is 10:42
@Comment:	MOT dominates this activity , and EXP plays a significant part in trying to get Chi to play as well. Mot and Chi seem reserved in their play with the magnets. Many pieces are kept in the box until EXP tells them that they can take them out. There isn't a lot of experimentation. Mot notices that the turtle isn't magnetic , which is about the extent of magnetic exploration. The time is spent stacking objects. Video tape does not start until later; transcription until then is solely from audio
*INV:	<we brought> [//] I brought these items for you to play with that we brought <back when you guys> [//] back when we visited you +//.

%com:	video starts here
%sit:	Chi sits on couch and Mot sits on a chair in the living room; a coffee table , on top of which are the black base and other various pieces , is in front of both of them; Mot holds box of magnets in her hand and is picking out pieces one by one while Chi watches
*MOT:	yeah .
*MOT:	can this [= silver man] stand up ?
*MOT:	look .
%act:	places a silver man on top of the black base , and continues picking out other silver men to line them up
*MOT:	(..) whoops .

*MOT:	+^ just [=? now what's] this [= yellow wand] .
%act:	picks up yellow wand and it sticks to the black base
*MOT:	oops .
*MOT:	&=laughs .
%com:	MOT is surprised; she didn't expect the yellow wand to stick so suddenly and strongly to the black base
*MOT:	these things [= black base and yellow wand] really stick .
*MOT:	look .
%act:	picks up yellow wand to look at it more closely
*MOT:	oh this [= yellow wand and silver man] sticks too .
*MOT:	he's [= silver man] standing on his head .
%act:	places the silver man which was on the yellow wand onto the black base in an upside-down position
*MOT:	let me see .

*CHI:	this way ?
%act:	turns the wand over so that the empty side of the wand is closer to the silver men; a silver man falls over
*INV:	yeah .
