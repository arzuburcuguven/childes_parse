*PAR0:	yeah . 0_2260
*PAR0:	sure . 2260_2620
*PAR0:	that's fine . 2620_3420
*PAR0:	&-uh this little fuzzy book texture book is I think like the big winner . 3420_15260
*PAR0:	yeah you want it . 15260_21300
*PAR0:	&-uh the fuzzy on the front . 21300_23940
*PAR0:	she has a another soft play you know like one of those material books at home that has a little lion's tail . 24280_32000
*PAR0:	and the tail is made out of the same thing . 32080_33760
*PAR0:	and that's like she loves that thing . 33820_36400
*PAR0:	she likes to suck on it . 36980_38720
*PAR0:	&-um yeah . 39140_43080
*PAR0:	do you like the textures you like the way it feels . 43440_47260
*PAR0:	did she like the way some felt more than others . 48480_51480
*PAR0:	yeah some she didn't . 51840_52900
*PAR0:	well I mean she was so fixated on the duck one and a little bit on the sheep that she didn't even really want to do the others . 52900_61300
*PAR0:	right . 61300_64360
*PAR0:	she didn't care at all about like the pig and things that are fuzzier or more interesting . 64360_68940
*PAR0:	yeah . 68940_71200
*PAR0:	mm . 71380_71980
*PAR0:	hm . 71980_72900
*PAR0:	do you think it was the fuzzy neck that drew her to those . 73340_76640
*PAR0:	yeah . 76780_77100
*PAR0:	like the she can pull on it . 77100_79100
*PAR0:	I think &-um she likes to do that to our cats but does not have much opportunity before they run away to pull on their fur . 79100_86020
*PAR0:	mhm . 86260_86480
*PAR0:	so &-um are you getting it . 86820_92020
*PAR0:	yes . 92260_92560
*PAR0:	oh are the I'm sorry . 92780_94100
*PAR0:	you said that it is a book like that is familiar . 94100_96720
*PAR0:	are the animal names familiar to her . 96940_99480
*PAR0:	&-um cow probably &-uh oh no [/] no [/] no [/] no [/] no the &-uh cow and probably pig . 99480_112160
*PAR0:	but she didn't really seem interested . 112560_114120
*PAR0:	it was more about Yay boom . 114320_117940
*PAR0:	&-uh I don't know that we've ever really talked about a horse . 117940_123160
*PAR0:	don't know if we don't have a book . 123920_125320
*PAR0:	or why . 125320_125860
*PAR0:	but it hasn't really come up . 125860_127260
*PAR0:	okay . 129080_130780
*PAR0:	&-um what else did she seem &-um interested in . 131660_134840
*PAR0:	&-uh she's obsessed with this pacifier which is interesting because we don't . 134860_138300
*PAR0:	she hasn't wanted to use a pacifier since she was probably about four months old . 138300_142560
*PAR0:	so &-um yeah &-um she used to just take it out and wave it around and then throw it somewhere . 142560_159060
*PAR0:	mhm . 159500_159720
*PAR0:	so we stopped using the pacifier . 159860_161880
*PAR0:	and so I'm surprised that she actually you know she obviously recognizes it and is really into just sort of chewing on it and generally sucking on it . 162360_172800
*PAR0:	mhm . 172860_173080
*PAR0:	but she doesn't use a bottle . 173300_174320
*PAR0:	&-um so I don't know if she like recognizes that it's a pacifier because she hasn't seen one in so long in like six months or if it's just that she likes chewing on things . 174320_189200
*PAR0:	and it's convenient because it's gonna stay in her mouth while she continues to play . 189200_192560
*PAR0:	I don't because like I said she doesn't use a bottle . 192980_196960
*PAR0:	she uses a sippy cup and this like little water bottle thing . 197160_199680
*PAR0:	and I nurse her . 199740_200340
*PAR0:	so she doesn't like nipples like that or not really because she is was not interested in this at all . 200540_207100
*PAR0:	right . 207220_207440
*PAR0:	so what do you do with this . 207760_208660
*PAR0:	do you know . 209020_209560
*PAR0:	oh good job . 210340_211340
*PAR0:	yeah . 212400_213140
*PAR0:	what about the little sippy cup . 213160_214960
*PAR0:	where's the sippy cup . 214960_215880
*PAR0:	here it is what types of things is she drinking . 215880_219460
*PAR0:	&-uh well this is just water in here . 219460_222240
*PAR0:	&-um she drinks pump breast milk . 222240_224680
*PAR0:	&-um when she's at daycare twice a week &-um and she drinks that out of a sippy cup because she won't take a bottle . 224680_232080
*PAR0:	I don't understand what happened there . 232440_235640
*PAR0:	but she drinks it that way . 235640_237560
*PAR0:	so &-um but yeah mostly she drinks water and then my milk &-uh and occasionally prune juice when she's having some kind of problem . 237560_247340
*PAR0:	&-uh oh no . 247520_249340
*PAR0:	yeah . 250300_250980
*PAR0:	she's obsessed with electronics . 250980_252220
*PAR0:	do you want me to keep this on or do you want me . 252220_254100
*PAR0:	just yeah . 254100_254340
*PAR0:	yeah . 254340_254500
*PAR0:	okay . 254500_254840
*PAR0:	I head on . 254840_255120
*PAR0:	&-um I'll just kind of sit here . 255120_257740
*PAR0:	okay . 257740_258040
*PAR0:	Alexa here do you want a different book . 258040_263000
*PAR0:	do you want this book . 263000_264700
*PAR0:	how about &-um any of the other toys . 264700_270080
*PAR0:	was she interested in &-um some of the play food the plastic ones that are you know shapes not really the Bl little wooden block kind . 270080_280460
*PAR0:	she wasn't interested in that . 281120_283060
*PAR0:	&-um she liked the table spoon &-um which she might recognize because &-uh she sits in the kitchen with us when we cook . 283340_291080
*PAR0:	and she gets different s relatively safe kitchen gadgets to play with like table spoons and wooden spoons and things like that . 291080_298500
*PAR0:	&-um <bless you> [/] bless you [/] you got it . 299200_304120
*PAR0:	yeah . 304860_305120
*PAR0:	where are you going now over there . 306800_311580
*PAR0:	&-um are there any foods that are familiar to her . 311580_314640
*PAR0:	&-um by name or look maybe bread . 314640_324680
*PAR0:	she eats bread . 324680_326140
*PAR0:	she eats solid food . 326140_327460
*PAR0:	so &-uh she eats bread but not really ever like this . 327460_333120
*PAR0:	she always gets like pieces . 333120_334880
*PAR0:	she's never had waffles or I'm not sure what this is supposed to be some kind of meat . 334880_342060
*PAR0:	she doesn't have &-um she eats pizza crust . 342060_346580
*PAR0:	but she doesn't usually get it looking like a little wedge doesn't eat peas . 346580_351120
*PAR0:	so she's had noodles but they don't have red sauce because they're not supposed to have . 353440_357780
*PAR0:	tomatoes yet . 357780_359160
*PAR0:	so I don't know that what she would possibly recognize out of this . 360340_364900
*PAR0:	if you had a like a Cheerio toy she'd probably be into it . 365620_368760
*PAR0:	but no Alexa come here come sit with mommy . 368820_372280
*PAR0:	come here . 372860_373980
*PAR0:	so do you think she are . 374700_376120
*PAR0:	but you said some of those foods you do eat at home . 376120_378940
*PAR0:	and so she may be familiar with names like those spoons . 379040_393840
*PAR0:	yeah bang [/] bang . 393840_396260
*PAR0:	was she interested at all in the stuffed animals . 396260_399480
*PAR0:	no she doesn't really play with many stuffed things at home . 399480_404480
*PAR0:	either . 404480_405040
*PAR0:	we have a few . 405040_405700
*PAR0:	and she's not really interested or baby dolls . 405700_410400
*PAR0:	&-um she has some very soft baby dolls but she doesn't really seem interested . 410400_415740
*PAR0:	mostly she plays with &-um blocks or &-um I guess she has some stuffed animals . 415740_425100
*PAR0:	but they all either like rattle or jingle or squish or something . 425100_429300
*PAR0:	&-um but you're not interested . 430300_432460
*PAR0:	are you here come over here . 432460_434060

*PAR0:	&-uh does she have baby dolls at home . 460000_461300
*PAR0:	mm . 461960_463340
*PAR0:	there's one but it's m it's more like a stuffed animal . 463340_466120
*PAR0:	it's like there's no hard parts on it . 466300_469960
*PAR0:	and she doesn't play . 470480_471660
*PAR0:	I think the only reason she plays with that is when she's bored because it's in the car . 471660_476920
*PAR0:	&-um but she doesn't you don't play with that kind of thing . 476920_482440

*PAR0:	oh [/] oh are you going to pull on her hair . 511600_522860
*PAR0:	so if you had to say that there was &-um a least favorite thing that you tried to introduce or tried to continue playing with her . 523780_532500
*PAR0:	what would that be a least favorite thing . 532500_540760
*PAR0:	I don't know if there was anything that I gave her that she didn't wanna play . 541380_544240
