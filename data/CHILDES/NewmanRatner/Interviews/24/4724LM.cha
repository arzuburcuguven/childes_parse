*PAR0:	and the reason is &-uh oh here it goes . 390080_393080
*PAR0:	this is the one that really goes . 393080_394360

*PAR0:	it's a pull back cool . 398780_400720
*PAR0:	we don't have one like that which is fun . 400720_407340
*PAR0:	do you have any questions . 407340_409440
*PAR0:	yes . 409440_409920
*PAR0:	articulation . 409920_410780
*PAR0:	where are we . 410780_412580
*PAR0:	&-um . 412580_412840
*PAR0:	well you know what the norm for toddlers is like . 412840_416080
*PAR0:	crazy . 416080_418440
*PAR0:	it's my turn . 418440_420500

*PAR0:	you do it . 426380_431200
*PAR0:	okay . 431200_432420
*PAR0:	&-um you're a guitar in your shirt . 432420_459240
*PAR0:	part of it is a conflation between the fact that he says a whole lot . 459240_465260
*PAR0:	okay . 465260_465620
*PAR0:	and he's very specific . 465620_466420
*PAR0:	and he has lots of syntax . 466420_468900
*PAR0:	and if he were only saying two words at a time then he'd be easier to understand than if he's got a lot to say . 468900_476100
*PAR0:	right . 476100_476480
*PAR0:	so . 476480_476780
*PAR0:	yeah it's you know it's not the time yet . 476780_480260
*PAR0:	okay . 480260_481080
*PAR0:	his sister was speaking in totally coherent paragraphs at age two . 481080_486660
*PAR0:	so completely intelligible to all outsiders . 486660_490380
*PAR0:	so it's a little difficult when I've got apples and oranges you know well except for he's got beautiful articulated play routines . 490380_498400
*PAR0:	okay . 498880_499080
*PAR0:	where he can juggle a bunch of things happening at once . 499200_502200
*PAR0:	they're all at the party . 502240_503320
*PAR0:	and they're having juice . 503320_504620
*PAR0:	and they have a cookie . 504620_505660
*PAR0:	and they you know and he's cooking things and feeding them . 505660_508600
*PAR0:	that's all really great . 508700_509740
*PAR0:	and he has a lot to say . 509920_510860
*PAR0:	mhm . 511240_511400
*PAR0:	and &-um so no it's you know that's the unofficial word is not word but we have to do the scores . 511720_520140
*PAR0:	and if they come in &-um I play with mommy but just with his history of ear infections because he went six months with a nonstop ear infection . 520140_531400
*PAR0:	yeah . 531900_532120
*PAR0:	and we almost just did tubes . 532320_534000
*PAR0:	&-um he was gonna do tubes the day before his birthday . 534500_537020
*PAR0:	and he had two clear ear checks in a row . 537300_540520
*PAR0:	so we ditched the surgery . 540760_542100
*PAR0:	and his ears have proven clear a third time now . 542880_545960
*PAR0:	so he did have a chunk of time like six months where he wasn't hearing stuff as clearly probably . 546460_551280
*PAR0:	&-um well it sounds like you're monitoring . 551980_554120
*PAR0:	oh yeah we've been . 554560_555780
*PAR0:	and he's certainly using lots of language . 556020_557740
*PAR0:	well we talk at him all day long sister . 558280_561360
*PAR0:	and I whoa baby high up high ready up whoosh boom . 561360_571980
*PAR0:	so and then go boom crazy bad . 572060_579780
*PAR0:	but you think his you know we will score the tests . 579780_586200
*PAR0:	right . 586200_586560
*PAR0:	but I know that would when you put together I know him for two year olds it's just all over . 586560_591980
*PAR0:	the map . 592000_592640
*PAR0:	yeah . 592640_592840
*PAR0:	has a huge range . 592840_594100
*PAR0:	yeah . 594100_594480
*PAR0:	because they are so different . 594480_595980
*PAR0:	yes . 595980_596280
*PAR0:	and that's normal . 596280_597260
*PAR0:	okay . 597260_597980
*PAR0:	that's good . 597980_599200
*PAR0:	I'm gonna play with mom . 599200_603620
*PAR0:	you wanna play with me . 603620_604600
*PAR0:	you know what . 604600_605280
*PAR0:	we're gonna go home pretty soon and play with Anna and Ashley it's [/] it's not [/] not a [/] a light [/] light . 605280_610980
