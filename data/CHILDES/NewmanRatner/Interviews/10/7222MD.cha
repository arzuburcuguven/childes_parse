*PAR0:	and also like at home she doesn't have any interest in soft toys . 24680_28580
*PAR0:	she's only interested in the harder objects and books . 28580_34300
*PAR0:	she does like books . 34300_35100
*PAR0:	but she doesn't really have any interest in stuffed animals or babies . 35100_39760
*PAR0:	she has one stuffed animal at home that she likes . 39760_41580
*PAR0:	but that's about it . 41580_42780

*PAR0:	&-uh she played with mostly the food . 50480_52560
*PAR0:	but it's hard . 53020_54540
*PAR0:	and that's what she likes . 54540_55620
*PAR0:	&-um she does a lot of chewing . 56420_57700
*PAR0:	she also she requested to &-um look at the book . 57800_61580
*PAR0:	she says more when she means I want . 61580_63400
*PAR0:	so &-um so she and she loves caring cats . 64120_68180
*PAR0:	and we had just we got this book out of the library last week . 68380_71700
*PAR0:	&-um but our version was missing a couple of the flaps . 72300_76160
*PAR0:	and I think she noticed that because she laughed when we got to one that because we've read the Karen Katz book . 76520_82500
*PAR0:	so often she's quite familiar . 82500_84480
*PAR0:	so she laughed when we got to one that had not been in the book before . 84480_89040
*PAR0:	&-um the umbrella was there . 89040_97480
*PAR0:	the shorts were there was not there . 97480_98940
*PAR0:	that's the one she laughed at . 98980_99920
*PAR0:	oh okay . 100060_100600
*PAR0:	&-um and the cowboy hat was not there either . 101200_104080
*PAR0:	yeah . 104220_104300
*PAR0:	yeah the cowboy hat . 104700_105840
*PAR0:	isn't that funny . 105840_106420
*PAR0:	we didn't see the cowboy hat before . 106480_107960
*PAR0:	but we saw the curtains and the teddy bear . 108360_110460
*PAR0:	&-um but she loves those books . 111900_114640
*PAR0:	okay . 115120_115420
*PAR0:	so she does likeaboo pretty regularly . 115420_127580
*PAR0:	&-um and she does if [/] if you say patty cake she'll start to clap . 127580_132520
*PAR0:	but she loses interest about halfway through she can do it . 132520_139740
*PAR0:	she this &-um my parents have a baby . 139740_145200
*PAR0:	but it's eyes open and close . 145200_147020
*PAR0:	and she's terrified of it . 147020_148340
*PAR0:	but she was not terrified of this one . 148340_150100
*PAR0:	so I think it maybe is just the moving eyes that freak her out . 150100_154000
*PAR0:	so playing with this baby was a little bit new for her . 154000_156500
*PAR0:	yes . 156500_157340
*PAR0:	yeah . 157340_157980
*PAR0:	how did she play with this one today or how did she go about playing with it . 157980_161040
*PAR0:	&-uh she offered the baby something to eat after I did that first . 161040_165720
*PAR0:	&-um and she just kinda looked at it pointing at its face touching its face . 166040_170640
*PAR0:	just the eyes especially &-um and the feet . 171100_174940
*PAR0:	oh some for me . 175960_176640
*PAR0:	thank you . 176720_177020
*PAR0:	how about the food . 178420_182740
*PAR0:	do did you say she does have food or something . 182800_184800
*PAR0:	she doesn't have any food at home . 184940_186440
*PAR0:	any play food at home . 186520_187380
*PAR0:	what were some of the items that she was picking on . 187860_190060
*PAR0:	&-um just on the basis of whether some the ones that she did if they were familiar or not or the names were familiar . 190060_197080
*PAR0:	&-um well even though she's had a lot of these foods I don't think they look like what she's had . 197640_204960
*PAR0:	so she's had a waffle . 205280_206360
*PAR0:	but before we give it to her it's cut up into little pieces . 206360_210540
*PAR0:	so it doesn't it's a do you . 210540_212440
*PAR0:	want some waffle . 212440_213120
*PAR0:	yeah . 213120_214020
*PAR0:	&-um so it doesn't really look like that . 214020_216500
*PAR0:	she's had spaghetti . 216500_217240
*PAR0:	but again it's cut up into . 217240_218680
*PAR0:	so she doesn't recognize she has had toast but it you know it's a lot darker than this . 218680_224460
*PAR0:	so even the things that she would be familiar with don't look like she would know them . 224460_230400
*PAR0:	&-uh oh you . 230400_231720
*PAR0:	okay . 231720_232660
*PAR0:	a bottle . 232660_233840
*PAR0:	and she does have bottles . 233840_235160
*PAR0:	but she's never had juice . 235160_236280
*PAR0:	so it might and it doesn't look like the bottles that she has . 236280_239620
*PAR0:	so it might not look like something that she is familiar with . 239620_244000
*PAR0:	where are you going . 244000_254240
*PAR0:	how about as far as the colors really . 254240_256500
*PAR0:	do you think she was picking up certain things based on color &-uh only in that it may have caught her eye . 256500_262280
*PAR0:	but I don't think she was picking up something because it was a certain color . 262280_265300
*PAR0:	&-um but I mean it she maybe would go after something if it caught her eye because it was bright but not because it was a particular color . 265300_273580
*PAR0:	okay . 274240_274600
*PAR0:	and did you &-um did she touch any of the animals stuffed animals or did you try to get her to play with anything in that area . 275720_282260
*PAR0:	the frog . 282260_282700
*PAR0:	well I [/] I showed her the frog . 282700_285780
*PAR0:	and then she did play with it briefly but mainly to pull at the hard tag on its back . 285780_293720
*PAR0:	so she's not really interested in the soft stuff . 293720_298320
*PAR0:	how about <the magnets> [/] the magnets . 299060_302460
*PAR0:	yeah <the oh> [/] the oh yeah she did I showed that to her . 302800_306240
*PAR0:	but she just threw it away like she's doing now . 306240_309420
*PAR0:	oh it has a hard tag on it . 309740_312820
*PAR0:	and that's why she's interested . 313500_314700
*PAR0:	is it fun . 315420_316020
*PAR0:	yeah but not the little heart . 316520_338820
*PAR0:	tag on it . 338820_340040
*PAR0:	sorry . 340040_342700
*PAR0:	exciting . 342700_345060
*PAR0:	how I did you prefer books over toys . 345060_347980
*PAR0:	wouldn't say she prefers one over the other . 348600_352940
*PAR0:	&-um if she's in the mood to sit down and look at books she can look at books for probably fifteen minutes . 352940_359420
*PAR0:	but if she's not then she has no interest in sitting still long enough . 359420_363760
*PAR0:	and her favorite books she'll look at <over and over> [/] and over again . 363760_368140
*PAR0:	or want to be read <over and over> [/] and over again . 368140_371020
*PAR0:	&-um there's a couple of Karen Katz ones that are her favorites . 371020_375120
*PAR0:	&-um recently there's a one that she likes . 375920_378540
*PAR0:	it's about bath time . 378700_379460
*PAR0:	but she just wants to be read over . 379560_380900
*PAR0:	and I think probably because the toys are novel . 380900_405860
*PAR0:	she was more interested in those . 405860_407780
*PAR0:	think if they were familiar toys she may have been more interested in the books . 408380_412360
*PAR0:	that's waffle . 413020_415480
*PAR0:	you like to eat . 416780_417780
*PAR0:	waffle . 417780_418100
*PAR0:	right . 418100_418460
*PAR0:	yum . 419040_419740
*PAR0:	yum . 419740_420020
*PAR0:	yum . 420820_421020
*PAR0:	yum . 421020_421140
*PAR0:	yum . 421140_421340
*PAR0:	you going you're such a big girl . 426700_434580
*PAR0:	yes you're such a big girl largely the same . 434580_442800
*PAR0:	I think . 442800_443240
*PAR0:	yeah Peekaboo [/] Peekaboo okay . 443240_469960
