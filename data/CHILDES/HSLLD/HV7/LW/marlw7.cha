@Comment:	Chi remembers the story so she starts writing letter right away. Mot offers a suggestion on the content of the letter , but Chi chooses to write her own ideas. Mot spends entire time flipping through and reading the National Geographic book Chi had chosen. Chi works independently for almost the entire time , but then asks for the spelling of exciting near the end of her letter. Mot is unsure , so EXP intervenes , helping Chi sound the word out and successfully spelling the word. Chi reads the letter aloud , and Mot then helps Chi with other spellings , although not realizing the misspelling of enjoyed as enjoed Upon EXP's reminder , Chi signs the letter , including Mot's name as well.
