*PAR0:	I mean we don't have any kangaroo toys or anything at home . 235740_237640

*PAR0:	and his sister has a lot of finger puppets and does little finger previous sessions in this . 240740_264640
*PAR0:	&-um well he was more interested in stuffed animals than usual . 264640_268940
*PAR0:	I think almost always . 268940_271880
*PAR0:	he just ate food everything from before . 271880_273880
*PAR0:	I think he was just like food [/] food [/] food [/] food [/] food . 273880_275340
*PAR0:	so &-um the fact that he was at all interested in anything else or would sit for any part of a book was different . 275480_280580
*PAR0:	and of course he's running around the room more than ever . 281580_284560

*PAR0:	foods that he's had so far are [/] are probably pizza [/] pizza . 296780_300600
*PAR0:	you don't think he recognized any of the dessert items that he &-uh no we don't eat a lot of ice . 301000_306720
*PAR0:	I mean I actually had an ice cream cone yesterday for the first time in like a year . 306780_309120

*PAR0:	I mean he was there but I don't even want to mention &-um peas . 310500_314360
*PAR0:	he would definitely recommend he has those a lot . 314360_316060
*PAR0:	he loves those . 316300_316840
*PAR0:	spaghetti . 317000_318340
