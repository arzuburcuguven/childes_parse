*FAT:	he seems to have gotten away from off with shirt and off with trousers . 249785_253125
*FAT:	he knows how to say . 253545_254325
*FAT:	I <take off> [/] take off your shirt . 254445_256605
*FAT:	take off your trousers . 256605_257445
*FAT:	he knows how to do that . 257445_258205
*FAT:	says . 258555_258845
*FAT:	I take off you take it off . 258965_260245
*FAT:	take off . 260355_260845
*FAT:	no . 261465_261685
*FAT:	do you know how to take off your trousers . 261785_263165
*FAT:	no . 264025_264245
*FAT:	you wanna take them off . 264585_265365
*FAT:	no [/] no . 266105_266645
*FAT:	take off . 266645_266965
*FAT:	uhuh . 267595_267885
*FAT:	okay . 268195_268485
*FAT:	he also says . 268745_269365
*FAT:	<give bow> [/] give bow . 269835_271765
*FAT:	and just like he &-uh an analogy with no give bow . 271945_275005
*FAT:	give five . 275315_275925
*FAT:	he says . 276265_276685
*FAT:	give five . 276715_277285
*FAT:	give five . 277475_278085
*FAT:	no . 279025_279245
*FAT:	give five . 279275_279925
*FAT:	give five . 280715_281325
*FAT:	no . 281665_281885
*FAT:	give five . 281885_282365
*FAT:	give bottle . 283315_283925
*FAT:	Uhuh . 284875_285165
*FAT:	no give bottle . 285585_286205
*FAT:	okay . 286275_286565
*FAT:	uhuh . 286675_286965
*FAT:	&-uh then he says . 287825_288885
*FAT:	well he was saying . 289715_290485
*FAT:	&-uh this is about the twentieth now &-uh hurt stick hurt hammer . 290565_295165
*FAT:	&-uh let's see now that was he meant the stick was hurting him or the hammer was hurting him . 295345_300885
*FAT:	so he said . 301425_301965
*FAT:	hurt stick . 301965_302525
*FAT:	so he's obviously got [/] got the agent in second position in that case . 302545_305005
*FAT:	okay . 306195_306485
*FAT:	which usually he doesn't usually has the agent . 307175_309565
*FAT:	certainly pronouns are always first as far as I can tell . 309565_312205
*FAT:	&-uh but usually there isn't an agent plus a verb . 313185_315645
*FAT:	there are very few verbs that take agents with him besides pronouns . 315695_319245
*FAT:	so that's important I think as data . 319385_321725
*FAT:	&-um okay Mary here's this about Buttercup oh by the way the give five was definitely an give bottle was definitely an analogy with give five . 322825_331555
*FAT:	I think that that's I wanna start noting some cases of analogy . 331715_335195
*FAT:	and this was clearly an analogy . 335215_336595
*FAT:	another not really an analogy was &-uh Mary said . 337145_341315
*FAT:	do you want some butter . 341315_341995
*FAT:	Mary what did you say . 342065_342875
*FAT:	I want you want some butter . 344355_345435
*FAT:	and he said . 345455_346155
*FAT:	butter buttercup . 346175_347555
*FAT:	right buttercup . 348525_349595
*FAT:	yeah buttercup [/] buttercup . 349595_351075
*FAT:	buttercup . 351185_351795
*FAT:	so Mary says to him buttercup my [/] my little buttercup . 352175_355315
*FAT:	I . 355475_355595
*FAT:	say . 355595_355755
*FAT:	what's up . 355755_356075
*FAT:	buttercup . 356075_356395
*FAT:	what's up . 356395_356755
*FAT:	buttercup . 356755_357195
*FAT:	and &-uh but I . 357825_358685
*FAT:	haven't said that . 358685_359285
*FAT:	no &-um . 359425_360005
*FAT:	recently . 361645_361805
*FAT:	yeah . 361955_362245
*FAT:	recently . 362685_362805
*FAT:	and that's the only time I ever say . 362825_364405
*FAT:	buttercup . 364405_364885
*FAT:	yeah right . 364915_365645
*FAT:	right . 366255_366605
*FAT:	okay . 366995_367285
*FAT:	so he used butter to make him think of buttercup . 367345_371085
*FAT:	and it's just it's obviously just one form leading to another form . 371665_374245
*FAT:	the meaning doesn't seem to be very important in that particular case . 374345_377085
*FAT:	so really it's more like sort of a rhyme really or a little game . 377785_380725
*FAT:	okay . 380835_381125
*FAT:	&-uh you know coming up with a word that sounds like another word . 381865_384725
*FAT:	he also &-uh he wanted to talk on the phone . 385625_387485
*FAT:	and I was in the bedroom . 387485_388245
*FAT:	and he said . 388305_388805
*FAT:	I talk phone . 388845_389485
*FAT:	I talk phone . 390085_390725
*FAT:	okay . 390795_391085
*FAT:	and then I said . 391465_392125
*FAT:	you're mine . 392345_392965
*FAT:	right . 392965_393205
*FAT:	you're my little baby or something . 393205_394405
*FAT:	he says . 394405_394645
*FAT:	I'm not yours . 394745_395485
*FAT:	okay . 395795_396085
*FAT:	I'm not yours . 396465_397165
*FAT:	okay . 397475_397765
*FAT:	and &-uh no mine that means I I'm not your [/] your little baby no mine . 399425_404645
*FAT:	okay . 405675_405965
*FAT:	another thing is I noticed that no mine . 405965_407565
*FAT:	he said we were watching . 407625_408445

*FAT:	mhm . 418865_419285
*FAT:	okay . 419715_420005
*FAT:	&-um today we were playing a nice game . 420105_421965
*FAT:	mhm . 421965_422365
*FAT:	he shoved the blanket at me . 423185_425205
*FAT:	mhm . 425205_425565
*FAT:	and say yours . 425905_427045
