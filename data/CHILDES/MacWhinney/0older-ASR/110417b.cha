*PAR0:	I just figured out before this . 4565_5885
*PAR0:	so about what absolutely . 6305_21735
*PAR1:	nothing . 24805_25295
*PAR0:	right . 25545_25895
*PAR1:	how to be would have to be nothing . 27795_33335
*PAR0:	and that would make it into . 35235_36135
*PAR0:	oh that's the point . 40425_41805
*PAR0:	yeah that's true . 41875_42805
*PAR0:	so you can't really imagine there's no way to imagine nothing . 43185_46485
*PAR0:	okay . 46675_46965
*PAR0:	no one can imagine the existence of nothing . 47425_49485
*PAR0:	right . 50975_51325
*PAR0:	because just thinking about that . 52765_53685
*PAR0:	nothing makes so . 53685_54765
*PAR1:	it's kind . 55515_56005
*PAR1:	when I about it right . 57675_59205
*PAR1:	okay . 59275_59565

*PAR1:	and I keep on trying to out . 64705_66285
*PAR1:	and I don't I can't imagine it . 68825_73565
*PAR0:	yeah it wasn't . 76875_77765
*PAR1:	anything . 77925_78205
*PAR0:	because you wouldn't have . 78555_79685
*PAR1:	then [/] then it would have to be something . 79685_82125
*PAR0:	to be . 84925_85265
*PAR1:	nothing . 85265_85465
*PAR0:	a being a black . 86185_86825
*PAR0:	see a black paper is being something . 86885_89105
*PAR1:	yes . 89485_89705
*PAR1:	be the gala . 91085_91945
*PAR1:	be nothing something . 92125_93425
*PAR0:	right . 94755_95105
*PAR0:	well I think you can accept that . 95975_97385
*PAR1:	yeah but . 98095_98585
*PAR1:	okay . 98975_99265
*PAR0:	one more . 99325_99705
*PAR0:	let's [/] let's just believe that's true . 99705_100985
*PAR0:	okay . 101135_101425
*PAR1:	one more thing . 102365_103145
*PAR0:	okay . 103575_103865
*PAR1:	personal . 106865_107145
*PAR1:	nothing . 107775_108265
*PAR0:	there's no nothing . 108975_109785
*PAR0:	okay . 109895_110185
*PAR0:	we can just forget the idea of nothing . 110185_111585
*PAR0:	skip that . 112055_114295
*PAR0:	okay . 114485_114775
*PAR0:	right . 117465_117815
*PAR0:	okay . 117885_118175
*PAR1:	so &-um I'm still ing . 118315_121015
*PAR1:	I mean you can't you can I know you haven't you know . 121255_125375
*PAR0:	oh I know is he . 125715_126655
*PAR0:	yeah . 126655_126855
*PAR0:	okay . 126855_127095
*PAR0:	you . 127155_127375
*PAR1:	wanna know &-um how if there's what what's what [/] what is beyond the doubt universe . 127375_139845
*PAR0:	what is beyond universe . 141275_142285
*PAR0:	nothing . 142555_143045
*PAR1:	and if it's not nothing it has to be something . 144185_147045
*PAR1:	and it . 148025_148445
*PAR0:	would be right . 148445_149125
*PAR0:	yeah . 150395_150685
*PAR0:	it doesn't make any sense beyond . 150685_152005
*PAR1:	that right beyond that . 152005_154165
*PAR0:	yeah . 154595_154885
*PAR1:	and that has to go forever . 157165_160185
*PAR1:	mhm . 161085_161505
*PAR0:	yeah . 164095_164385
*PAR0:	you can't really say that . 164965_167065
*PAR0:	something hasn't end . 167575_168825
*PAR0:	right . 169035_169385
*PAR0:	you can't say that it ends at a certain point unless . 169445_173025
*PAR1:	doesn't an idea . 173495_174385
*PAR0:	yeah . 174735_175025
*PAR1:	we . 179785_180005
*PAR1:	okay . 180675_180965
*PAR0:	we'll use that . 184935_185605
*PAR1:	I was just gonna say . 186765_187565
*PAR1:	maybe we are like little things . 187935_192165
*PAR1:	mhm . 192345_192765
*PAR1:	just little [/] little . 193275_194805
*PAR0:	yeah . 195915_196205
*PAR1:	little like one tiny little unseeable . 196305_201845
*PAR0:	right . 202615_202965
*PAR0:	nothing . 202995_203485
*PAR0:	right . 205895_206245
*PAR0:	like little viruses or things you know . 206245_209285
*PAR1:	there's inside a or something at in [/] in a kids' body . 209435_220445
*PAR0:	right in a kids' body . 220855_221765
*PAR0:	<a giant body> [/] a giant body . 221925_223645
*PAR0:	yeah possible . 223675_224645
*PAR0:	there's no reason that couldn't be true . 224835_226405
*PAR0:	right . 228055_228405
*PAR0:	but it would be a very strange giant . 229385_231925
*PAR1:	but still we could be viruses . 234935_238035
*PAR0:	well yeah we all we . 239335_241705
*PAR0:	well it would be . 241775_242505
*PAR1:	really I think it could be like walking around the house . 242505_244705
*PAR0:	yeah . 245345_245635
*PAR0:	but we have no reason to believe that there is anything beyond the end of the universe . 246505_253505
*PAR0:	okay . 253615_253905
*PAR1:	yeah . 254375_254665
*PAR0:	I but what we don't understand is what where the university is . 254865_260345
*PAR0:	so we can look at it in our telescopes . 260405_263225
*PAR0:	and you can see the Big bang right . 263525_265305
*PAR0:	but we are not sure . 266325_267585
*PAR0:	first of all we [/] we see things that are right . 268995_272225
*PAR0:	&-um four we think the universe is about five billion years ago . 273405_277945
*PAR0:	okay . 278015_278305
*PAR0:	and we see some very bright qua size about four and a half million years ago . 279325_283265
*PAR0:	they had their admitting radiations that was sent to us four and a half billion years ago . 286575_291465
*PAR0:	believe that . 291465_292225
*PAR0:	but now that's at the end of the universe . 294125_296665
*PAR0:	okay . 297455_297745
*PAR0:	now how did they . 298325_299185
*PAR0:	how did they get out to the end . 299325_300945
*PAR0:	if everything started in the center . 302155_303615
*PAR0:	that's what I don't understand . 306555_307735
*PAR0:	okay . 308965_309255
*PAR0:	well the big bang started in the center of the universe . 309255_311455
*PAR0:	right . 311455_311695
*PAR0:	yeah I guess or are we at each side of universe . 311695_315815
*PAR0:	which side of universe . 315815_316735
*PAR0:	are we in . 316755_317255
*PAR0:	are we the center of the universe . 317275_318415
*PAR0:	are we off on one side . 319995_321295
*PAR0:	see we know where we are in . 323155_324735
*PAR1:	down . 328105_328395
*PAR0:	isn't that good but yeah . 330565_332635
*PAR1:	maybe this . 334285_335115
*PAR0:	okay . 336905_337195
*PAR1:	maybe the middle of the universe is a big world . 337205_340635
*PAR1:	big world . 343135_343675
*PAR0:	yeah . 344425_344715
*PAR0:	yeah . 349345_349635
*PAR0:	well there's another idea which is that if you get . 349785_351955
*PAR1:	and [/] and it would suck anything . 352055_353635
*PAR0:	that's . 354775_355195
*PAR1:	just break it up and up . 355625_357445
*PAR1:	spit it . 357515_357965
*PAR0:	out that's the idea that I was thinking about . 357965_359725
*PAR0:	is that when you get to the end of the universe . 359725_361485
*PAR0:	actually you coming back from the beginning again . 361885_363765
*PAR0:	see . 367145_367365
*PAR0:	okay . 367365_367605
*PAR0:	supposedly I go up . 367725_368325
*PAR1:	I said in the middle . 368605_369445
*PAR0:	well that's in the middle but the middle . 369755_370805
*PAR1:	then you get sucked in . 371035_371925
*PAR0:	but where do you go . 372945_373445
*PAR0:	where'd you go . 373635_374205
*PAR0:	then . 374205_374445
*PAR1:	well if you last yeah . 376315_377965
*PAR1:	which is probably would be impossible . 378055_380565
*PAR0:	right . 380695_381045
*PAR0:	yeah . 381915_382205
*PAR1:	then I guess if it would go beginning . 382755_385085
*PAR3:	just go back to the beginning or . 386115_387405
*PAR1:	or . 387705_387925
*PAR3:	right . 390975_391325
*PAR3:	well that's possible . 392035_392725
*PAR1:	you just flip around . 393625_395205
*PAR3:	mhm . 395625_396045
*PAR1:	I mean it would they probably just throw you right . 397525_401325
*PAR1:	or it would just keep you or it was throw you out wherever possible . 401865_417105
*PAR3:	I wish I could January sixth nineteen ninety . 418305_424265
*PAR3:	is there any other . 435565_436385
*PAR2:	interest you . 436705_438145
*PAR3:	think besides these questions about the origin . 438145_440345
*PAR3:	other interesting questions . 445795_446905
*PAR3:	that's the main interesting about the . 446905_448425
*PAR2:	space . 448755_449105
*PAR3:	about world about the world . 449475_451065
*PAR3:	are there any other things that interest . 451525_452985
*PAR2:	you . 452985_453145
*PAR1:	&-um actually . 454485_456745
*PAR3:	have you ever . 460295_460785
*PAR2:	you ever talked about how . 461085_462145
*PAR3:	interest . 466585_466705
*PAR3:	you don't wanna know about . 467205_467905
*PAR3:	oh you know about how does it look . 467925_470545
*PAR3:	I . 470785_470905
*PAR2:	mean . 470905_471065
*PAR3:	the brain . 476645_477145
*PAR3:	how did you get the ideas you just got . 477685_479465
*PAR3:	you see what I'm saying . 481905_482605
*PAR3:	yeah . 482715_483005
*PAR3:	that's an interesting problem . 483425_484605
*PAR1:	well I heard of them . 485835_486885
*PAR2:	&-um . 490785_491005
*PAR1:	in my little pocket . 492545_494005
*PAR3:	but where's the pocket . 494505_495325
*PAR3:	and what is . 495385_495845
*PAR3:	how do you do it . 495845_496325
*PAR3:	my hand . 496425_496885
*PAR3:	what is it . 497555_498085
*PAR3:	how does it work . 498085_498645
*PAR1:	the ideas . 499425_500085
*PAR3:	yeah . 500555_500845
*PAR1:	come in and . 501155_502605
*PAR3:	you where's an idea . 502745_503565
*PAR3:	do you ever see a little idea . 503565_504525
*PAR1:	that you you're stupid . 507115_510005
*PAR3:	no . 510785_511005
*PAR3:	I'm not being stupid . 511005_511725
*PAR3:	I'm being serious . 511905_512445
*PAR3:	okay . 513595_513885
*PAR3:	here's a little idea . 513885_514645
*PAR3:	here's [/] here's I'm going here . 514645_516565
*PAR3:	my little idea . 516565_517125
*PAR3:	okay . 517435_517725
*PAR3:	now what happens to me . 517725_518445
*PAR1:	you if [/] if I hear you come in my ear I . 519805_523585
*PAR3:	listen to you . 523585_524065
*PAR3:	what do I say . 524065_524625
*PAR3:	what do my little ideas say . 524625_525625
*PAR3:	what does the idea say . 529535_530505
*PAR2:	I . 530985_531105
*PAR3:	dunno . 531115_531465
*PAR3:	how does he go in your ear . 531765_532785
*PAR2:	does . 534775_535065
*PAR3:	in your . 535265_535605
*PAR1:	ear my molecule . 535605_536885
*PAR3:	molecule . 537605_537845
*PAR2:	sounds . 549745_550165
*PAR3:	it seems to me that you're that you must do something to those sound to make them entitled . 550905_556485
*PAR3:	yes . 556665_556885
*PAR3:	they don't become ideas until they get in the brain . 557685_560215
*PAR1:	that's true . 561605_562465
*PAR3:	see what I'm saying . 564565_565185
*PAR3:	so the ideas must somebody must be inside that brain . 566045_569905
*PAR3:	do you think there's a little man in there who's doing things . 570045_572225
*PAR1:	no . 572565_572785
*PAR1:	but what I said . 572785_573705
*PAR3:	that would be a problem . 576535_577385
*PAR3:	what would his brain look like . 577735_578945
*PAR3:	so how do we get done without doing that . 584645_586345
*PAR1:	well anyway . 587135_588065
*PAR3:	maybe you have a little spirit in there . 588675_590105
*PAR3:	I'm sorry . 592965_593265
*PAR1:	okay . 593895_594185
*PAR1:	as a baby you start off right . 594685_596785
*PAR1:	and this is the basic way after that . 597845_601825
*PAR2:	everything . 602875_603545
*PAR1:	usually . 603855_604345
*PAR1:	so you hear people say . 605965_608585
*PAR1:	a tree . 608625_611305
*PAR1:	yeah . 611655_611945
*PAR1:	you look at it . 612285_613185
*PAR3:	okay . 614375_614665
*PAR1:	and so you focus on what it is . 616205_621385
*PAR1:	yeah . 621655_621945
*PAR1:	and you look at it and say . 621945_623305
*PAR1:	<that's a> [/] that's a tree . 624165_627705
*PAR1:	it's like tree . 628895_629945
*PAR3:	but maybe they maybe when they went tree maybe what they really meant was five hundred dollars . 631365_639845
*PAR3:	that tree cost five hundred dollars because it said . 641635_643405
*PAR3:	five hundred dollars . 643405_644365
*PAR3:	yeah . 649795_650085
*PAR3:	can you just listen to me . 650705_651725
*PAR3:	okay . 651755_652045
*PAR3:	I'm sorry . 652065_652405
*PAR3:	okay . 653275_653565
*PAR3:	okay . 653715_654005
*PAR3:	tree . 654035_654325
*PAR1:	you know how . 654785_655365
*PAR1:	parents . 655435_655925
*PAR1:	yeah . 656315_656605
*PAR1:	say to their little babies . 656825_658005
*PAR1:	right . 658255_658605
*PAR1:	yes . 659465_659685
*PAR1:	the couch . 660425_661005

*PAR1:	oh yeah I do . 1449645_1450485

*PAR0:	I learned that from mom . 1507885_1508805
*PAR1:	but mom doesn't do it anymore . 1509305_1510765
*PAR0:	because I do it all the time . 1510955_1512285

*PAR0:	well I didn't get to tell you what I wanted to tell you . 1547435_1549765
*PAR1:	okay . 1549995_1550285
*PAR1:	what . 1550285_1550485
*PAR0:	what this was my theory about other creatures on other planets . 1550485_1554245
*PAR0:	okay . 1554435_1554725
*PAR0:	mhm . 1555225_1555645
*PAR0:	you my theory . 1556505_1557285
*PAR0:	yeah . 1557475_1557765
*PAR0:	my theory is that what's gonna be interesting in our lifetime is that we're going to find out that when we've learned to decode this that there are signals being centralist <from other> [/] from other planets . 1558185_1572285
*PAR0:	okay . 1572755_1573045
*PAR1:	well we're sending signals to them . 1573075_1574885
*PAR0:	yeah . 1575155_1575445
*PAR0:	but they're not gonna get them for hundreds of years . 1575465_1577165
*PAR0:	but <there were> [/] there were signals that were sent perhaps a million years ago a hundred years ago by other races that were probably much more civilized than we are . 1578385_1591125
*PAR0:	and we just have to figure out how to decode those signals . 1592625_1595205
*PAR0:	do you see what I'm saying . 1596025_1596805
*PAR0:	and they'll be telling us all sorts of secrets about the world . 1596825_1599565
*PAR1:	hey babe . 1603185_1603645
*PAR1:	you wanna come over and . 1603665_1605045
*PAR0:	dance tonight . 1605045_1605565
*PAR0:	now what we have to do is figure out how those signals are being sent to us . 1605585_1608645
*PAR1:	yeah . 1609925_1610215
*PAR1:	and we can send them back . 1610215_1611335
*PAR0:	mm . 1611995_1612215
*PAR0:	it won't be that easy . 1613315_1614095
*PAR0:	well because of the great distances . 1614925_1617175
*PAR0:	oh they won't get them . 1617835_1619335
*PAR0:	we won't be able to talk like on telephone . 1619435_1620975
*PAR1:	yeah . 1621285_1621575
*PAR1:	but [/] but I mean if they send sneaking to us . 1621635_1625455
*PAR1:	and yeah we find out . 1625875_1627535
*PAR1:	I mean we could it would it might be possible for us to make it's a big mic . 1627695_1633935
*PAR1:	another thing . 1633965_1634935
*PAR1:	I mean it's probably not very possible then . 1635695_1639415
*PAR1:	yeah it might be possible to make . 1639415_1642535
*PAR1:	yeah the same thing . 1642845_1644695
*PAR1:	yeah . 1644845_1645135
*PAR1:	and then we could just send them back and forth . 1645595_1647775
*PAR1:	it would take a very long time to send it back . 1649075_1653655
*PAR1:	yeah . 1653655_1653935
*PAR1:	but . 1653935_1654055
*PAR0:	work in our lifetime . 1654245_1655175
*PAR0:	you see all we can . 1655275_1656015
*PAR0:	but we can learn a great deal from these to you understand what I mean . 1656395_1660835
*PAR1:	the only problem is which is just as big . 1661455_1663555
*PAR1:	&-uh we won't be it . 1663695_1666115
*PAR1:	we might not learn a great deal because it takes so much time . 1666215_1669395
*PAR0:	to [/] to because you down . 1670695_1671715
*PAR1:	yeah . 1672105_1672395
*PAR1:	no . 1672695_1672915
*PAR1:	to for them to tell us the great deal . 1673055_1676035
*PAR0:	well what . 1676985_1677875
*PAR1:	what you just said . 1679185_1680035
*PAR1:	it takes a long time to travel . 1680295_1681715
*PAR0:	yeah . 1682145_1682435
*PAR0:	but all those ideas have always been sent to us . 1682455_1684555
*PAR0:	and they're coming into us right now . 1685525_1686985
*PAR0:	that's true . 1689855_1690395
*PAR0:	they were sent maybe a million years ago . 1691705_1693235
*PAR1:	but they keep on coming . 1694135_1695235
*PAR0:	they're coming right now . 1695785_1696875
*PAR0:	it was sent a million years ago . 1698855_1699995
*PAR1:	see how . 1699995_1700435
*PAR1:	how do you know they're coming though . 1700455_1701715
*PAR1:	well what kind of signals are they light signals . 1702425_1705635
*PAR0:	probably [/] probably &-um radio signals . 1705835_1707715
*PAR1:	radio . 1708085_1708435
*PAR0:	mhm . 1708655_1709075
*PAR0:	radio frequency . 1709365_1710315
*PAR0:	okay . 1714705_1714995
*PAR0:	it could be beamed in our direction . 1715655_1717195
*PAR1:	I know this is kind of funny . 1717475_1718555
*PAR1:	but I don't think anything could be more civilized than bees . 1718575_1723115
*PAR0:	oh no . 1724095_1724515
*PAR0:	I don't believe that at all . 1724515_1725315
*PAR0:	could easily be more civiliz . 1726045_1727075
*PAR1:	civilized . 1727075_1727515
*PAR1:	I mean possibly . 1727515_1728275
*PAR1:	yeah . 1728825_1729115
*PAR1:	if [/] if there's another world with peace and that would be more civilized than us . 1729175_1734795
*PAR0:	well that would be any world just for starters . 1735385_1737435
*PAR1:	I mean any world . 1738315_1739235
*PAR1:	yeah . 1739505_1739795
*PAR1:	any world that has &-um high life with peace would be better than our would be more civilized than our world . 1740495_1751675
*PAR0:	okay . 1752305_1752595
*PAR0:	well that would be a good start . 1752595_1753595
*PAR0:	that is my world and other what other things . 1753595_1756835
*PAR0:	what other things do you think would have . 1759305_1760715
*PAR0:	&-um well to be better than us . 1761615_1763675
*PAR1:	what how do we send them messages . 1765225_1767315
*PAR0:	well we started by &-uh I think I'm trying to remember how we code special code . 1768545_1775595
*PAR0:	and &-um . 1777615_1778155
*PAR1:	you know what you . 1779015_1779795
*PAR0:	do what . 1779795_1780435
*PAR1:	if it was possible we could send them the code . 1781705_1785485
*PAR0:	oh the . 1786585_1787165
*PAR0:	okay . 1787315_1787605
*PAR0:	one of the codes has to do with the &-um frequency of methane . 1787665_1792605
*PAR2:	hmm . 1793725_1793845
*PAR0:	has to do with the frequency of methane . 1794465_1795965
*PAR2:	what about Meth . 1796875_1797605
*PAR0:	okay . 1797835_1798125
