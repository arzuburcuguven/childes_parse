*INV:	you know sometimes after having read a book people write to the author ?
@Comment:	sometimes Mot seems a little uncomfortable with the task , but overall she and Chi are both competent and confident. Chi reads part of VHC (from Saturday page on) aloud before writing. Both Mot and Chi have ideas that are put into the letter. Chi writes in cursive. Except for confirming that she should start with dear Chi doesn't need help with spelling or form. Short and effortless (9:45 but only a few minutes in which letter is written).
